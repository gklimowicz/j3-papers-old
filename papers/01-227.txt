Subject: Unresolved issue 324

1. Introduction

Issue 324 notes that we use "host" and "host scoping unit" interchangably,
but that the words used to describe them in the glossary are slightly
different.  It suggests that we just define "host" as short for "host
scoping unit", like we do for "object" and "data object".

I concur.  Edits are supplied

2. Edits to 01-007r1

[402:19-20] Replace with "<<host>> (2.2): Host scoping unit."

[402:21-30] Delete J3 note 324.
