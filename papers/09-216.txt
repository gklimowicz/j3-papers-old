Subject: Minor editorial suggestions
Date: 2009 April 30

[66:29] 4.5.4.1 C444/C445
  Break line before the beginning of C445 which got attached to C444.

[67:13] 4.5.4.1 C454
  After "the interface" insert "of the procedure pointer component".
{This is the only thing it could be, but makes it more readable.}

[71:Note 4.35+6,11] 4.5.4.7
  "NAME_LEN) NAME =" -> "NAME_LEN) :: NAME =";
  "= MEMBER (" -> "= MEMBER (9) (".
{Correct syntax errors.}

[77:11] Index "abstract type" as a definition.
{Abstract types are poorly explained in the standard, but reorganising and
 adding extra explanation is beyond the scope of this paper.}

[159:24] Rename "7.2.2.2 Syntax"
         to "7.2.2.2 Syntax of the pointer assignment statement".
{7.2.2 is "Pointer assignment", but this is just the statement syntax,
 and anyway we want to cross-reference it.}

[160:7] 7.2.2.2, C719/C720
  Break line before the beginning of C720 which got attached to C719.

[189:27] 8.5.1 Image control statements, p2
  "Any ... coarray." -> "any ... coarray;".
{Fix list syntax.}

[291:11] Rename "12.1 Syntax" to "12.1 Syntax of a procedure reference".
{12.1 is "Procedure reference", but we want to cross-reference this.}

[301:30] 12.5.2.12p3 item (4)
  "that meets the requirements of (7) or (4) in 7.1.12"
  ->"that is a constant expression"
  or more conservatively,
  "that meets the constant expression requirements (4) or (7) in 7.1.12".
{As it happens, (4) and (7) are the only parts that it can meet right now,
 but the shorter version is simpler and clearer.}

[327:5-6] 13.6p2
  This is duplicative and confusing (it mentions 2 out of the 3 cases), and
  has no references: replace with plain text (a note would be technically
  ok, but stylistically poor).
    "Note that a specific function that is marked with a bullet (\bullet)
    is not permitted to be used as an actual argument (12.5.1, C1236), as
    a target in a procedure pointer assignment statement (7.2.2.2, C730),
    or as the interface in a procedure declaration statement (12.4.3.6,
    C1215).".
{After my other changes above, 12.5.1 is "Syntax of a procedure reference",
 7.2.2.2 is "Syntax of the pointer assignment statement", and 12.4.3.6 is
 "Procedure declaration statement".}

[328:end of page] 13.6 at end
  Insert new note
    "Note 13.x
     A specific

[474:2+] C.1.4p2, after "SUBROUTINE RENDER_X(OBJECT, WINDOW)",
  Insert new line appropriately indented
    "IMPORT DRAWABLE_OBJECT, X_WINDOW".
