Subject: Incorrect table references as result of chapter renumbering
Date: 2017 April 10


Discussion:

When the document was reordered and chapters renumbered, two table
reference were not updated to reflect their new chapter numbers.
Section 18.2.1 contains references to Table 15.1 and Table 15.2.
It appears these should be 18.1
and 18.2 respectively.

Edits:

18.2.1 Summary of contents p1 page 483 line 19
  Change "Table 15.1" to "Table 18.1" and "Table 15.2" to "Table 18.2"
