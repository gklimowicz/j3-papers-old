Interp F03/0139 as balloted
---------------------------

Interp F03/0139 passed WG5 letter ballot with three comments

"In the edit for [407:21-22] change 'which' to 'that'."

"The edit at [417:18] should be: Change 'of the result variables' ...

"The word 'which' in the edit for [407:21-22] is correct."

There is a minor change to item (3) of the answer.

The term (not a defined term) "function result" already has a different
meaning that the interp didn't take into account.

Subgroup considers the interp to have failed.

Slightly revised edits are presented for posterity to ponder.

NUMBER: F03/0139
TITLE: Functions returning procedure pointers
KEYWORDS: procedure pointer
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

(1) Is a function permitted to return a procedure pointer?
    Much of the language talks about the function result variable,
    but a procedure pointer is not a variable.  For example, 2.2.3
    says [12:16]
       "The VARIABLE that returns the value of a function is called
        the RESULT VARIABLE."
    (emphasis mine); which indicates that the value of a function is
    returned in a variable.

(2) Where may a function reference that returns a procedure pointer
    appear?  In particular,
    (a) as a <selector> in a SELECT TYPE or an ASSOCIATE statement;
    (b) within parentheses as a primary;
    (c) as the argument to an intrinsic inquiry function such as
        KIND or LEN.

(3) [12:18-19] says
      "a subroutine may be used to change the program state by
       changing the values of any of the data objects accessible
       to the subroutine".
    A procedure pointer is not a data object, so is this meant to
    imply that a subroutine is not permitted to change the state of a
    procedure pointer?  Similar text for functions appears in the same
    paragraph.

ANSWER:

(1b) Yes, a function is permitted to return a procedure pointer; the
     text calling this a variable is in error.  Edits are supplied to
     correct these mistakes.

(2b) It was intended that a function reference that returns a
     procedure pointer only be permitted as an argument to the
     ASSOCIATED and NULL intrinsic functions and in places where an
     ordinary procedure name would be acceptable.  Parentheses around
     a pointer act to dereference the pointer and return a copy of the
     value: this action is inapplicable to procedures. Thus the
     answers to the specific sub-questions are No, No, and No again.
     Clarifying edits are provided.

(3) No, this implication is not intended.  A clarifying edit is
    provided.
