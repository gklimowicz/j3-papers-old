Subject: F202Y Intrinsics for source location
Date: 2023-June-15

Reference: 23-154

Users have requested a way to get the source name and source line
in their programs, as well as the current procedure name.  Uses for
this would be as a debugging aid, perhaps for logging purposes, etc.

This can be done with many preprocessors today; the gcc spellings
are __FILE__ and __LINE__ for example map onto the source filename
and the source line number.  And this could also be part
of the Fortran preprocessor feature request as well, of course.

To avoid the requirement of a preprocessor, this proposal is to create
module intrinsics, similar to COMPILER_OPTIONS and COMPILER_VERSION, 
and nominally called SOURCE_FILE, SOURCE_LINE and PROCEDURE_NAME, that
can be called in the user program to retrieve this information.   

These should be useable in constant expressions or specification
inquiries, again, similar to COMPILER_OPTIONS and COMPILER_VERSION.
