Subject:   Variables in a BLOCK construct in a DO CONCURRENT construct
From:      Van Snyder
Date: 2015 February 10
Reference: 15-007

There was some correspondence about variables being separately private
to each iteration of a DO CONCURRENT construct.

Declaring them in a BLOCK construct within a DO CONCURRENT construct
(ought to) make them separately private to each iteration.

A note to this effect would be helpful.

[180:5- NOTE 8.11+] Insert a note:

"NOTE 8.4a
  A variable declared within a BLOCK construct within a DO CONCURRENT
  construct has a separate instance for each iteration of the DO
  CONCURRENT construct.
"

Alternative positioning: [174:10- NOTE 8.4+]

The list in 8.1.6.5p1 applies to these variables, without needing any
change.
