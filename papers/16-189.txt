1. Introduction
===============

The edit for [16-007:389:17] from 16-130r1 was shortened to remove "is
not the same variable as TO and" because FROM and TO are not permitted
to be the same variable unless both are unallocated.  Users have trouble
finding this distant prohibition, and, having not found it, at least
some of them make the assumption, not always incorrect, that intrinsic
procedures might somehow be "magic," and in this case not do anything if
FROM and TO are the same variable.  That is, FROM remains allocated if
it was initially allocated.  At [16-007r1:403:31 13.9.137p4] we included
"if the allocation status of TO is allocated, it is deallocated."  This
follows from 12.5.2.6p7 so we don't technically need to say it, but we
found it helpful.  It would be equally helpful to keep the entire edit
from 16-130r1.  A note to the effect that FROM and TO are prohibited to
be the same variable unless both are unallocated would be larger, and
more confusing than using eight extra words to say, effectively, "If
FROM .and. .true."

Edit for [16-007:460:47] was rejected on the grounds that "when" is
correct, and "where" sounds very odd.  Actually, "when" is incorrect
because whether a variable has a deferred type parameter is a static
property, not a run-time-varying property.  If "where" sounds odd, how
about replacing "when" with "if" at [16-007r1:476:47]?
