From:    Dan Nagle
Subject: libm math functions
Date:    2005 October 13


At Delft, it was decided to pursue the libm procedures.
This paper attempts to provide edits to do so.
The specifications are in 05-132r2, pursuant to J3-038.
In short, this paper attempts to provide Fortran standard names
for some procedures already existing in the C language math library;
it is not to specify wholly new procedures.

Specification: Add subsections to Section 13 detailing
               the Fortran names for these procedures from the C libm:
               j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn, erf, erfc, hypot, tgamma, lgamma.
               (Some of the C names should not be used due
               to the common usage, in Fortran, of names such as j0 etc.)

                        The functions are (the C names):

                        Bessel functions (j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn)
                        Error functions (erf, erfc)
                        Hypotenuse (hypot)
                        Gamma and log gamma (tgamma, lgamma)

                        The detailed mathematical specification of these
                        procedures is given in the references above.
                        The intention is to allow the vendor to use
                        the procedure supplied by libm, so the exact
                        specification is left to libm, which is most likely
                        what the applications programmer wants.

                        Edits include adding to the list in 13.5.2:

                        BESSEL_J0
                        BESSEL_J1
                        BESSEL_JN
                        BESSEL_Y0
                        BESSEL_Y1
                        BESSEL_YN
                        ERFC
                        ERF
                        GAMMA
                        HYPOT
                        LOG_GAMMA

Syntax:

There is no new syntax.  The procedure names are as above.
The calling sequences are the same one- or two- argument sequences
as the C versions.
