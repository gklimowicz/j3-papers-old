DISCUSSION

Most of the intrinsics with an optional DIM argument disallow the
corresponding actual argument being an optional dummy argument
because its presence or absence affects the rank of the result.

F08/0003 points out that a disassociated pointer or unallocated
allocatable variable would be regarded as absent and therefore
needs to be excluded too. It proposes to add the restriction in
some cases and in others to rewrite the function as an overloaded
pair, one with a DIM argument and one without.

F08/0038 points out that the restrictions are pointless when the
function is described as an overloaded pair.

Describing all the relevant functions as an overloaded pair seems
to me to be the best solution. This is detailed here.

TITLE: Is a disassociated pointer allowed as an actual DIM argument?
KEYWORDS: DIM argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Several intrinsic functions, such as ANY, have a DIM argument, with
the rank of the result depending upon whether it is present.  There is
a prohibition against the actual argument being an optional dummy
argument, but not against it being a disassociated pointer or
deallocated allocatable.  Is the following program standard
conforming, and if so what does it print?

  program DIM_Arg
    integer, pointer :: Dim => NULL()
    logical :: Mask(2,2) = &
      & reshape( (/ .true., .false, .false, .true. /), (/ 2, 2 /) )
    print *, shape( any(mask,dim) )
  end program DIM_Arg

The description worked until we allowed a disassociated pointer or
unallocated allocatable variable that is associated with a nonpointer
nonallocatable optional argument to be interpreted not to be present.

ANSWER:

It was intended that this program not conform. The edits of F08/0038
address this issue.

NUMBER: F08/0038
TITLE: Are pointless restrictions on DIM arguments intended?
KEYWORDS: DIM argument, optional, intrinsic reduction function
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

DISCUSSION:

Some of the reduction functions have two forms, one with a DIM
argument and one without; the DIM argument is not optional.  IALL is
an example.  Other reduction functions have a DIM argument that is
optional.  COUNT is an example.  The actual argument corresponding to
the DIM actual argument is prohibited from being an optional dummy
argument in both cases.  The reason in the case of an optional DIM
argument is so that the processor can determine the rank of the
result.  In the case of those with two forms, there is no problem for
the processor to determine the rank, so the prohibition against the
corresponding actual argument being an optional dummy argument is
pointless.  There is already a prohibition against it being an absent
optional dummy argument in 12.5.2.12p3(4) [299].

Consider, for example

  subroutine S ( ARRAY, DIM )
    integer, intent(in) :: ARRAY(:,:)
    integer, intent(in), optional :: DIM
    if ( present(dim) ) then
      print *, iall(array,dim)
    else
      print *, iall(array)
    end if
  end subroutine S

This subroutine clearly does not conform, but a processor would have
no difficulty determining the rank of the result of IALL(ARRAY,DIM).

QUESTION:

(1) Was the pointless restriction intentional, or was it an oversight
that it did not get removed in the two-form case when MAXLOC etc. were
added?

(2) Is it necessary to continue the pointless restriction?

ANSWER:

(1) This was an oversight.

(2) No.  Edits are provided to remove it.

Furthermore, if the intrinsics that are written with an optional DIM
argument are rewritten in the other form, the pointless restriction is
removed for these, too. This would also render interp F08/0003 mute.
