1. Edits
========

[295:16 14.1p3] Replace the paragraph with a note:

"NOTE 14.2a
  It is impossible for a reference to a Fortran main program to appear
  in any program unit, including itself."

[297:20 C1410] Constraint C1410 ought to apply both to R1411 and R1413.
Insert "R1411" before "R1413", using either blank or comma for a
separator.

[298:18+ 14.2.2p9+] 14.2.2p11 at [298:22-25] begins "The appearance of
such a module...."  The "such a module" to which it refers is the one
described in 14.2.2p9, two paragraphs earlier.  14.2.2p10 is about a
different subject. Move 14.2.2p11 at [298:22-25] to [298:18+ 14.2.2p9+],
making it 14.2.2p10.

2. Question without edit
========================

C1406 prohibits a scoping unit to access both nonintrinsic and intrinsic
modules of the same name.  Is it permitted or prohibited for a
nonintrinsic module to access an intrinsic module of the same name as
itself?  Of the three processors I have, two prohibit it, and one allows
it.  Either a constraint to prohibit it, or a note to remark it is
allowed (or not prohibited), seems to be needed.  Does this need an
interp?
