1. Introduction

These comments address deficiencies in the exposition of "recursive",
which are even more apparent now that procedures can be called recursively
by default.

The defects are twofold:
(1) declaration is NON_RECURSIVE not RECURSIVE;
(2) "recursive" means that it calls itself; this is not a static
    attribute.

These edits have no bearing on the recursivity or otherwise of
CHARACTER*(*) functions, as these are specified elsewhere not to
be capable of recursion (whether they have NON_RECURSIVE or not).


2. Edits to 17-007r2 (N2137)

[303:7] 15.4.1 Interface and abstract interface, p1,
        After "and whether"
        change "is recursive"
        to "has the NON_RECURSIVE attribute".
        Making that sentence read:
   "The characteristics and binding label of a procedure are fixed, but
    the remainder of the interface may differ in differing contexts,
    except that for a separate module procedure body (15.6.2.5), the dummy
    argument names and whether it has the NON_RECURSIVE attribute shall be
    the same as in its corresponding module procedure interface body
    (15.4.3.2)."

[329:28] 15.6.2.1 General, p2,
         After "specified to"
         insert "have the NON_RECURSIVE attribute, or to",
         and later delete "recursive,",
         Making the whole paragraph read:
  "A subprogram is specified to have the NON_RECURSIVE attribute, or to be
   elemental (15.8), pure (15.7), or a separate module subprogram
  (15.6.2.5) by a prefix in its initial SUBROUTINE or FUNCTION statement."

[333:32-33] 15.6.2.5 Separate module procedures, p3,
            Change "It is recursive if and only if it is declared to be
                    recursive"
            to "It has the NON_RECURSIVE attribute if and only if it was
                declared to have that attribute",
            and change ", and if" to ". If"
            making the whole (now two) sentence(s) read:
   "It has the NON_RECURSIVE attribute if and only if it was declared to
    have that attribute by the interface body. If it is a function its
    result name is determined by the FUNCTION statement in the interface
    body."
