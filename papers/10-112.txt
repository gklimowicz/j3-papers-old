DISCUSSION

The difference between SYNC IMAGES and SYNC ALL should be clarified.


EDIT

[190:15+]In 8.5.4 "SYNC IMAGES statement" at the end of Note 8.37, add

"In the following example, each image synchronizes with both of
its neighbors, in a circular fashion.

INTEGER :: up, down

up = THIS_IMAGE()+1; if (up>NUM_IMAGES()) up=1

down = THIS_IMAGE()-1; if (down==0) down=NUM_IMAGES()

SYNC_IMAGES( (/ up, down /) )

This might appear to have the same effect as SYNC ALL but there is no
ordering between the preceding and succeeding segments on non-adjacent
segments. For example, the preceding segment on image 3 will be ordered
before the succeeding ones on images 2 and 4, but not those on images
1 and 5."
