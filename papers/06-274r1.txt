Date: 14 August 2006
To: J3
From: Dick Hendrickson
Subject: typos and editorial suggestions for INTRO to clause 
         4, 6, and 12
References: J3/06-007

Comments that I believe are merely editorial and have no
technical impact or merit. Editorial comments on MACROS are
in the macro paper, not this one.

General edit questions

1) Is there a way to add the defining rule number in the
BNF for things that are far away. For example
R448 component-initialization is initialization-expr
and initialization-expr is defined way off in C 7.

Withdrawn, no action proposed

2) In some/many cases Rules do not have a blank line
between them, whereas constraints always seem to. Makes
it hard to read the rules when they are close together.
See, e.g., [120:13-22]

Straw vote: all the same?  ad hoc?

Specific edits

XV The laundry list needs to be redone at a later time. I
suggest going down the list of things in spread sheet
and having a big feature and a little feature list.

Add J3 note for future action

[1:12] Add after "length" 

"; part 2 has been largely
subsumed by allocatable characters with deferred length 
parameters."

[2:40] change "(16)" to "(2.2)"

[3:15] This seems to say the new .XOR. has a different
precedence from what it had before. It didn't have
one before.

Withdrawn, deferred to paper 06-212

[6:2] Clause 4 has constraints with 3 digits. 
Edits:
[6:2]   Replace "Csnn" with "Csn"
[6:3]   Replace "nn is a two digit" with 
        "n is a two digit or three digit"

Van suggest the following clause 4 related edits:
[65:17]  Replace "POINTER or" with "Neither POINTER nor"
[76:34]  Append to the end of the sentence "to that name"

[12:7] To my eye on my printer, this line looks like it has
a smaller font than the others.

Withdrawn, no action

[12:6] Change "are to be" to "may be". Also in [13:25].
The current wording sounds like they must be
available, but availability is controlled by a USE
statement.

Withdrawn

[13:34] "the ancestor" implies to me the immediate unique
ancestor. Can't it be declared in any ancestor?

Withdrawn

[15:13] change "a procedure" to "a Fortran procedure". 

[21:21] There are two instances of "may be accessed". The
first is really a requirement, the second is mostly
expressing an option. Replace the first clause to
refer only to co-array elements on other images and
say "may only" and use some form of "may or may
not" on its own image.

Withdrawn

[41:22] Delete the phrase "considered to be" which
implies that it's a matter of opinion.

Editorial suggestion:  Check all cases of "considered to be" 
and "said to be" for deletion or rewording.

[42:note 4.1] Delete the phrases "by design" and "are
designed to be" because they imply doubt. In line one of the
note, change "is known" to "is always known".  In the last 
line, change "Generics ... to be" to "All generic 
references are"

[44:1] Add a forward reference for extensible type, "(4.5.7)"

[44:30] Add a note explaining that if A is type compatible
with B, that doesn't imply that B is TC with A
Insert after [44:30] as a note
      "Given
TYPE TROOT
  ...
  TYPE,EXTENDS(TROOT) :: TEXTENDED
  ...
  CLASS(TROOT) A
  CLASS(TEXTENDED) B
  ...
  A is type compatible with B by B is not type compatible with A."


[53:3] The processor only defines the collating sequence
for some character sets. ISO_10646 and ASCII are
well defined. The default character set sequence is
partially defined.
This also (possibly) affects [52:22-23] and the text
that should be moved here from [25:16-21]

Withdrawn

[53:note 4.14] My Japanese is a little rusty, does this
translate to "always buy the NAG compiler"?
Add at the end of the note "This translates to 
'Without her, nothing is possible'".

[54:26] Delete this line. It's the only sub header under
bits and none of the other types have one like
this.

[54:28-29] Bold font "kind" and "representation method".
All of the other types have theirs bolded.

[54:32] For bits, it would be user friendly to add a note
saying that they use "kind" more like the character
length parameter and people shouldn't get confused.
Particularly because the standard is weak at
keeping separate the distinction for characters.
I'm sure I've seen things like "ASCII type".

Withdrawn

[61:note 4.27] I'd expand on the explanation by saying that
length type parameters don't participate in generic
resolution, only the KIND ones do. And that a KIND
parameter can (also) be used as in a length-like
way, but not vice-versa.

Withdrawn

[64:note 4.34] Add, before the line declaring SYNOPSIS

PROCEDURE(printer_interface),POINTER :: PRINT => NULL()

And, after "TITLE," in the text, insert "a procedure pointer, 
PRINT, with an explicit interface the same as 
printer_interface, "

[57:6] Add a forward reference for extensible type
withdrawn

[65:27] Need "and" before "does not".
Note to editor:  Should R449 and C462 from page 65 be moved 
to page 84:23+ where initialization is discussed (R505) and 
text 65:5-7 and 65:26-27 be moved to 85:15+ ?

[115:9] Delete "The"

[115:12] Delete "A"

[126:16] Add " but its parameters must be defined" 
at the end of the sentence.

[131:note 6.31] In the penultimate line add "if it was
allocated" before the full stop.

[330:7-12] Could we change "separate" to "sep" or vice
versa in the linked bnf terms?

Defer to /B group
