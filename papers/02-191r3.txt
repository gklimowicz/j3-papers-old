To:       J3
From:     Richard Maine with edits by Interop/Meadows
Subject:  Pre-meeting editorial fixes

The following edits are copied from 02-191 with only one change. The
reference for the edit changing the bolding of Volatile was corrected
to be [85:4,6] rather than [81:4,6]

EDITS

  Fixed table numbering (was mixed up with note numbering).

  [55:3] Added missing space after "type."

  Added index entries for "numeric sequence type" and
  "character sequence type" in 5.5.1 and 16.4.3.3.

  "bindind" -> "bindings" in Note 4.48.

  [59:3] ", and" -> "; it"

  [60:2,23] Removed space in "<keyword> =" (4 times); otherwise it
  is confusing to parse.

  [84: last line of note 5.20] "this" -> "thus"

  [85:4,6] Bolded the instance of "VOLATILE attribute" on line 4
  instead of the one on line 6.

  [85:18] Added a comma.

  [91:9] Deleted extra "statement".

  [381:3] 6.5.5.3->6.7.5.3

  [105:18+] Hyphen changed to em-dash in last line of Note 6.4.

EDITS ADDED

The following edit was suggested in 02-191 and implemented
here:

[75:27]  Add index reference for CLASS

02-195 reorganized the annexes by merging the index of syntax
terms with the general index and moving the general index to
the end of the document. This edit was mistakenly included
in the r2 of this paper. It has been removed. Please include
the edits from 02-195.
