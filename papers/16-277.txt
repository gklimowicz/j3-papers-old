Discussion:

In 8.5.8.7 Assumed-rank entity, C838 has limitations on what can be
done with assumed-rank objects.  The list was expanded from the
initial version to allow assumed-rank arguments to intrinsic inquiry
functions.  But now that we allow both BIT_SIZE() and SIZE(), it seems
reasonable to also allow C_SIZEOF from ISO_C_BINDING? The information
available from BIT_SIZE() and SIZE() are enough to compute C_SIZEOF().
I think this was probably an unintentional omission.

Edit to 16-007r2:

[107:16-17] In 8.5.8.7 Assumed-rank entity, in the second constraint
(C838), change "function C_LOC" to "functions C_LOC and C_SIZEOF".
