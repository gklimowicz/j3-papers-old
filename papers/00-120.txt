Typos:

[65:39-41] Move Note 5.3 after [65:47]
   The note currently sits amongst the constraints, but doesn't refer to a
   preceding constraint.

[79:9] Change "nore"
       to     "more"

[83:5] Change "if"
       to     "of"

[394:26] Change "|"
         to     ":"

The following items were missing in the fix for issue 147 in 99-205r2.  Those
edits introduced a <language-binding-spec> for use in the BIND statement,
BIND attribute and BIND <prefix-spec> syntax, but neglected to complete the
changes for the BIND <prefix-spec>.

[265:40] Change "BIND(C [, <bind-spec-list>])"
         to     "<language-binding-spec>"

[266:1]  Change "BIND"
         to     "a <language-binding-spec>"

[266:4]  Change "The BIND <prefix-spec>"
         to     "A <prefix-spec> that is a <language-binding-spec>"

The following edit was missing from the fix for issue 163.  That issue required
binding labels to not be treated as global entities, but rather as things that
identify global entities.  The glossary entry for entity still includes a
binding label in the list of things that are entities.

[397:13] Delete ", a binding label"

In paper 00-101, Rich Maine points out that paper 99-270r1, in addressing issue
165, contains a reference to the edit for [411:35+] in 99-205r2, but fails to
specify what should be done to that edit.  The following edits remedy that, and
partly address issue 218.

[391:22-25] Replace paragraph with

   "A C variable with an external definition (6.9 of the C standard) created
    by means of a companion processor (2.5.10) can be declared in a program
    by means of a variable declared in the scope of a module or by way means
    of a common block.  Such a Fortran variable or common block shall have the
    BIND attribute."

[391:37-42] Replace sentence beginning "A C variable" (including numbered list)
   with

   "Two variables or common blocks in a Fortran program shall not have the same
    binding label.

    A variable in a common block corresponds with a member of a C struct type
    if and only if the variable appears in the same relative position in the
    common block object lists used to declare the common block in the scoping
    unit as the member appears in the declaration of the C struct type.  A
    common block interoperates

      (1) with a variable of a C struct type, if the number of variables
          declared in the common block object lists used to declare the common
          block in the scoping unit is equal to the number of members of the
          struct type, and the variables in those common block object lists
          interoperate with the corresponding members of the C struct type; or

      (2) with a C variable, if the common block object lists used to declare
          the common block in the scoping unit contain a single variable, and
          that variable in the common block object lists interoperates with
          the C variable."

[392:30] Change "associated with that variable."
         to     "linked with that C variable.  A Fortran variable or common
                 block that is linked with a C variable shall interoperate
                 with that C variable."

[391:29-35] Delete sentence that begins "In addition, . . ." to end of note.
   I believe that the issue raised by the first sentence still needs to be
   resolved, but the two preceding edits address the two issues raised by the
   second sentence and second paragraph of the note.

[399:18] After "12.5.3"
         add   ", 16.2.7.1"

[399:19] Before "It"
         insert "When a C variable with external linkage has the same binding
                 label as a Fortran variable or common block with the BIND
                 attribute, they are said to be linked."

Issue 229.  Paper 99-205r2 introduced a subclause for the term binding label
and added a reference to it.  Paper 99-270r1 removed the subclause without
adjusting the reference.  These edits remedy that.

[341:13] Change "(???)"
         to     "(12.5.2.7, 16.2.7.1)"

[341:14-18] Delete Unresolved issue 229.
