NUMBER: F03/0101
TITLE: Is UDDTIO output suitable for namelist and list-director input
KEYWORDS:
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:

The first paragraph of 10.9.2 says that the form of the values 
produced by list-directed output is the same as that required for 
input.  It also says values are separated blanks or commas, etc.

The first paragraph of 10.10.2 has similar words for namelist output.
It also requires that the variable name be produced in upper case and 
that the output consist of name-value pairs.

Is it intended that output produced by used defined derived type 
routines conform to these rules?

ANSWER:

No, it was not intended to constrain the user derived type output 
values.  There should be an exception similar to the one for adjacent 
un-delimited character values.  User derived type output fields do not 
need to be readable by either namelist nor list-directed input

EDITS:

[241:3]  After "undelimited character strings" insert " or possibly 
output produced by a user-defined derived output routine"

[241:5]  Add at the end of the paragraph
"The form of the output produced by a used-defined derived type output
routine invoked during list-directed output is specified by the 
invoked routine.  It need not be compatible with list-directed input
or output."

[246:4]  Replace "and logical values" with "logical values, and possibly output produced by user-defined derived type output"
\
[246:4-5]  After "undelimited character strings" insert " or possibly 
output produced by a user-defined derived output routine"

[246:7]  Add at the end of the paragraph
"The form of the output produced by a used-defined derived type output
routine invoked during namelist output is specified by the 
invoked routine.  It need not be compatible with namelist input
or output."
