Discussion

The first part of NOTE 9.4 should be normative.


Edits to J3/07-007r1

[208:24] In 9.2 External file, move the first two lines of NOTE 9.4:

"Named files that are opened with the TEAM= specifier (9.4.5.17) have
the same name on each image of the team. Apart from this, whether a
named file on one image is the same as a file with the same name on
another image is processor dependent."

to become normative text at the end of para. 3.
