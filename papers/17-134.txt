Subject: Note implication

1. Introduction

The editor's report notes that the wording of NOTE 12.44 has a mild
implication of compile time checking for child data transfer statements,
which simply cannot happen.

This paper suggests rewording this to avoid such an implication.


2. Edit to 17-007

[17-007:249:16+2-3] 12.6.4.8.3 Executing defined input/output data
                    transfers, NOTE 12.44, replace the contents of the
                    note (which is just one sentence) with
  "A data transfer statement with an ID=, POS=, or REC= specifier cannot
   be a child data transfer statement in a standard-conforming program."
