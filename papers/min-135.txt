                         by Craig T. Dedo
                        November 28, 1995

1 Monday, November 13, 1995
  A regular meeting was held at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, November 13, 1995 in the Lisbon Conference
Room at the Ramada Inn San Diego North, 5550 N. Kearny Mesa Road, San Diego, CA  92111.  Jerrold
Wagener was in the chair and Craig Dedo took the minutes.  

1.1  Opening Announcement
Larry Rolison is a brand new graduate of the ANSI school of rules and procedures.  He learned a lot about
the expectations that ANSI has of officers of ANSI sponsored standards efforts. Larry Rolison asked that
we take a vote to declare the meeting to be duly called in the event we had unknowingly violated any
ANSI, X3, or other governing body rules regarding meeting validity.  We expect to take this action at the
beginning of each meeting.
Motion:   X3J3 declares this meeting to be a duly called meeting.
Moved:    Larry Rolison              Second: Craig Dedo
Action:     Passed by unanimous consent.

1.2  Meeting 135 Objectives and Chair's Report
Discussion Leader:  Jerrold Wagener
There are 7 major objectives.
1.   Produce the Fortran 95 Draft International Standard (DIS).  WG5 the previous week (November 6-10,
       1995) sent Fortran 95 out with a few holes for us to fill.  Each subgroup will get an assignment. 
       There will be no formal votes on the Fortran 95 DIS unless members ask for some.
2.   Produce response letters to the public review comments and vote on the final language.  Each letter
       needs to pass by a 2/3 vote.
3.   Assist John Reid, the Project Editor, in completing the Technical Report (TR) on Floating Point
       Exception Handling.  John Reid would like X3J3 to be closely involved with the development
       work.  WG5 changed the rules for developing a TR. [Reference: 95-273, p. 2]
4.   Review the initial list of Fortran 2000 requirements and present them with a report and analysis.
5.   Produce 6 liaison / response reports on:
    Floating Point Exception Handling
    Interoperability with C
    Allocatable Components, Allocatable Dummy Arguments, and Allocatable Function Results
    Parameterized Derived Types
    Conditional Compilation
    Fortran 2000 Requirements
6.   Decide whether we accept the invitations from WG5 on two subjects:
    Do we want to be the maintenance body for Fortran 95?
    Do we want to be the primary development body for Fortran 2000?
7.   Develop responses to the WG5 resolutions.

1.3  Adoption of the Agenda
Discussion Leader:  Jerrold Wagener
Presented as mailed with changes proposed by Jerrold Wagener (see Appendix A).

Motion:   Adopt the agenda with the changes as proposed by Jerrold Wagener.
Moved:    Craig Dedo               Second:   Stan Whitlock
Action:     Passed by unanimous consent.

1.4  Approval of the Meeting 134 Minutes
Discussion Leader:  Jerrold Wagener
Reference:  95-249, Meeting 134 Minutes

  Extensive discussion on the content and format of the minutes.  Following are the major points
covered in the discussion.  Specific amendments to the content are not included.
 We need to be aware of and responsive to political sensitivities.  Including a lot of detail and
     background information may aggravate political sensitivities.
 In many organizations, people often get punished for saying anything that their superiors do not like. 
     This is why many bureaucrats will say little or nothing of substance on the record; they fear that
     whatever they may say will come back later to haunt them.
 It is important to reflect the essence of the technical argument.  However, we need to work in an
     informal, cooperative spirit.  Recording a lot of detail may intimidate people.
 We generally have a scribe for long discussions.  The Secretary should not try to be a discussion
     scribe.
 There were a number of errors.
 Accuracy is far more important than including background information.
 Local arrangements should not be in the minutes.
 The post-meeting distribution did not arrive until two months after the meetings.
 Normally, the minutes includes a list of all of the papers.  This is required by the SD-2.
 Is there a scorecard for what happened to the papers?
 Some members would like pure ASCII text, rather than PostScript or word processing documents.
 It is possible to put the minutes on the X3J3 server.

  Members presented numerous amendments.  All were approved by unanimous consent.

Motion:   Approve the minutes as amended.
Moved:    Janice Shepherd            Second: Stan Whitlock
Action:     Passed by unanimous consent.

Action Item:   Craig Dedo should prepare a revised copy of the minutes incorporating all of the
                 amendments and issue a paper 95-249r1.

1.5  Meeting 134 Action Items
Discussion Leader:  Craig Dedo

1.             Kurt Hirchert  Check out whether the auto-unzip feature on the X3J3 server works yet.
               He checked but it is still not working.  Kurt will keep encouraging the staff of the
               server to make it work.
               Status: Continuing.

2.             Craig Dedo  Send a copy of X3J3 and US TAG minutes to Jerrold Wagener for his review prior
                           to sending them to the X3J3 Mailing List or to Kurt Hirchert for inclusion in the
                           post-meeting mailing.
               Jerrold Wagener was unavailable when the minutes were prepared so Craig Dedo
               sent them to Larry Rolison.
               Status: Closed.

3.             Larry Rolison  Did the interpretations at the Tokyo WG5 meeting pass the WG5 ballot?
               No.  However, WG5 approved them at the recently concluded meeting.
               Status: Closed.

4.             Craig Dedo  Check with Ivor Philips to see whether he still has the list of publications that he
                           sent information and press releases to.
               Ivor Philips does not have any part of the list, either paper or electronic.
               Status: Closed.

Action Item:   Jeanne Martin will check to see if she has a copy of the list in her office.

Action Item:   Craig Dedo should prepare a copy of the August 1995 US TAG meeting minutes as soon
  as possible after this meeting concludes.

1.6  Treasurer's Report
Discussion Leader:  Mallory North
Reference:  95-248, Treasurer's Report for Meeting 135
All bills are paid.  There is no meeting fee for this meeting.  The regular meeting fee of $100.00 will be
reinstated starting with meeting 136.

1.7  Membership Report
Discussion Leader:  Larry Rolison
Reference:  95-262, Record of X3J3 Letter Ballot Votes, 1/94 through 10/95

 Bruce Bush is replacing Bill Lassaline as the representative for Lahey Computer Systems.
 Jim Himer, Exxon, cannot make it to this meeting. 
 Linda O'Gara of Microsoft has not resigned.  If Microsoft does not send anyone to this meeting, its
     membership will lapse.
 In the next membership summary, Larry Rolison will delete identification of institutional members.
 What happens to memberships if people switch organizational affiliations?  For example, Jerrold
     Wagener recently retired from Amoco.  Will he have to attend a meeting as a non-voting
     applicant?  Is there a way of immediately terminating an institution after the former employee
     separates from the employer but still serves on X3J3?
 Hewlett-Packard (HP) is buying out Convex.  The acquisition will be finalized on December 20. 
     Richard Bleikamp will still have a separate vote on the upcoming interpretations ballot.  He will
     not officially represent or be an alternate for HP until the start of the next meeting.
 The membership rules apply to both meeting attendance and letter ballot voting.  A member will be
     dropped from membership if he or she meets either of the following criteria:
     Meeting attendance  Miss 3 out of the last 4 meetings
     Letter ballots      Miss 3 consecutive letter ballots
These criteria do not apply to TAG votes.

Current Membership:                        22
Quorum:                      8

       95-275, Resolutions of the WG5 Meeting on 6 to 10 November 1995 in San Diego, CA

Here is a summary of the major decisions of the WG5 meeting recently concluded.
 There is a revised strategic plan for Fortran 2000.  This includes the revisions to the TR process that
     X3J3 requested.
 WG5 issued a Fortran 95 Draft International Standard.
 WG5 is asking X3J3 to be the primary development body for Fortran 95.
 WG5 developed a preliminary list of requirements for the Fortran 2000 revision.  This will need to be
     refined later.
 The TR on Interoperability with C is moving ahead.  Michael Hennecke was just appointed to be the
     project editor.
 The TR effort on Data Type Enhancements has been split.  The part on Parameterized Derived Types
     (PDT) was removed from it into a separate collateral development effort.  Dr. J. Steve Morgan will
     lead the development work on PDT.  WG5 may make PDT a fourth TR at its meeting in July 1996.
 There is interest in developing a facility to support interval arithmetic.  WG5 is asking persons to
     bring proposals for technical development work to the next WG5 meeting.

Call to order at 8:30 a.m.

2.1    Subgroup Reports and Processing
Edit
Discussion Leader: Richard Maine
Reference: 95-278, Responses to Fortran 95 CD Ballot

  The Edit Subgroup has reviewed the F95 DIS through Chapter 5.  So far, 17 editorial items have been
fixed.  There are three places which may prove difficult:
 37:39+  This is waiting for X3J3 action on the definition of a direct component.
 62:17   BOZ constants.  Are there consistency and redundancy problems?
 55:12+  Here we made technical changes that are incompatible with Fortran 90 but are compatible
            with all existing implementations.  We removed the restriction that objects with the
            POINTER attribute cannot be implicitly typed.

Interpretations
Discussion Leader: Janice Shepherd
Reference:  95-261, 95-006 Status
       95-263, F95 CD Edits Delegated to X3J3

  The Interpretations Subgroup has started looking through the interpretations that passed recently
to see that they are incorporated into the F95 CD.  Then, Interpretations will start looking through
corrigendum 3 in order to make sure that all of the items in it are included.

Parallel
Discussion Leader: Dick Hendrickson

  The Parallel Subgroup met with Janice Shepherd and talked about the IBM comments.  It would like
some time in plenary so that John Reid could present his tutorial on the Exception Handling TR and take
some straw votes.

JOR
Discussion Leader: Kurt Hirchert
Reference:  95-253, Response to IBM Comment on Fortran 95
       95-264, Fortran 2000 Requirements
       95-265, Fortran 2000 Requirements Processing at X3J3 Meeting 135

  JOR is working to refine the draft response letters.  It will draft a shorter version of the IBM response
letter.  Later, JOR will tackle the items in the preliminary list of requirements.  In the initial review, the
members of JOR will attempt to evaluate each feature in three areas:
 The cost of standardizing the feature
 The cost of implementing the feature
 The benefit of the feature to users of Fortran

2.2    Tutorial on Floating Point Exception Handling
Discussion Leader: John Reid
Reference:  95-277, Floating Point Exceptions

  The subgroup discussion proposed several changes.  Following is a brief summary of the subgroup's
thinking.
  1. There should be two modules.
     USE IEEE_SUBSET       ! Provides minimal support, runs fast.
     USE IEEE_ARITHMETIC ! As proposed in the original version of 95-277.

  2. Should some capabilities be functions or subroutines?
     The proposed functions, IEEE_GET_FSR and IEEE_GET_ROUNDING_MODE, are not pure; they
will become subroutines.  IEEE_GET_FLAG is also not pure but is awkward as a subroutine.

Straw Vote: IEEE_GET_FLAG - Are you very uncomfortable if it is a subroutine?
           5   Yes                         11  No               2  Undecided

Straw Vote: IEEE_GET_FLAG - Are you very uncomfortable if it is a function?
           5   Yes                8  No               3  Undecided

Straw vote: Which is the preferred form for IEEE_GET_FLAG?
          10   Subroutine                7   Function                2  Undecided

  3. All of the IEEE_SUPPORT functions need an argument X, to see if the inquired about
functionality is available for the same kind as X.  Is there a way to inquire about support for all KINDs
with one function call?

  4. The proposal will make more use of arrays of the exception flags as arguments.

  5. More specific functions will be merged to become functions that are generic over the defined
exception flags.

  6. What kind of IEEE floating point support would the IEEE_SELECT_REAL_KIND return?  

  7. Should there be special syntax for intrinsic modules?  For example,
     USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC

Straw Vote: Do you like this idea or something like it?
          10   Yes                3  No               5  Undecided

  8. We would add a rule that these procedures cannot be used as actual arguments in procedure calls.

2.3    Letter Ballot Voting Record Discussion
Discussion Leader: Larry Rolison
Reference:  95-262, Record of X3J3 Letter Ballot Votes, 1/94 Through 10/95

  Some members are in danger of losing their membership due to frequent missed letter ballots. 
According to ANSI rules, any member who misses 3 out of the last 4 letter ballots loses their membership
due to inactivity.  Members should carefully review the paper to see if they are in danger.

Recess for subgroups at 10:15 a.m.

Call to order at 8:30 a.m.

3.1    Subgroup Reports and Processing
JOR
Reference:  95-257, Conditional Compilation: the FCC Approach
       95-264, Fortran 2000 Requirements
       95-265, Fortran 2000 Requirements Processing at X3J3 Meeting 135

Conditional Compilation (CoCo)
Discussion Leader: David Epstein
Reference:  95-279, Specifications and Requirements for CoCo
       95-280, Recognizing the Fortran INCLUDE for CoCo

  There are two evolving definitions for a CoCo facility.  Both need quite a lot of work.
     1.   Existing practice, generally assumed to be some derivative of cpp, the C language
            preprocessor.
     2.   A Fortran-like pre-processor.

  What do we want to do about INCLUDE?  Would modules be preferable to INCLUDE?  

Straw Vote: Do we want to recognize the Fortran 95 INCLUDE facility in CoCo?
          14   Yes                0  No               0  Undecided

Additional issues that members mentioned include:
 Is there any interaction between INCLUDE and USE?
 CoCo variables should behave just like regular Fortran variables.  We should not introduce more
     irregularities.
 File dependencies are a bad idea.  Although INCLUDE introduces some file dependencies, we should
     work hard to minimize additional dependencies.  The meaning and execution of a Fortran
     program should not change solely due to what file or files the source code is compiled from.
 What is the scope control for meta-variables?  If there are conflicting declarations when files are
     concatenated, we will have file scoping.
 Are we going to have meta-variable assignment statements beyond meta-variable declarations?

Parameterized Derived Types
Discussion Leader: Richard Maine
Reference:  95-288, X3J3 Liaison Report on Parameterized Derived Types

  The biggest area of difficulty is with the inquiry functions.

Interoperability
Discussion Leader: Henry Zongaro

       95-294, Draft Interoperability TR
       95-295, HPF Calling C Interoperability Proposal, Version 1.2

  There will be a meeting after dinner to discuss ideas on interoperability.  Anyone who is interested
is welcome to attend and should contact Henry Zongaro.

Other JOR Items
 There will be a paper later with all of the draft responses to the public review comments.
 There will be at least 3 related papers listing administrative side actions which X3J3 must accomplish
     in order to make the responses true.
 The JOR Subgroup expects to get into the evaluation of the items on the B list for Fortran 2000 later
     in the day.

Action Item: Jerrold Wagener should contact Miles Ellis and verify that 95-265 item B1 is actually the
  top priority for Fortran 2000.

Interpretations
Discussion Leader: Janice Shepherd
Reference:  95-281, 95-006r4 Status Changes per WG5 Meeting
       95-263, Fortran 95 CD Edits Delegated to X3J3

  There is a new WG5 policy on interpretation processing.  Any item which is approved by X3J3 and
WG5 will appear in the Technical Corrigendum 3.  Any item which was approved by WG5 but sent back
to X3J3 will be subject to an X3J3 letter ballot.  There is no longer any chance of answering any
interpretation requiring edits.  Such items will become Fortran 95 interpretations.  However,
interpretations which do not require edits can still be answered as part of the Fortran 90 maintenance

Edit
Discussion Leader: Richard Maine

  The Edit Subgroup has reviewed the Fortran 95 CD up to and including the Annex A edits.  So far,
there have been 41 editorial changes.  Once the Edit Subgroup is finished with Annex C, it will put all of
the editorial changes into a paper.  With several items, the Edit Subgroup still has to wait for X3J3 action.

4.2    Liaison Reports
Discussion Leader:  Henry Zongaro
References: 95-288, X3J3 Liaison Report on Parameterized Derived Types
          95-293, X3J3 Liaison Report on Interoperability
          95-307, X3J3 Liaison Report on Floating Point Exception Handling TR
          95-308, X3J3 Liaison Report on Allocatable Components TR

  There are no more comments on 95-307 or 95-308.

  An informal group met Wednesday night to discuss the TR on Interoperability with C.  From the
discussion, it is obvious that we do not even have a proper problem definition yet.  There also is a problem
with the scope and size of the project.  Those who met made a very rough guess as to the amount of work
required.  They believe that a complete, high quality TR will require much more effort (i.e., labor hours)
than is currently available.  

  There was discussion on paper 95-288.  There will be revisions to the paper and it will come back
later.

Recess.

Discussion Leader: David Epstein
Reference:  95-266, X3 Subgroup Annual Report
       95-283, Draft X3J3 Responses to the WG5 San Diego Resolutions
       95-296, X3J3 Liaison Report on Conditional Compilation (CoCo)

  Do we really need this liaison report?  It is important to record our decisions and make sure that they
are copied to WG5 and other X3J3 members.  We are not yet sure which of the two approaches to CoCo
we will take.  A revised paper will be available this evening.

  There was some discussion on papers 95-283 and 95-266.

Action Item: Jerrold Wagener should go back to the SD-10 and check to see whether all of the information
  listed in Section III.c is required to be in the annual report.

Action Item: Walt Brainerd should contact William B. Clodius and get clarification of his intentions in
  paper 95-300, PFR on Flexible Accessibility.

Recess for subgroups.

4.3    Subgroup Reports and Processing

  Jerrold Wagener reported that he got an answer from Miles on whether we are authorized to make
minor technical changes to the Fortran 95 CD.  The answer is yes.

5.5    Future Meetings
See also Appendix C.

  Walt Brainerd cannot host the February meeting unless we postpone it for 2 weeks.  Should we hold
all meetings next year in Las Vegas, NV?  This is close enough to NASA Dryden so that Richard Maine
can drive and provide computer support.  We would need someone to make the arrangements.  If we did
this, we would need to book the hotel at least 3 weeks in advance.  

  The next WG5 meeting is the last week of July in Dresden, Germany.  Do we want the August meeting
to be in Boston, which is on the way back from Germany?

Straw Vote: Do we want the 1996 meetings to be in one city or move the meetings around the country,
               like we have been doing?

           8   Las Vegas            0   Some other place               5   Undecided

Straw Vote: Would holding the February meeting the week of February 26 be OK as a backup date?
           8   Yes                0  No                 5   Undecided

           Future Meetings and Distribution Assignments

Meeting conventions:
- 4 meetings per year
- attempt to schedule second full week of month
- attempt to schedule meetings back to back with WG5 meetings

At meeting 135, the committee considered meeting primarily in Las Vegas, NV for 3 out of the 4 meetings next
year.  However, no hotel arrangements had been made with any Las Vegas venue by the close of the meeting so
the tentative hosts are still listed below for the 1996 meetings.  If the February, May, and November meetings
are held in Las Vegas, they tentatively will be held the same weeks as the meeting dates shown below.  David
Levine has not yet been contacted about hosting the July/August meeting, but since he has offered several times
in the recent past to host a meeting, he is the current tentative host for that meeting, subject to his approval and
ability/willingness to host.  Also, if the May meeting takes place in Champaign-Urbana, Kurt has notified the
committee that the date may need to be changed so as not to conflict with graduation at the university.
