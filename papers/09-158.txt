Discussion:

UTI 164 (page 299) points out that a paragraph that is intended to address
array coarrays has an unintended consequence for scalar coarrays.

An edit is supplied to correct this.

------------

Edit to 09-007r1:

[299:4]. In 12.5.2.8 Coarray dummy variables, para. 2, change
'a coarray' to 'an array coarray'.
