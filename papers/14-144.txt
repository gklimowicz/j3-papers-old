Subject: clarity of the definition status of empty sets
Date: 2014 April 17

After being asked a question about definition of objects with no
nonpointer components, and email discussion ensued on the j3 list.
The outcome of that discussion prompted this paper.

Briefly, consider a derived type having no nonpointer components.
A scalar object of such a derived type is always defined, but
this status must be deduced.  Furthermore, a similar situation obtains
with zero-sized arrays and zero-length strings, but the status
of these entities is specifically described.  The following edit
is intended to describe the definition status
of these similar objects similarly.

Edits against 14-007:

{clarify the definition status of some derived-type scalars}

[459:15} replace "Zero-sized arrays" with
"Derived-type scalar objects with no nonpointer components,
zero-sized arrays,"
