Subject:   Comment GB037; potential misunderstanding with locality-spec
Date: 2017 October 17

1. Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GB 037 suggests that [191:17] 11.1.7.2 "Form of the DO construct" Para 1
C1126 might be misunderstood to mean that a variable can only appear in
one locality-spec in a whole scoping unit

An edit is provided to address this.

2. Edit:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[191:17] C1126, after "in a <<locality-spec>>" insert
"in a given <<concurrent-locality>>".

The full contraint would read:

C1126 The name of a variable shall not appear in more than one
<<variable-name-list>>, or more than once in a <<variable-name-list>>,
in a <<locality-spec>> in a given <<concurrent-locality>>.
