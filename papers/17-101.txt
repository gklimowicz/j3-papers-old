NUMBER: F08/
TITLE: Limitions on coarray by C526 and associating selectors
KEYWORDS: ASSOCIATE, coarray
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following code:

   SUBROUTINE CO_ASSOC

      IMPLICIT NONE

      INTEGER, PARAMETER :: P = 5
      REAL, ALLOCATABLE :: A(:,:)[:,:]

      ALLOCATE (A(P,P)[2,*])

      ASSOCIATE (I => A(1:P,1:P))
      END ASSOCIATE

   END SUBROUTINE CO_ASSOC

Is the associating entity 'I' in the above code considered to be
a coarray?  Does this conflict with Fortran 2008 C526?

ANSWER:

From 8.1.3.3, one has

   Within an ASSOCIATE or SELECT TYPE construct, each associating
   entity has the same rank and corank as its associated selector.
   ...
   The cobounds of each codimension of the associating entity are
   the same as those of the selector.

From 5.3.6.1, one has

   The CODIMENSION attribute specifies that an entity is a coarray.
   The coarray-spec specifies its corank or corank and cobounds.

So, the associating entity 'I' acquires corank and cobounds from
the selector.  Only a coarray has corank and cobounds.  If 'I' is
considered to be a coarray, then Fortran 2008 C526 seems to impose
very limiting conditions on a coarray as an associating selector.

   C526 A coarray or an object with a coarray ultimate component
        shall be a dummy argument or have the ALLOCATABLE or SAVE
        attribute.

From 16.5.1.6, one has

   If the selector is allocatable, it shall be allocated; the
   associate name is associated with the data object and does
   not have the ALLOCATABLE attribute.

Inspection of the above code shows that the associating entity
'I' is not a dummy argument, does not have the ALLOCATABLE
attribute via 16.5.1.6, nor the SAVE attribute.

Suggested edit to C526

   C526 A coarray or an object with a coarray ultimate component
        shall be a dummy argument or have the ALLOCATABLE or SAVE
        attribute or shall be an associating selector.
