Subject: Clarification of global identifier

#Reference: 18-007r1

Introduction
------------
Consider the following code fragment:

module m1
  interface
    subroutine sub1() bind(c, name="samec")
    end
  end interface
end

module m2
  interface
    subroutine sub2() bind(c, name="samec")
    end
  end interface
end

program main
  use m1
  use m2
end

[497: 26-27] 19.2 Global identifier:
"A binding label of an entity of the program is
a global identifier."

Therefore, the global identifier of both sub1 and sub2 is "samec".

[497: 28] 19.2 Global identifier:
"The global identifier of an entity shall not be the same as
the global identifier of any other entity".

Question:
Does this sentence invalidate the above code fragment?

Answer:
NO. The above code fragment is valid.

The work "entity" in [497:28] means global entity.
An edit is provided to clarify it.

Edit to 18-007r1
----------------

[497:28] 19.2 Global identifier:
Insert "global " before "entity" in the first sentence twice.
It reads:
"The global identifier of an global entity shall not be the
same as the global identifier of any other global entity."
