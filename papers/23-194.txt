Subject: F202Y Add maximum rank/corank constants to ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
Date: 2023-June-14

With the advent of assumed-rank, along with templates and generic
programming, it can be useful for a program to know what the maximum
possible rank and corank is for the current processor. The standard
requires specifies 15 (rank and corank together may not exceed
15), but we deliberately changed SELECT RANK to allow higher
values in a select-rank-case-stmt in a standard-conforming program;
if a processor does not support a higher rank that case is never
executed.

Some algorithms may want to allocate structures based on the 
maximum possible rank or corank, but there is no way to determine
this value programmatically. The proposed feature is "Add named
constants for a processor's maximum rank and corank to intrinsic
module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV." to satisfy this need.
