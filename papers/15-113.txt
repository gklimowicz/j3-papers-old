In UTI 011, the Editor quite reasonably remarks that effective arguments
are not addresses, and recommends that the offending paragraph be split
into two for the cases described.

The following is proposed as a resolution:

{rewrite the paragraph as two}

[454:1-6] replace paragraph 5 with the following

"In an invocation of an interoperable procedure whose Fortran interface
has an assumed-shape or assumed-rank dummy argument with the CONTIGUOUS
attribute or the actual argument is described by a descriptor (15.4)
for such an array from Fortran or is a Fortran procedure,
the Fortran processor will handle the difference in contiguity.

In an invocation of an interoperable procedure whose Fortran interface
has an assumed-shape or assumed-rank dummy argument with the CONTIGUOUS
attribute or the actual argument is described by a descriptor (15.4)
for such an array from C or the procedure is a C procedure, the C code
within the procedure shall be prepared to handle the situation
of receiving a discontiguous argument."
