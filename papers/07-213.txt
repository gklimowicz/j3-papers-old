INTRODUCTION

Subclause 15.3.4 of 04-007 says "A Fortran type is interoperable with a C
struct type if the derived-type definition of the Fortran type specified
BIND(C) (4.5.2), the Fortran derived type and the C struct type have the
same number of components, and the components of the Fortran derived type
have types and type parameters that are interoperable with the types of
the corresponding components of the struct type.

QUESTIONS

Is a Fortran derived type for which BIND(C) is not specified
interoperable with any C struct type?

Does a Fortran derived type interoperate with a C struct type that has a
different number of components?

Does a Fortran derived type interoperate with a C struct type that
specifies the same components in a different order?

Does a Fortran derived type with a pointer or allocatable component that
has interoperable type and type parameters interoperate with any C struct
type?

ANSWERS:

None of these Fortran derived types are interoperable.

EDITS:

Replace "if" in the above quoted paragraph in subclause 15.3.4 by "if and
only if".

At the end of the third paragraph of subclause 15.3.4, the one that begins
"There is no Fortran type..." insert a new sentence "A Fortran derived
type that has a direct component with the POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attribute
does not interoperate with any C struct type."
