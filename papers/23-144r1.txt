**-008 "A definition must be able to replace its term in the text.
        The following cannot".

Partially Accepted. The items will be reworded when possible. Nearly all
of these are adjectives, and in general, whether the definition is an
adjectival clause or an adjectival phrase, nothing works as a simple
"drop-in" replacement: suitable (if obvious) modifications of the context
will always be needed.

3.41 contiguous,
    Change "having array elements in order that are not separated by other
            data objects, as specified in 8.5.7"
    to     "whose array elements, in order, are not separated by other data
            objects, as specified in 8.5.7".

3.42 contiguous
    Change
        "that the parts in order are not separated by other data objects"
    to  "whose parts, in order, are not separated by other data objects"

3.52, "has a valid value" -> "with a valid value"

3.53, "has a pointer association status of associated or disassociated
       (19.5.2.2)"
      -> "whose pointer association status is associated or disassociated
          (19.5.2.2)"

3.62, "has a pointer association status of disassociated"
    -> "whose pointer association status is disassociated"

Reject 3.74, - There is no better description.

Reject 3.93.1, 3.93.2 (but they are reworded by another comment).

3.150, "does not have a valid value" -> "without a valid value".

Reject 3.151 - using "without" here would be poor both technically,
grammatically, and stylistically.

3.154 "not having the SAVE attribute" -> "without the SAVE attribute".
