New Unresolved Technical Issues in 11-154:
------------------------------------------

TR15 - Wording issues with the description of the formal parameters to
       the CFI_setpointer function. Added by 11-144r3.

TR16 - Questions about the selection of the capabilities of the
       functions used to manipulate descriptors. Added by 11-144r3.

TR17 - Should restrictions on assumed-type variables be a constraint?
       Added by 11-146r1.

TR18 - Should restrictions on assumed-rank variables be a constraint?
       Added by 11-146r1.

TR19 - Assumed-rank is neither a scalar nor an array, so there are
       issues with the description of the RANK intrinsic, and general
       terminology issues with assumed-rank.  Added by 11-146r1.

TR20 - The combination of TYPE(*) and ALLOCATABLE was disallowed by
       11-111r2. However, the example in A.1.3 seems to rely on this
       being allowed.

Disposition of edits affecting N1838.pdf in papers passed at J3
meeting 194:


11-103r2 Near the end of the new A.2.1, change the "//" style comments
         in C to the "/* ... */ style for consistency with the other
         examples.  Otherwise, done.

11-104r1 (done) Added edit: [9:8-9] remove reference to CFI_bounds_t
                {edit overlooked in removing the bounds arrays}

                In edit for [15:24] changed "CFI+index" to "CFI_index"
                {typo in the edit in 11-104r1}

11-105r1 (done)

11-106r2 (done)

11-108r2 (done)

11-109r2 (done)

11-111r2 (done)

11-113r2 The edit for [9:30} does not include the "being described" of
         the current text in the text to be replaced. However, the
         replacement text ends with a full stop. This is
         inconsistent. I opted to delete the "being described" text at
         the end of the sentence.

         In the edit for [9:30], the replacement text begins "if an
         object corresponds", whereas the other member descriptions
         refer to "the object".  Changed "an" to "the". Also
         capitalized the initial "if" to parallel the base_addr text
         above, and added a comma after "otherwise"

         Otherwise, done.

11-115r1 (done)

11-116r1 (done)

11-117r2 (done)

11-118r2 (done)

11-119r2 (done)

11-120r2 (done)

11-121r3 (done) The text at [9:13-14] also omitted mention of assumed
         character length. Fixed that, using wording parallel to that
         used at the beginning of 5.2.6 Functions.

11-122r4 (done) Added the new section after the text added by
          11-103r2.

11-123r2 (done)

11-124r3 (done) This paper overlooked a needed edit to the description
          of the type member of the C descriptor.  It says, in part
          ([9:37-10:1] of N1838),

             "The identifier for interoperable structures has a
              different value from any of the identifiers for
              intrinsic types. An identifier is also provided to
              indicate that the type of the object is unknown. Its
              value is different from that of any other type
              identifier"

          The identifier for a structure was removed by this paper. It
          and the unknown case are now identified by
          CFI_type_other. Replaced the first two sentences of the
          above quotation with

              "An identifier is also provided to indicate that the
              type of the object is a struct type, or is unknown."


11-131r2 (done) The "Comment to J3" concerning alternate placement of
         the text was not included in the text.

	 In the beginning of the new A.1.1, moved the paragraph
         between the two list items to after the second list item, and
         changed "this" to "the" in the moved paragraph.

	 In A.1.2, the comment 
           "! assign values to x, y, z and initialize handle"
         appears to suggest that this is the effect of executing
         the subsequent lines. In fact, the executions of EXAMPLE_send
         do not do this.  Added an extra two lines following this comment:
           ":
            ! send values in x, y, and z using EXAMPLE_send"
         to avoid the confusion.
 
         Corresponding changes made to the "fat binding" example.

	 In A.1.3, replaced "CFI_type_unspecified" with
	 "CFI_type_other" to use the new macro name.  Similarly,
	 replace "CFI_type_struct" with "CFI_type_other" twice.

         In A.1.3, the 'this' argument is declared
	 type(*),allocatable.  This is not allowed, so the whole
	 section seems flawed.  Added UTI TR20.

         In the new A.1.4, para 3, in "and it is assumed an
         implementation exists", added "that" after "assumed".


11-132r2 Edit for [21:17+] collided with a similar edit in
         11-122r4. Left the one in 11-122r4 and did not do this one.

         In the edits, changed a "footnote" to inline
         text. {Traditional literary footnotes are not used in the
         standard.}

	 Omitted the first Comment to J3 since the issue is explicitly
	 addressed in new normative text. Omitted the final Comment to
	 J3 regarding interaction with OpenMP.

	 In the new "A.2.3 Example of creating an array slice in C",
	 in the first line of paragraph 4, in "access all data" insert
	 "the" after "all".

         Otherwise, done.


11-137r3 The edit at [9:30] not done since the affected text was
         deleted by 11-113r2.

         Similar to the edit for [11:3], changed the -2 to math mode
         at then end of the UBOUND section at [6:10].  Otherwise,
         done.

11-142r1 (done)

11-144r3 In the last paragraph of "5.2.6 Use of C descriptors" changed
         the first "pointer" to "pointed".

         In the third paragraph of "5.2.5.9 CFI_setpointer", added
         "data" before "pointer object".

	 The beginning of the description of "5.2.5.8 CFI_select_part"
	 is "CFI_component establishes ...". Clearly an oversight in
	 the paper, as the function was named CFI_component in earlier
	 drafts.  Replaced "CFI_component" with "CFI_select_part".


         [This paper also added UTI's TR15 and TR16.]
         Otherwise, done.

11-145r1 (done) 

11-146r1 Changed UTI TRnn+1 to UTI TR17; moved to Clause 2.
         Changed UTI TRnn+2 to UTI TR18; Moved to Clause 2.
	 Changed UTI TRnn+3 to UTI TR19; reworded.

	 In 6.9, revised the various subclause numbers to reflect new
	 subclauses added by other papers.

         Edited out the lines beginning ***J3COMMENT:
         
   	 Added reference to Clause 6 in Paragraph 6 of the
   	 Introduction.

         Otherwise, done. 

11-147   (done)

11-148   (done)

11-149   (done) {The edit is actually to the third sentence, not the
                 second. The line cited, 4, is correct.}

Other changes:
-------------

Replaced the boiler plate text at the beginning of the "Normative
references" section with that mandated by the ISO rules.

Added angle brackets around "dummy variable" in 1.3.1 and 1.3.2
(definitions of terms "assumed-rank object" and "assumed-type
object"). The change makes these consistent with the corresponding
edits in Clause 6.

In 2.2, first sentence, added "<array-spec>" after "R515" to parallel
the corresponding statement in 2.1.

In 5.2.1, first sentence, added "the macro CFI_CDESC_T," to the list
of things defined in ISO_Fortran_binding.h.  An update to this
paragraph was overlooked when that macro was added.

Adjusted various (cosmetic only) spacing and line-wrap issues in the
document.
