Subject: The INTENT attribute and construct association

At [161:18-19] of the FCD, the following sentence appears:
    The associating entity has the ASYNCHRONOUS, INTENT, TARGET, or
    VOLATILE attribute if and only if the selector is a variable and
    has the attribute.

The INTENT attribute should not be listed here.  If the selector is
a pointer with INTENT(IN), then the associating entity, which is not
a pointer, would also have the INTENT(IN) attribute.  This clearly
prohibits assigning a value to that associating entity, even though
it would be legal to assign a value to the selector.

This case already seems to be covered by [161:22-23] anyway:
    If the selector (8.1.4.1) is not permitted to appear in a 
    variable definition context (16.5.7) or is an array with a 
    vector subscript, the associate name shall not appear in a
    variable definition context.

The case of an INTENT(OUT) dummy that has not yet been defined is 
covered by the restrictions on referencing an undefined variable.

Every interesting case for selectors with the INTENT attribute is
taken care of without the restriction at [161:18-19], and that 
restriction is incorrect in some cases.


Proposed Edits:
---------------
[161:19] Remove "INTENT,".
