Here are some edits arising from consideration of 16-176.

Edits to J3/16-007r1
-------------------

[207:25] In 8.6.10 LOCK and UNLOCK statements, para 5, add at the
end of first sentence ", and also through image failures".

[337:24+] In 13.6 Collective subroutines, after para 3 add
"NOTE
Although the calculations performed by a collective subroutine have
some internal synchronizations, a reference to a collective subroutine
is not an image control statement."

[364:22] In 13.9.50 CO_SUM(A [, RESULT_IMAGE, STAT, ERRMSG]),
argument A, end of para 1, change "corresponding." to
"corresponding references."

[376:19-23] In In 13.9.77 FAILED_IMAGES([TEAM, KIND]), para 5
(Result Value), replace sentence 2 by
"If the executing image has, in the specified team or a team that has
the specified team as an ancestor, previously executed an image control
statement whose STAT= specifier was assigned the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV,
at least one of the images participating in that image control statement
shall be known to have failed. If the executing image has, in the
specified team or a team that has the specified team as an ancestor,
previously invoked a collective subroutine whose STAT argument was
assigned the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, at least one of the images
participating in that collective invocation shall be known to have
failed."
[The edit is essentially to add "in the specified team or a team that
has the specified team as an ancestor" to both cases, but this makes
a long sentence even longer so we have split it in two.]

[386:17] In 13.9.97 IMAGE_INDEX (COARRAY, SUB) ..., para 3, COARRAY
argument, penultimate sentence change "the that" to "that".

[424:22] In 13.9.183 STOPPED_IMAGES([TEAM, KIND]), para 5
(Result Value), sentence 1, change "have are" to "are".

[424:24-27] In 13.9.183 STOPPED_IMAGES([TEAM, KIND]), para 5
(Result Value), replace sentence 2 by
"If the executing image has, in the specified team or a team that has
the specified team as an ancestor, previously executed an image control
statement whose STAT= specifier was assigned the value
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV,
at least one of the images participating in that image control statement
shall be known to have stopped. If the executing image has, in the
specified team or a team that has the specified team as an ancestor,
previously invoked a collective subroutine whose STAT argument was
assigned the value STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, at least one of the images
participating in that collective invocation shall be known to have
stopped."
[The edit is essentially to add "in the specified team or a team that
has the specified team as an ancestor" to both cases, but this makes
a long sentence even longer so we have split it in two. We have also
taken the opportunity to use the term "stopped".]

[431:14] In 13.9.197 UCOBOUND (COARRAY [, DIM, KIND]), para 5
(Result Value), sentence 1, change "number of in the team" to
"number of images in the team".

[437:17] In 13.10.2.26 STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, end of para 1, after
"atomic" add "subroutine".

[437:18-21] In 13.10.2.26 STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, delete para 2.
[see 16-208r2].

[437:31] In 13.10.2.29 STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, para 1, change
"requires synchronization with" to "involves".
