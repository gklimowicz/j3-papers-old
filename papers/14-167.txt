Subject: Delete STAT from EVENT WAIT
Date: 2014 June 06
References: N2007, N2013

Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~

In my vote in N2013 I complained about EVENT WAIT potentially hanging
forever if image failure occurs. (I consider a stopped image that
has not issued a needed EVENT POST a programming error).
This was based on the expectation that if a STAT= is specified, the
statement should return with e.g., STAT_FAILED_IMAGE if an image has
failed. However, the latter does not make sense because there are
many situations where the EVENT WAIT will complete successfully
regardless that an image has failed. Therefore it is suggested to
instead delete the sync-stat specification from EVENT WAIT. An
application designed for safety against image failure needs to use
EVENT_QUERY and maybe extra EVENT POST statements to assure that no
hangs can happen in this context.

EDITS to N2007:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[16:5] Delete "or sync-stat"

[16:11] Replace "or an error condition occurs, and" by ","

[16:12] Delete "if no error condition occurs,"

[16:16+] At the end of NOTE 6.3, add

"Furthermore, because the processor cannot know which image will
 issue a matching EVENT POST, there is no facility for continuing
 execution if an image failure occurs.
 It is the programmer's responsibility to avoid hangs by appropriate
 use of the EVENT_QUERY intrinsic, of methods for diagnosing
 image failure, and possibly execution of additional EVENT POST
 statements."

[33:17], [33:26], [33:31], [33:34] Delete "EVENT WAIT,", four times.

FURTHER COMMENTS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1) Discussion on the mailing list showed that it may be desirable to
    retain the STAT variable in order to be able to diagnose specific
    error conditions, including deadlocks. If this is decided, some
    of the above edits fall away and the NOTE text must be changed.
(2) There is some interaction of the above edits with 14-148r1 if
    the suggestions in that paper are accepted.
