1. Introduction

This paper handles the problems raised in 08-199r1 and 08-267.  The
analysis was similar to that in paper 08-301r1.  We have chosen to make a
similar limitation; basically, a whole polymorphic subobject of a coindexed
object is only allowed in certain situations; this reduces the
implementation cost.

The edit supplied subsumes the second edit in 08-301r1.


2. Edits:

[117:6.4.2 C616+] Insert new constraint

  "C616a (R611) Except as an actual argument to an intrinsic inquiry
         function or as the <designator> in a type parameter inquiry, a
         <data-ref> shall not be a polymorphic subobject of a coindexed
         object and shall not have a polymorphic allocatable subcomponent."
