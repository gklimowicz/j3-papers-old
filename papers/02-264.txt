[124:17] Change 'x_2 match those of d_2'
         to 'd_2 match the corresponding type parameters of x_2'.
{x_2 may be an extension of d_2.}

[124:36] Change 'x_1 and x_2 match those of d_1 and d_2' to
   'd_1 and d_2 match the corresponding type parameters of x_1 and x_2'.

[128:24-25]
No.  Current text is ok, suggested replacement is misleading.

[141:18] Append "<variable> shall not be polymorphic, and".
[141:21-25] Replace with
  "(3) The declared types of <variable> and <expr> shall conform as specified
   in Table 7.8."
{NEW: Existing text is incorrect gobbledygook.  Correct it.}
{TECHNICAL CHANGE: It is ok for the <expr> to refer to something bigger - it
just copies the common components in that case.}

[143:13-14] Swap "<variable>" and "<expr>" and change "to" to "from".
{Ditto.}

[144:18] Change 'x_1 and x_2 match those of d_1 and d_2' to
   'd_1 and d_2 match the corresponding type parameters of x_1 and x_2'.

[163:10] After 'causes' add 'execution of its <associate-stmt> followed by'.
{This is not strictly necessary, but is helpful clarification.}

[164:3] Before "," insert "(16.3, 16.4.1.5)".
{NEW: Forward reference the text which describes construct association fully.}

[164:4] Delete "(8.1.4)".
{NEW: Back reference to the immediately preceding 3rd-level subclause is
unnecessary and unhelpful.  The needed references are the ones to clause 16,
inserted above.}

[164:11+] (TECHNICAL CHANGE). Replace the note by
  "C810a (R822) If <selector> is not a named variable, <associate-name> =>
         shall appear."
{As the note previously said, this particular construction (omitting the
associate name when the selector is not a simple name) is almost completely
useless.  In addition, the current text on page 165 does not work and making it
work would make it very complicated.}
