I believe these are all purely typo's in Clause 13 and have
no technical merit.

339:note 13.1 Move to be after 339:14 (However, I believe
the first two lines each have an error, a
separate paper will propose edits)

362:12 There is an unfortunate line break after CALL CO_.
It's a visual problem because the next line starts
with ALL(MASK, RESULT) which is a fine Fortran
reference. There are many of these in the examples.
Is it possible for the editor to do something magical
with CO_ ?

365:4+6 lines Another unfortunate CO_ line break.

371:23+ Delete the first "or "

379:12-17 Outdent this paragraph so that it looks similar to
e. g. MINLOC at 404:36

385:5 There's an extra comma before the "[, MASK = MASK]"
Also pm 386:14, 391:4

393:25 Second "of" should be "or"

399:41 Needs a space before the last "MAX"

429:29 Indentation looks wrong to me, maybe it's 430:1-2

430:8 Delete "(optional)". We don't do this for things when
there is explicit syntax, see e.g. SUM on 427.

438:13-14 Move this section to after 435:3. It's unreasonable to
have the two sections that say nothing be so fat apart.
Or better, delete these two almost empty sections and move
their two sentences to after 434:32
