Discussion of Issue 34 (page 197)

Yes, a non-co-array with the target attribute may be referenced or
defined by another image if it is associated with a pointer component
of a co-array. Its location need not be in symmetric memory, but it
must be at least indirectly accessible.

On the notation, our preference is option (1) for segments and option
(2) for notify/query. These are the least cluttered. The arrows in (1)
are confusing.
