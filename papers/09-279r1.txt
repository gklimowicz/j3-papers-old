To: J3
From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Editorial changes
Date: Sometime


1. TOC problems to be fixed, somehow
------------------------------------

The clause numbers should be in the LHS PDF toc.

LHS PDF toc is missing the frontmatter.

Main TOC is also missing the frontmatter.

LHS PDF toc should have "Annex A (inf) proc depend",
not "Annex (inf) proc depend".

NB: The C standard gets all of these right.

There are no "Edits" for these, since these are not particular to pages in
the standard, but they need to be fixed nonetheless.


2. Changes not made
-------------------

[25:43] "outmoded"; this is being used informally in its normal English
sense, and does not need modification.

There are many terminological infelicities with "IEEE".  These are being
deferred to another paper.


3. Things that still need checking
----------------------------------

According to ISO Secretariat, the "normative references" is supposed to be
limited to things that appear in requirements (i.e. using "shall").  I
don't agree that that is what "indispensible" means (the ISO Directives),
and have not really checked that we do that at least once for every
normative reference.


4. Edits to 09-007r2
--------------------

[xii Foreword,p5] "ISO/IEC/JTC1" -> "ISO/IEC JTC 1", "SC22" -> "SC 22".
{ISO Secretariat: missing spaces.}

[xii Foreword,p6] "fifth"->"third", "fourth"->"second".
{ISO Secretariat: factual inaccuracy.}

[same location] "It also ... 19767:2004." ->
  "It also incorporates the Technical Corrigenda ISO/IEC
   1539-1:2004/Cor.1:2006, ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004/Cor.2:2007, ISO/IEC
   1539-1:2004/Cor.3:2008, and ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004/Cor.4:2009, and the
   Technical Report ISO/IEC TR 19767:2005.".
{ISO Secretariat: dates wrong, list incomplete.}

[xii Foreword,p10] "Compilation"->"compilation".
{ISO Secretariat: incorrect capitalisation.}

[xiii Introduction, subheading] Delete "International ... Fortran".
{ISO Secretariat: unnecessary subheading.}

[1:4] "Base Language"->"Base language".
{ISO Secretariat: incorrect capitalisation.}

[1:7-16] Replace entire paragraph 1 of 1.1 Scope with
  "This part of ISO/IEC 1539 specifies the form and establishes the
   interpretation of programs expressed in the base Fortran language^*1."
and footnote
  "*1: This part of ISO/IEC 1539 is intended to promote the portability,
       reliability, maintainability, and efficient use of Fortran programs
       on a variety of computing systems."
{ISO Secretariat: material inappropriate for scope.}

[2:2-3] "this part of ISO/IEC 1539"->"document",
        "referenced standard"->"referenced document".
{ISO Secretariat: clarification of guidelines.}

[2:5] After "1991" insert "(International Reference Version)".
{ISO Secretariat: clarify which 646 we use.}

[2:6-7] Delete reference to ISO 8601.
{ISO Secretariat: only reference documents used in requirements.}

[2:8] Delete "Information technology --" in C std ref.
{ISO Secretariat: incorrect name.}

[2:10] "IEC 60559 (1989-01)"->"IEC 60559:1989".
{Use correct format for designation.}

[2:11-15] Delete.
{ISO Secretariat: use correct references throughout.}

[global] "IEEE International Standard"->"\IEEEstd{}",
  with macro "\newcommand\IEEEstd{IEC 60559:1989}".
{ISO Secretariat: use correct references throughout.}

[global] "C International Standard"->"\Cstd{}",
  with macro "\newcommand\Cstd{ISO/IEC 9899:1999}".

[94:20] "at entry" -> "on entry".
{Inconsistent wording.}

[96:20] "at entry" -> "on entry".
{Inconsistent wording.}

[150:40] "C_SIZEOFfrom"->"C_SIZEOF from"
{Typo.}

[219:6+] Insert subclause heading "9.6.4.1 General".
{Fix nonconformance to ISO directives.}

[325:0+17] "forthis" -> "for this".
{Typo.}

[332:19] "tragets" -> "targets".
{Typo.}

[343:3+2-3] In Note 13.9, replace first "8601:1988" with "8601:2004",
            and replace the whole second sentence by
  "UTC is established by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
   (BIPM, i.e. Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) and the
   International Earth Rotation Service (IERS)."
{I see no harm, and only good, in noting that DATE_AND_TIME is compatible
 with 8601; that is, after all, why we defined it like that.  The new
 wording for the second sentence is taken verbatim from 8601:2004.}

[403:4] "exceptions and IEEE arithmetic" ->
        "the facilities defined by IEC 60559\*1"
  with footnote
    "*1: Because \IEEEstd{} was originally IEEE 754-1985, \textit{Standard
         for binary floating-point arithmetic}, and is widely known by this
         name, we refer to the arithmetic, exceptions, and other facilities
         defined by this standard as IEEE arithmetic, etc.."
{ISO Secretariat: Footnote IEEE 754 on the first occurrence of 60559.
 Actually, this is not the first occurrence, but it is the most obvious and
 useful one to footnote.  Also, improve statement of what these modules are
 doing.}

[465:3] Change Annex B title to "Deleted and obsolescent features".
{"Decremental" is not particularly informative.}

[587] Delete "Annex E (Informative)".
{ISO Secretariat: The Index is not a numbered annex.}

[global] Turn off line numbers.
{ISO Secretariat: published standards do not include line numbers.}
