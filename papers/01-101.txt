This paper describes the changes in J3/01-007 relative to the
previous f2k draft, J3/00-007R3.  All page/line references are to
J3/00-007R3 unless otherwise noted.

Ths change bars in 01-007 are relative to 00-007R2.  (Sorry; they
should be relative to 00-007r3, but I apparently forgot to clear
them before starting the new edits.)

This includes edits from papers (all 00-)

misc edits not in papers

  [370:14] "function" -> "subroutine".

paper 00-302, with the following changes

  I still think the second edit reads pretty badly, but that's
  what we passed, so that's how I entered it.

  In the note, I changed "prevents attempting to create" to
  "avoids the creation of".  This doesn't prevent you from
  attempting anything - it just says your attempt won't succeed.

  I still think it unhelpful to talk about activation records
  without even a vague definition of the term, but that comment
  elicited no support on the floor, so I've entered it as passed.

paper 00-303, with the following changes

  Also deleted "the" from [72:1].

paper 00-311r2, with the following changes

  Kept only one of the "the"s in "the the" (twice).

  Deleted "is selected" on [350:43].  Paper 311r1 had a
  replacement of this with a new sentence.  I requested this edit
  be deleted for the r2, but my request was sloppy and was only
  intended to avoid the addition of the new sentence.  The "is
  selected" still needs to go.

paper 00-312r2, with the following changes

  Also changed "Objects"->"Entities" in the title for 4.5.12 so
  that the title agrees with the content.

  Added a comma before the insertion at [121:37].

paper 00-313r3, with the following changes

  [280:22] Fixed so edit didn't leave an incomplete sentence.

  [287:44], [312:39] Didn't do this one (for ISHFT).  In this
  case "logical shift" is the correct, widely used, technical
  term and distinguishes this from an arithmetic shift.  I
  disagree that there is any danger here of confusion with
  logical variables - anyway not enough to take out the accepted
  technical term for this.  (What would a logical variable shift
  be?)  I can see confusions in things like "logical or" and the
  others, but not here.  There is much more danger here in not
  using the standard term for this operation.  If people insist,
  of course, I'll do the change, but I think this one a bad idea
  on closer inspection.

paper 00-318r1 as is

paper 00-320r2, with the following changes

  [41:33+] Since this added the same 2 xrefs as the constraint 2
  below, deleted them from that constraint.  Xrefs are pretty
  inconsistent throughout the document.  Some places too sparse.
  But other places too redundant.  We don't really need multiple
  xrefs of the same things in close sucession; it's just
  distracting.

  Added a missing comma after one of the dtv-type-specs.

  Two typos later pointed out by Van in the edit at 350:35-43.
  Deleted the "if" in the 4th item and changed the last comma in
  the 5th to a period.

paper 00-323r3, with the following changes

  I'm still puzzled about why a single paper uses two different
  ways of talking about the same thing ("initial mode" vs
  "initial value of a mode"), but at least this is better than
  three.  I've spent enough time on that aspect of this paper;
  entered as is in the paper.

  [172:25+] Combined this with (11) instead of adding a new item.

  [173:18+] "unit" -> "connection" and "on that unit" -> "for
  that connection".  The modes are associated with the connection
  - not the unit.  The paper even says so repeatedly in later
  edits where it talks about the modes for connections.  C.6.5
  talks about some of these things as connection properties, etc.
  Hmm.  I see that some of the existing text is inconsistent
  about that.  Oh well.  Omitted comma.

  [177:22-28] "sets" -> "specifies".  The specifier doesn't set
  anything; it just specifies it.  See similar wording in other
  subsections here.  Similar changes in [177:32] and [178:17+].

  [178:17+] Put PROCESSOR_DEFINED last instead or first in the
  list.  Likewise put S last instead of first (so that it still
  corresponds).  Same 2 changes in 9.5.1.14.  And also list S
  last in 10.7.4 for consistency (it is already described last,
  although listed first).  Likewise in R1015.

  [178:17+] For now, "file connected" -> "file being connected"
  so that at least it is like other sections here.  Probably want
  to come back later and fix all these...they should say things
  like "for a connection...".  Its for the connection, not the
  file and not the unit.

  [180:30+] "An" -> "A"

  [181:13] Added a comma.

  [184:16+] I don't really see anything wrong with "It specifies"
  (the antecedant of "It" being <scalar-default-char-expr>).  But
  that's not the phrasing used in any of the other specifiers
  here.  Since the title of the paper says "regularize", I'd
  think it best to make a point of using the same phrasing for
  the same thing unless there was an actual reason for a
  difference.  Looks like this wording was almost copied from
  that for decimal= or round= (which seems fine), but with minor
  random wording changes added, which doesn't seem so fine.  If
  the revised words are deemed better, then they ought to be used
  in the existing sections also.  The revised words mostly just
  look trivially diferent, neither better nor worse.  I
  regularized the words by using the same ones as for decimal=
  and round=.  Thus "It specifies" -> "The xxx= specifier
  specifies", "the initial value of the xxx mode" -> "the initial
  xxx mode", reversed order of internal/preconnected phrases (the
  articles avoid misparsing).  (4 times).

  In the other direction, the new wording about most recently is
  definitely better, so I copied it to the decimal= and round=
  sections; I've no idea why the paper didn't.

  Also made the bit about most recent open refer to connection
  instead of the file in all 6 places.  We sometimes use file,
  sometimes unit, and sometimes connection.  In the name of
  regularization, I tried to consistently use connection, though
  I didn't go through the whole section to find all occurances.

  I deleted the xref after "opened with no xxx specifier" in all
  6 sections.  In every case, it is at least the 2nd occurance of
  the same section xref from the same paragraph; in some cases it
  is the third.  That doesn't seem helpful.

  Delete "one of" from SIGN=.  I dunno why it was the only one of
  the 6 to use those words in that context.

  "input" -> "output" for sign= mode.  (Was right one place;
  wrong another).

  The 4th sentence in 9.5.1.14 was an almost verbatim repeat of
  the 2nd with an inconsequential diference.  I assumed this must
  have been a mistake.  I put the sentence in only once.

  Since the bit about correspondence to SP, SS, and S edit
  descriptors is explicitly expressed in terms of order (with
  "respectively"), I moved that sentence up so that the
  "respectively" is nearer to the list it refers to rather than
  being separated by an unrelated discussion of how the initial
  mode is determined.

  [203:10-12] Left original "input/output" rather than making an
  incompatable change to "input".  There is no relationship
  between the allowability of a BLANK= inquiry and the ACTION=
  specifier of OPEN, which is the closest thing we have to a
  concept of a connection restricted to input.  Also reworded to
  refer to the connection instead of a file.

  Similar changes for delim, pad, sign.  Similarly changed the
  file bit to refer to the connection for round and decimal.

  Deleted "one of" from the inquire SIGN= also.  There was a
  strange consistency about the inconsistency here, both SIGN=
  being inconsistent in the same way, but I'm not sure where it
  arose from.  If there weren't so many other inconsistencies
  around, I might suspect I was missing something subtle.
  Later...say, I see round= previously did this also.  Made it
  consistent as well.

  [230:40-44] Added a comma.

  10.7.6 on BN and BZ says the same thing redundantly several
  times.  It says that BN and BZ affect the blank interpretation
  mode; then it says how blanks are handled with blank
  interpretation modes of null and zero; then it says how blanks
  are handled with bn and bz; then it says how BN and BZ affect
  the blank interpretation mode.  I left it as is, being a bit
  tired by now.

paper 00-326 as is

paper 00-327r1, with the following changes

  Only capitalized the first word of 14.6.5 heading.

  Used numbered list instead of bulleted one (just because that's
  what we almost always do and what there was already a Frame
  template for in this chapter).

  Minor rewording of the array part of the first bullet item.
  Mostly to use "become" instead of "has" to indicate a change
  of state.  Also minor reordering of the phrases in the process.

  "if an array" -> "if it is an array"

  "if defined" -> "if it is defined" (twice)

  "become that" -> "become the same as those" (twice).  For
  number agreement and because we use "the same as" for the other
  cases, so we should also here (and it seems better anyway).

  Reworded last clause of 2nd bullet because the antecedant of
  "its" was confusing.  So just spelled it out instead of using
  "its".

paper 00-338r2, with the following changes

  Add a comma at [353:18]

  Since linkage association is listed as a form of name
  association, its new section goes as a subsection of the name
  association section, and in the order listed.  So it becomes
  14.6.1.4 at [355:44+]

paper 00-339r2, with the following changes

  Add "; this is" before "because" in the note.  (Help parsing).

  Add "connected for stream access" in the note because the
  statement might be misconstrued to apply too broadly otherwise.

paper 00-340r1, with the following changes

  the first "or" -> ",".

paper 00-347r1, with the following changes

  Added a comma in the constraint.

  No "the" before <target>. (3 cases) This one is actually pretty
  important.  We have had substantial confusions in this section
  before.  There are two different things that should *not* be
  confused.  There is "the target", with an article and without
  italics.  That is what the pointer ends up pointing to.  And
  then there is "<target>", in italic and with no article.  That
  is part of the bnf.  The two are critically different.  For
  example, <target> may be a pointer, but the target never is.
  Please do not confuse the two.  This is one place where a "the"
  does matter.  There is only the "the" and the italics to
  distinguish the two cases.  Perhaps things would be less
  confusing if the bnf term used a word other than <target>, but
  that's the term it currently uses.

  Since one of the new sentences uses (and means) both "<target>"
  and "target", it is really important to avoid confusion or the
  sentence becomes incomprehensible.  (You'll have readers asking
  how the target can be a proper subset of itself).

  Some of the constraints start with "The <target>" to avoid
  starting a sentence with bnf, but don't just add the "the"
  arbitrarily.

  Likewise no "the" before some cases of "<pointer-object>",
  though there isn't such obvious potential for confusion here.

  While on the subject I deleted about a bazzillion (I lost
  count) similar cases of "the" before these 2 bnf terms in the
  para at [140:36-40].  (Perhaps that's where you copied the
  style from).

  [139:17] add "for <pointer-object>" after 2 cases of "If an
  <upper-bound> is specified".  An upper-bound may be specified
  for variable (to point to an array slice), but I seriously
  doubt you intend these conditions to apply to that case - it
  would break huge amounts of existing code.

  I came awful close to adding an unresolved issue for the last
  sentence of the para added at [140:11+].  I even wrote one up,
  but then deleted it because I guess the sentence might be ok.
  Still, someone else might want to read it critically to decide
  whether it isn't too self-referential.  I found myself getting
  pretty confused about precisely what this was saying.  It kept
  sounding like the target was being defined in terms of itself.
  I finally concluded that perhaps it was ok....but I still find
  that it reads a bit strangely.

paper 00-351, with the following changes

  Added a comma in the first edit.

  In the new glossary entry, consistently use "in" instead of
  "by", just like in several of the other edits.

paper 00-352, with the following changes

  The changes in c13 weren't really quite as "the same" as
  advertised.

  I used the correct heading syntax for the cases where there
  were already other optional arguments.  (We put all optional
  arguments in a single set of square brackets in such cases).
  Indeed, LEN was in a distinct minority here; it was closer to
  the exception than the rule.

  And did not change "Argument" to "Arguments" where it was
  already that way.  (I rather doubt it was intended to end up as
  "Argumentss").

  When we change "Argument" to "Arguments" we also go to a
  different paragraph style, putting the first argument in a
  separate para instead of on the same line as the heading.  (One
  could perhaps argue that consistency between the singular and
  plural forms might have been a good idea...but that's not the
  way the document currently is).

  Changed both forms of MAXLOC and MINLOC.  I assume that was the
  intent.  That is a technical question rather than an editorial
  one...even though it's a technical question with what I assume
  to be an obvious answer.

  On a matter that is editorial, I omitted 2 blanks in the MAXLOC
  and MINLOC headers.  Stylistically, the blanks belonged there,
  but I didn't want to try to deal with a header that no longer
  fit on one line (which it didn't).

  I replaced only the first sentence (rather than the whole line
  or para) of most of the "result charactersitics" sections.  And
  changed "It" to "The result" in the second sentences because
  the referent for "It" was no longer clear.  Again, LEN was in a
  distinct minority here.  Hmm.  An now that I notice it, LEN was
  done wrong.  The edit omittted the scalar part.  For LEN, that
  is important.  I guess I better actually study each one of
  these cases, as it is obvious that the author did *NOT*.  SIZE
  also edited out the scalar bit; transformationals are different
  from elementals; the difference can be important.  I rewrote
  the one for SHAPE because the former first sentences mixed some
  things that are replaced with some that weren't.  Not that it
  was hard to rewrite, but it just makes me disbelieve that
  anyone other than me actually looked at each of these edits.
  My acceptance of "do the same thing in a lot of places" kind of
  edits is conditional on someone else having at least done a
  token check that "the same thing" is the appropriate edit.
  When such a token check so obviously has not been done,
  credibility about such things in the future suffers.  Was it
  possible to read all these "result characteristics" clauses
  without noticing that they differed - sometimes in
  substantitative ways?

paper 00-355, with the following changes

  I normally avoid beginning sentences with bnf, even adding
  otherwise superfluous articles if needed.  But I see there is
  plenty of precedent for the exact wording used in the new
  constraints here, so I'll leave them as is for consistency,
  rather than "fix up" all the existing cases.

  Similarly, "in the module" would be better as "of the module"
  when modifying "public entity", but it's already used
  incorrectly about as often as it's used correctly (if not more
  so), including in a bunch of cases right in this area, so I'll
  enter it as is.
