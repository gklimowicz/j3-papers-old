To: J3                                                     J3/22-131
From: Brian Friesen
Subject: Desired meeting format for J3 meeting #227
Date: 2022-February-28

ISO currently requires all meetings to be conducted virtually until April
30, 2022, with no guidance at this time regarding meeting format after that
date.  INCITS generally follows ISO guidance. It is expected that future
meetings will continue to be allowed the option of being held virtually,
even if in-person meetings are permitted at some point.

Since J3 meeting #227 will be held jointly with WG5, J3 should decide what
meeting format it would like to have for #227, subject to
as-yet-unannounced guidance from ISO and/or INCITS regarding meeting format
after April 30.
