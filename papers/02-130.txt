Subj:  J3 reconsideration of F95 Interp JP-17

At J3 meeting #159, J3 voted to reconsider the answer given for F95
interp JP-17 {see paper J3/01-398}.  JP-17 failed the WG5 ballot {see
WG5/N1470}.  This is what failed:

    QUESTION:
        Is the following NAMELIST statement standard conforming?

          NAMELIST /NLIST/A,B,A

    ANSWER: No.

    EDITS:

    [66:14]  Add new sentence at the end of the line:
             "A namelist group object shall not appear more than once
              in a single namelist group."

The answer below straw voted by J3 meeting #159 is "Yes, it is
standard conforming".

NUMBER: JP-17
TITLE: Multiple occurrence of namelist group object in namelist group
KEYWORDS: NAMELIST
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

JP-17)

  5.4 3rd paragraph after R545 and constraints states that:

  "A namelist group object may be a member of more than one
   namelist group."

  Can a namelist group object occur more than once in one
  namelist group?

  Is the following NAMELIST statement standard conforming?

        NAMELIST /NLIST/A,B,A

ANSWER: Yes.

DISCUSSION:

  Sections 5.4 "NAMELIST Statement" and 10.9 "Namelist Formatting"
  in Fortran 95 do not disallow multiple occurrences of a namelist
  group object in a namelist group.  This is also true in Fortran 90.
  Therefore the multiple occurrences are standard conforming.

EDITS:  None.
