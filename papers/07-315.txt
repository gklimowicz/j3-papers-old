Discussion

Making the collectives elemental would be a technical change with
these effects:

   1. There would have to be a restriction that TEAM be scalar.

   2. Either there would have to be a restriction that the first
      argument be an array when the second argument is an array or the
      functionality of broadcasting to an array argument would need to
      be added.

   3. It would exclude a future extension for a complete reduction to
      be performed when the input argument is an array and the output
      argument is a scalar.

We are therefore not proposing this change.

It is the elemental nature of the collectives that forces the
CO_MAXLOC and CO_MINLOC to return image indices rather than an array
of subscripts.

Yes, we could add a CO_DIM argument, but a call with such an argument
would involve a number of independent sub-teams and more
synchronization than necessary. The effect is available by declaring
another IMAGE_TEAM variable for the sub-team on each
image. Futhermore, adding a CO_DIM argument represents an increase in
the size of the co-array feature at a time when there is some
sentiment within WG5 that the co-array feature should be reduced.
