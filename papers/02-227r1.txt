Subject:  Sqrt(complex)

In comp.lang.fortran, James Giles complained that the specified
return value for complex sqrt for certain values was wrong.
Subsequent discussion on the mailing list clarified the issue.
The edit below uses the Last Word from the mailing list discussion.

Later, Van further commented:
"In the last sentence of the edit for [347:20-21] I would be tempted
 to write "not be negative" instead of "be nonnegative."  Or, in the
 penultimate sentence, I would be tempted to write "be nonpositive"
 instead of "not be positive."  Otherwise, one wonders if there's a
 subtle reason for the non-parallel construction."

Edits:

347:20-21 Replace "When the ... to zero." with
"If the imaginary part of the argument is negative,
the imaginary part of the result shall not be positive.
Otherwise the imaginary part of the result
shall not be negative."
