NUMBER: F03/? (maybe 0140?)
TITLE: Type of nested construct entities.
KEYWORDS: ASSOCIATE, DATA, FORALL, SELECT TYPE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the example:

  PROGRAM bad
    REAL x
    INTEGER i,y(10)
    ASSOCIATE (x=>i)                 ! B
      DATA (y(x),x=1,10)/10*1/       ! A
      DO x=1,10                      ! B
        y(x) = SQRT(y(x))            ! B
      END DO                         ! B
      FORALL(x=1:10) y(x) = y(x)**2  ! C
    END ASSOCIATE                    ! B
    x = SUM(y)
  END PROGRAM

Is this program conforming?

That is:
  Within the ASSOCIATE construct, is X of type INTEGER?

  It certainly is in the statements marked with "! B".

  But according to 16.3 paragraph 2 [409:18-20], in the statement
  marked "! A", X has the type it has in the scoping unit, which would
  have to be REAL.

  And according to 16.3 paragraph 3 [409:25-27], in the statement
  marked "! C", X has the type it has in the scoping unit, which would
  have to be REAL.

  If X is type REAL for DATA and FORALL, the program would not be
  conforming, but it would be if X were of type INTEGER.

ANSWER:

Within the scope of a construct entity name, it was intended that a
data-implied-do index or a FORALL index name should have the type and
type parameters of the construct entity name.  Edits are provided to
clarify this.

EDITS:

[409:19] 16.3 Statement and construct entities, para 2, sentence 2,
  Before "scoping unit" insert "innermost executable construct or".
{Makes a difference for DATA in ASSOCIATE and SELECT TYPE only.}

[409:26] 16.3, paragraph 3, sentence 2,
  Before "scoping unit" insert "innermost executable construct or".
{Makes a difference for FORALL in ASSOCIATE and SELECT TYPE only.}
