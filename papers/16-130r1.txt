considered to be unnecessary, unimprovements, or uncorrect.

2. Edits to 16-007

[328:12+2] 13.4 Numeric models, NOTE 13.4,
  "Examples of these functions in 13.8"
  -> "Some of the function descriptions".
{No antecedant for "these functions".}

[334:SPACING] After "Spacing of model numbers" delete "(13.4)".
{Unnecessary reference.}

[367:36-40] 13.8.78 GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE, p3 Arguments,
            "is set to" -> "is assigned the value", four times.
{Incorrect terminology.}

[389:17] 13.8.129 MOVE_ALLOC, p4,
  Change "The allocation status of TO becomes unallocated if FROM is
          unallocated on entry to MOVE_ALLOC. Otherwise,"
  to     "On invocation of MOVE_ALLOC, if the allocation status of TO is
          allocated, it is deallocated.  If FROM is not the same variable
          as TO and has an allocation status of allocated on entry to
          MOVE_ALLOC,".
{Clarify sequence of events so that the effect of CALL MOVE_ALLOC(X,X) is
 more obvious.}

[397:19] 13.8.147 RANDOM_INIT,
         "in another image" -> "by another image".
{Wrong word.}

[400:29] 13.8.153 REDUCE, p5, Case (ii),

{More than one type now in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.}

[510:38+] Annex A,
          After bullet "how the sequences of atomic",
          move bullet "the value assigned to a STAT..."
          from [512:15-16] to here.

[511:4] After "the value assigned to a CMDSTAT, ERRMSG,"
        insert "EXITSTAT,".
{Missing processor dependency.}

[511:10+] After bullet "the value of command argument zero",
          insert new bullet
   "the order of command arguments (\ref{D13:GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT})".
{Missing processor dependency.}

[512:15-16] Bullet "the value assigned to a STAT...",
