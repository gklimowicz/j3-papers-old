                                                           J3/16-163r1
To: J3
From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Bad wording in clause 16
Date: 2016 February 10


1. The problem

The discussion of how pointer association interacts with MOVE_ALLOC in c16
talks about something "without the TARGET attribute [being] pointer
associated", when what it should say is "the argument TO does not have the
TARGET attribute".

2. Edits

[496:31] 16.5.2.5 Events that cause the association status of pointers to
         become undefined, p1, item (5),
  Change "an object without the TARGET attribute is pointer associated
          with the argument TO"
  to "the argument TO does not have the TARGET attribute".

This makes that item read:

[The association status of a pointer becomes undefined when]
  "(5) the allocation transfer procedure (13.8.129) is executed, the
       pointer is associated with the argument FROM, and the argument TO
       does not have the TARGET attribute,".

[505:20-21] 16.6.6 Events that cause variables to become undefined, (21),
  Change "where an object without the TARGET attribute is pointer
          associated with the argument TO"
  to "where the argument TO does not have the TARGET attribute".

This makes that item read:
  "(21) Execution of the allocation transfer procedure (13.7.125) where
        the argument TO does not have the TARGET attribute causes a
        variable of type C_PTR from the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING to
        become undefined if its value is the C address of any part of the
        argument FROM.".
