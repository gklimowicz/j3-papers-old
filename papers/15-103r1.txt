Subject:   Interpretation concerning name usage

If /INTERP decides this is too picayune to be processed as an
interpretation and published in a corrigendum, it can be (a) proposed
as a wart-removal work item, (b) corrected as an "editorial" matter,
or (c) ignored.

NUMBER: TBD
TITLE: Is a processor required to report only improper name usage?
KEYWORDS: names, labels, operators, assignment symbols, scoping
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is a conforming processor required to report improper usage of label
10?

  go to 10
  block
10  continue
  end block

Is a conforming processor required to report improper usage of the
operator symbol .op.?

  write ( *, * ) .op. 42
  block
    interface operator ( .op. )
      pure integer function F ( N )
        integer, intent(in) :: N
      end function F
    end interface
  end block

ANSWER:

1.5p2(6) says a processor conforms to this part of ISO/IEC 1539 if:
...

" (6) it contains the capability to detect and report the use within a
      submitted program of name usage not consistent with the scope
      rules for names, labels, operators, and assignment symbols in
      Clause 16;"

The label "10" is not a name, so a conforming processor is not
required to report this improper usage.  Further, branching into a
construct from outside it is prohibited in Clause 8, not clause 16.

The operator symbol .op. is not a name, so a conforming processor is
not required to report this improper usage.

It was intended that a conforming processor be required to report
these improper usages, and ones involving assignment symbols.

Edits are provided to correct this oversight.

EDITS:

[14-007r2:23:23-25 1.52(6)] Replace "name" with "identifier".  Replace
"Clause 16" with "Clauses 8 and 16".

ALTERNATIVE EDITS:

[14-007r2:23:24 1.52(6)] Remove ", labels, operators, and assignment
symbols".

Alternative edits for non-interp change:

[14-007r2:xv Introduction somwhere]

"o  A conforming processor is required to report improper identifier
    usage that does not conform to rules in Clauses 8 and 16, not
    simply improper name usage that does not conform to rules in
    Clause 16."

[14-007r2:23:23-25 1.52(6)] Replace "name" with "identifier".  Replace
"Clause 16" with "Clauses 8 and 16".

{This would make it irrelevant to constrain branching into a construct
from outwith it, as advocated in 14-242r1.}
