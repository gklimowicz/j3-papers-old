Subject: Guidelines for edit preparation

1. Introduction

These guidelines are intended for use in preparing edits whether for WG5
publication (Technical Reports and Corrigenda) or J3 internal work
(Interps, F2008 preparation).

Apart from the usual considerations for WG5 publication, the aim is to
(a) make reading edits easier,
(b) increase the chance of spotting an editorial mistake earlier, and
(c) decrease the chance of the editor making a mistake applying the edit.

2. Edits to specific subclauses of 007

2.1 The Introduction

F2008 new features that are significant enough to warrant mention in the
Introduction (currently on page xiii) should have an "edit" containing the
text for its list item.  For now, ignore the existing xiii in 04-007, as
the boilerplate will be rewritten later for F2008 (and the existing list
items will all be deleted).

2.2 The Compatibility subclause

Any feature which makes an incompatible change to the language should have an
"edit" containing the text for its list item in what will be a new 1.6.1
"Compatibility with Fortran 2003" subclause.

3. General rules

(1) Clearly identify the subclause of the standard to which the edit applies,
    e.g. "2.1 High level syntax".

(2) Clearly identify the paragraph within the subclause; for BNF and
    constraints, this should mention the Rule or Constraint number.  For BNF,
    it should also mention the name of the rule, e.g.
    "R213 <executable-construct>"

(3) For an insertion, give sufficient context prior to (or following) the
    new text to unambiguously place the edit in the paragraph (not just the
    line), and preferably the subclause.

    For changed text, give sufficient context surrounding the changed words
    to unambiguously place the edit similarly.

(4) When appending material to a paragraph, say "append" or even "append to
    same paragraph".  Similarly, when the material is to be a new paragraph,
    say "new paragraph".  The cryptic [20:21+] style of notation is not useful
    for WG5 publication, and even outside of that it is easy to misread.

(5) Give the [page:line] reference in the same way as we usually do.

3. Example

Here is an example:

   In "2.1 High level syntax", "R213 <executable-construct>":
   After "<<or>> <case-construct>", insert new production
     "<<or>> <critical-construct>" [10:54+]

I am not fussy about the wording, or the ordering, so long as the necessary
identification items are present.
