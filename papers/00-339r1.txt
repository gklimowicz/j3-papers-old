Subject: Issue 126

Fix some grammar and resolve issue 126.

Edits:

168:42 Change "visted ... remembered"
to "identified by the POS= specifier in INQUIRE"

168:43+ Add a note:
Note 9.7+
There may be some character positions in the file which do not correspond
to characters written because on some processors, a record marker may
be written to the file as a carriage-return/line-feed or other sequence.
The means of  determining a position in a file is via the POS= specifier
in an INQUIRE statement (9.8.1.16).

169:1-14 delete the issue
