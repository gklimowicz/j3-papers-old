Subject: Issues 42 & 43, teams for preconnected units
Reference: J3/06-007r1, J3/06-258


Discussion of issues 42 and 43 (page 220)

The intention is not to affect the behaviour on image 1 of preconnected
units and the units INPUT_UNIT, OUTPUT_UNIT, ERROR_UNIT, but to
limit their use on other images to simple output. The main mechanism
for parallel i/o is the direct-access file, connected through an
OPEN statement.

We agree that the present wording is overly restrictive, and that the
connect team for INPUT_UNIT should be image 1.

Edits to J3/06-007r1 in the last paragraph of 9.4.5.17 TEAM= specifier
in the OPEN statement:

[220:7] Remove "INPUT_UNIT," and the comma following OUTPUT_UNIT.

[220:9] Replace "an input/output statement" with "a data transfer
statement".

[220:10] Add a new sentence at the end of the paragraph: "The unit
identified by the value INPUT_UNIT in the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV has a connect team consisting of image 1."
