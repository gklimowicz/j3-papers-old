To: J3
From: Van Snyder & Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Comments on Clause 3
Date: 2016 October 10


1. Edits accepted (with modifications)

[5:6-8] 1.2 abstract interface
  Make this a sub-definition of "interface" [15:25+] 3.93 interface.
[13:23-26] 3.70 explicit interface
  Ditto.
[15-7-9] 3.89 implicit interface
  Ditto.

{Collect all the interface definitions together.  Note that another paper
 repairs the known-to-be-defective definition of "implicit interface".}

[18:29] 3.115.4 module procedure
  Change "procedure that is defined by" -> "procedure defined by",
  Append, ", or a procedure provided by an intrinsic module",
  hyperlinking term "intrinsic".

{Improve wording consistency with nearby definitions, and remove any
 inadvertent implication that intrinsic modules have to implement their
 procedures via module subprograms.}

[19:25] 3.123.2 function reference
  After ", or operator symbol"
  insert "for a defined operation,".

{State more precisely and more grammatically.}


2. Rejected edits

[10:34 3.47] Delete "object"  because this is not where one would expect
to find this definition {it reappears in the edit for [17:23+] below}.

[17:23+ 3.107+] Insert a definition
"3.107a <<object>>
data object" {as a link}
{This is where one would expect to find "object" if one were not looking
for "data object"}.

REJECTED: The terms and definitions are not an index, and are formatted
          correctly according to ISO rules.

[18:20+ 3.115.1] Insert a definition
"3.115.1a <<elemental procedure>>
see 3.67.4" {as a link}
{One might reasonably expect to find this in both places.  The first
(3.67) has several "elemental" definitions; the second (3.115} has
several "procedure" definitions.}

REJECTED: The terms and definitions are not an index, and are formatted
          correctly according to ISO rules.

[18:42 3.117] Replace the comma with a semicolon.  Replace "and" with ",
representations, or".

REJECTED: This is already formatted correctly according to ISO rules.

[22:27 3.146] Finalization and defined I/O are not operations.  Replace
"or by some operations on" with "finalization, or input/output defined
for".

REJECTED: Finalization and defined I/O are operations according to both
          the normal and computer science meanings of the words.

[25:22 3.157.2] After (either) "thereof" insert ", is not an associate
name".

REJECTED: An associate name is not a local entity of any scoping unit.

[Throughout clause 3] Perhaps use "in this document" or "by this
document" consistently; both are presently used.

REJECTED: This would appear to be correct as is.
