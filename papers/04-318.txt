1.1 Opening business - D. Nagle

        The meeting was called to order at 8:00 AM, Monday, May
        3, 2004, at the Las Vegas Emerald Suites by the chair, Dan
        Nagle.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair - D. Nagle

        Dan welcomes the WG5 members who were attending this J3
        meeting.  Processing of the draft Fortran 2003 Standard {F03}
        and the Enhanced Modules Technical Report {EM TR} will be done
        as WG5 not J3.  F95 interpretation handling will be done as
        J3.  J3 will also consider new tasks for future standards.

                unanimous consent {uc}

1.1.4 INCITS/OMC report (if any) - D. Nagle

        In a verbal/electronic report to INCITS, Dan said that J3 was
        getting F03 and the EM TR out on time.  We are starting to
        think about the next standard.  The annual report is in April.

        Craig Rasmussen expressed interest in being the J3 liaison to
        J11, the C++ committee.

        Next week, INCITS will send Dan the list of who has paid dues
        so we know who is and is not a member.

1.1.5 ISO/WG5 report - V. Snyder, IR

        The US TAG will have formal ballots to reaffirm parts 2
        {Varying String} and 3 {CoCo} at the TAG meeting

1.1.6 H2 Liaison report (if any) -

        No liaison.  The J11 liaison report will appear here.

1.1.7 IEEE 754 report (if any) - M. Ingrassia

        Nothing to report

1.1.8 Treasurer's report - M. North

        The current balance is $2772.94 + interest;  there are no
        outstanding bills

1.1.9 Beginning membership report - S. Whitlock

        Craig Rasmussen from Los Alamos National Laboratory is now
        a member.

        C. Dedo has lost membership because he missed 3 meetings in
        a row.

        M. van Waveren is present.  Because he has missed 2 of the
        last 3 meetings, his membership will still be in jeopardy at
        the end of this meeting

        K. Hirchert and B. Smith {alternate W. Brainerd} will lose
        membership for non-payment of INCITS dues.

        Co-arrays = 6
        Decimal arithmetic = 3
        IEEE 754 revised = 4
        KIND in environment = 6

    More examples:

        Typeless = 6
