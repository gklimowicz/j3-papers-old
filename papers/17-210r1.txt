Discussion:
-----------

Comment 30 in WG5/N2141 states:

R1113 allows a coarray association of the form
     CHANGE TEAM(t, b[:,:] => a)
This should be disallowed, it is intended that a <coarray-association>
should provide an explicit coshape declaration.

Response:
---------

A <coarray-spec> of [:,:] in a <codimension-decl> is valid only for an
allocatable coarray, as specified in "8.5.6.2 Allocatable
coarray". Additionally, "11.1.3.3 Other attributes of associate names"
states that "The associating entity does not have the ALLOCATABLE or
POINTER attributes".  Thus, the syntax the comment seeks to prohibit
is already disallowed.

Edit to 17-007r2:
