		Report I from subgroup Chapter 8 onwards

Paper N1539

Subgroup is of the opinion that there is no overriding
reason for this technical change at a moment when
no technical changes should be made.  The issue could
be reargued for the next standard.  The constants will
be superfluous then, but that's acceptable.  Moreover,
the objective set out in the first paragraph is not
achieved ("inquire about the size of any storage unit
defined by the standard").


Paper N1543

Part I. Simplify organization of 13.8.2.

OK with subgroup; editorial changes that are at the
discretion of J3.

Part II. Move the new functions.

Subgroup agrees with Craig Dedo (N1530); One can use
the functions without having need of the constants.
The module is necessary because Fortran doesn't have
intrinsic constants.  There's no overriding reason
to put the functions into the module.

Part III. Command line functions.

Subgroup agrees with Craig Dedo (N1530); same reason.

Part IV. Fixups.

OK with subgroup; editoral changes that are at the
discretion of J3. (Note 10.17 should talk about
"the intrinsic function NEW_LINE").


Paper N1530

Accepted as is (see subgroup's treatment of N1543).


Paper N1532

Subgroup recommends to require at least one character.

Subgroup recommends the following edits instead of the
ones given:

230:19 Replace "processor dependent number of nonblank
       characters" by "one or more alphanumeric characters
       (letters, digits and underscores)".
230:24 Delete "nonblank".
230:31 "nonblank" -> "alphanumeric".
