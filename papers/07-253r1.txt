Subject: UTI 118 (pp 28-29): Error list redundant

Discussion

The editor suggests that the list of ways that error termination can
occur be deleted since it duplicates text elsewhere in the
standard. We agree.  It is hard to ensure that the list is complete
and that every item is correct.  If an edit is made elsewhere, there
is a danger of overlooking the corresponding edit in this list.

Note that if this is adopted, no response to UTI 117 (paper 07-252) is
needed.

Edits to 07-007r2:

[28:19] In 2.4.5 Execution sequence, para. 6, append to the first line
"an ALL STOP statement is executed or an error condition occurs."

[28:20-33] In 2.4.5 Execution sequence, replace the remainder of
para. 6 with

"NOTE 2.11a 

As well as in the circumstances specified in later sections of this
International Standard, an error condition might occur by other means;
for example, the user might have placed a limit on execution time or
requested termination by typing a special character."
