Subject: Unresolved issue 253

Issue 253 (page 392) complains that the semantics of the C_LOC
function are unclear.  The semantics of applying the C_LOC
intrinsic to subobjects is clear from text in 16.2.4 and 16.2.5.

Edit: [391:32-33] change "a unary "&" operator," to
    applying the unary "&" operator to the object that interoperates
    with X,"

Edit: [392:1-17] delete unresolved issue 253
