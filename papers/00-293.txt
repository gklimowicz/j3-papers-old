The editor has reviewed the edits from wg5 in paper J3/00-261.  He
proposes to accept the edits for the following lines exactly as
specified in 00-261

  [xv:39], [7:9], [32:34], [41:17], [41:18-19], [43:22+],
  [55:11], [61:35], [78:4], [115:34], [115:42], [132:21],
  [137:36], [155:several], [156:18], [238:1-4], [247:13],
  [330:34], [344:35], [401:5+], [259:16], [400:25,27], [468]

The editor proposes to accept the edits for the folling lines
with revisions as noted here

  [103:7] Add a comma after <source-variable> in the edit.

  [115:43+] The edit is ok as is, but is confusingly presented in
  the text version. The entries for the two columns of the table
  are "in a <proc-binding> for which a <proc-interface-name> is
  specified" and "the interface specified by the <proc-binding>".
  
  [245:28-38] Add "of" after "is" in (2)(c) of the edit.
  Move the "or" from (3)(c) to (4) of the edit.

  [344:40] The edit proposed in 00-261 has multiple problems.  It
  differs in wording style from all the other bullets in the area;
  it fails to restrict itself to the particular name in question;
  and its section reference is has a transliteration typo.  Instead
  of that edit, make the following changes to [344:40]

    Add "explicit" before "EXTERNAL".
    Add "(5.1.2.10)" after "specification".

The remark about [459:1+] is pertinent but is not sufficiently
specific for the editor to act on.  The editor needs precise
specifications of exactly what edits are to be done.  In the case
of index entries, this includes the specific places for the index
references - not just directions that some term is missing from
the index (or even more so that some classes of terms are missing
from the index).  The editor agrees that the index is important,
but he does not have sufficient time to create the whole index
from general directives like this.

The remaining edits in 00-261 have been referred to data or jor.
