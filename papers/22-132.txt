To: J3                                                     J3/22-132
From: Tom Clune						   
Subject: WG23 Liaison Report
Date: 2022-February-28

WG23 Is the Programming Language Vulnerabilities within the ISO/IEC
Standardization Committee.  The goals are to identify common
vulnerabilities in the reprepsented language and provide guidance to
users on how to avoid/mitigate.


Addressing Fortran's vulnerabilities had reached a somewhat mature
point prior to the resignation of the former liaison and formall
restarted with a telecon on February 28th, with Tom Clune attending.


The draft Fortran document could use review by multiple members of J3,
and in particular we need support from someone more familiar with
Fortran concurrency than myself.  Current meetings are biweekly 10-12
Mondays ET, but could possibly be moved to accommodate additional
representatives.  Alternatively, we could possibly proceed by email
with just myself attending the telecons on behalf of Fortran.  The
total amount of work here is well bounded and should complete with
just a few iterations.
