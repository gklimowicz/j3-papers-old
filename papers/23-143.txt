**-061 says that we need to use Cambria, size 11, except withint NOTEs
which should be Cambria size 10, and code which should be Courier New.

Reject. We use more than three font-size combinations, our toolchain is
set up for the fonts that we use (not including Cambria), and the document
is typeset for those fonts. It would be a mammoth task to reset the whole
document to use only those three font-size combinations, and would
require a complete redesign of the handling and presentation of our
"obsolescent features".

The Working Group undertakes to do this work over the course of the next
revision (Fortran 202y). But for timely publication, this revision needs
to keep using the fonts that we are using now.
