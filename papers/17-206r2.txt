Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The definition of upper cobounds in the standard appears to be
distributed across multiple places.

The base definition is in 8.5.6 CODIMENSION attribute. There,
the last upper cobound is always excluded. This definition is
sufficient to establish the mapping between coindices and image
index in the current team (or, more generally with the rules
from 9.6, in any specified team).

In 16.9.197 UCOBOUND [439:10-11], this is extended by also
defining the final upper cobound, a run time property, since
obtaining it requires knowledge of the number of executing images.
This makes sense because UCOBOUND needs to be able to return
an array of size corank its argument, but is a bit confusing or
even incorrect when considering references to cobounds in other
places in the standard. It appears that everywhere except
in the definition of UCOBOUND, the first definition is
targeted.

Note that 9.6 para 4 constrains the program to use valid image
indices, implicitly constraining also the cosubscript in the
final codimension.

Edits are suggested to make a clearer distinction between the
two cases.

Edits to N2137:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[45:26-] Section 5.4.7 Coarray, add the following text to NOTE 5.10:
"A corank n coarray has n lower and n-1 upper cobounds (8.5.6).
 A value for the upper cobound of the final codimension can be
 obtained by the program through invoking the UCOBOUND intrinsic.
 This final upper cobound is otherwise
 not included when this document references the term ''cobounds''."

[438:36] Section 16.9.197 UCOBOUND replace
"Description: Upper cobound(s) of a coarray."
with
"Description: Upper cobound(s) of a coarray, including that for the
 final codimension."
