Discussion
----------

In the description of each collective in the TS, all the images of the
current team are mentioned, not the active images. It was not intended
that a collective subroutine be able to execute successfully with a
failed image in the current team. Edits are suggested to remove the
reference to "active images" from three of the collectives (bringing
them into line with the wording for CO_REDUCE and CO_SUM). The TS
incorrectly used the word "active" in the text for 13.6. Edits are
suggested to remove these, too.

We agree with the editor's rewording in 13.6, para. 7.


Edits to J3/16-007r1
-------------------

[337:12-16] In 13.6 Collective subroutines, replace para 1 and the first
sentence of para 2 by this new paragraph:
"A successful execution of a collective subroutine performs a
calculation on all the images of the current team and assigns a
computed value on one or all of them. If it is invoked by one image, it
shall be invoked by the same statement on all images of its current
team in segments that are not ordered with respect to each other;
corresponding references (invocations) participate in the same
collective computation."

[337:19] In 13.6 Collective subroutines, para 2, penultimate sentence,
delete "active".

[337:24] In 13.6 Collective subroutines, para 3, delete "active".

[338:4+] In 13.6 Collective subroutines, para 7, delete UTI 27.

[361:38] In 13.9.46 CO_BROADCAST, Argument A, delete "on all
active images in the current team".

[362:18] In 13.9.47 CO_MAX, Argument A, delete "on all
active images in the current team".

[362:41] In 13.9.48 CO_MIN, Argument A, delete "on all
active images in the current team".
