1. Introduction

Paper 14-175r3 has specs, syntax, and edits to implement UK-13.
However the edits were rejected by 14-239.

This paper contains revised edits.  There are no changes to the
specs or syntax.


2. Edits to 14-007r2

[xviii] Introduction: Add to the bullet "Input/output" the sentence
"An error condition occurs if unacceptable characters are presented
for logical or numeric editing during execution of a formatted input
statement."

[253:32-33] 10.7.2.2 Integer editing, p3,
            "In the input field"
            ->"In the standard form of the input field",
            "shall be" -> "is",
            append sentence
              "If the the input field does not have the standard form and
               is not acceptable to the processor, an error condition
               occurs.".
{This makes the whole paragraph read
  "In the standard form of the input field for the I edit descriptor, the
   character string is a signed-digit-string (R410), except for the
   interpretation of blanks.  If the the input field does not have the
   standard form and is not acceptable to the processor, an error condition
   occurs."}

[254:12] 10.7.2.3.2 F editing, p3,
         "The input field is" -> "The standard form of the input field is",
[254:40+] ditto, p7+, new paragraph
          "If the input field is not one of the standard form, and is not
           acceptable to the processor, an error condition occurs.".

[259:19-21] 10.7.2.4 B, O, and Z editing, p3,
            "In the input field"
            -> "In the standard form of the input field",
            "shall consist" -> "consists",
            append sentence
              "If the input field does not have the standard form, and is
               not acceptable to the processor, an error condition
               occurs.".

[260:4-6] 10.7.3 Logical editing, p2,
          "The input field" -> "The standard form of the input field",
          join p3 to p2,
          append sentence
            "If the input field does not have the standard form, and is not
             acceptable to the processor, an error condition occurs.".

[266:3] 10.10.3 List-directed input, p1,
        "The form" -> "If the form",
        "shall be acceptable" -> "is not acceptable",
        after "effective item in the list"
        insert ", an error condition occurs".
{This makes the sentence read
  "If the form of the input value is not acceptable to the processor for
   the type of the next effective item in the list, an error condition
   occurs."}

[270:24] 10.11.3.2 Namelist input processing, p2,
         Append
           "Except as noted elsewhere in this subclause, if an input value
            is not acceptable to the processor for the type of the list
            item in the corresponding position in the expanded sequence, an
            error condition occurs."
