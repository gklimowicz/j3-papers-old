Subject:   Pointer subobjects of type LOCK_TYPE

1. Introduction
===============

Paper 14-165 deletes the constraint that this paper advocates to revise.

If a variable has a pointer subobject of type LOCK_TYPE, there's no harm
in it appearing in a variable definition context.

If a variable has a pointer subobject of type EVENT_TYPE, there's no
harm in it appearing in a variable definition context.

A designator with a final <part-ref> that has the POINTER attribute does
not designate a subobject in a variable definition context, but if
there's no designator for that subcomponent, but rather only for the
base object (the subject of C1304), 6.4.2p5 doesn't apply.
