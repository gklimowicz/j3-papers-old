TITLE: Commas in complex namelist output
KEYWORDS: Namelist, complex formatting, comma, semicolon
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: ?

QUESTION:

The 7th paragraph in 10.9.2 for list directed output says:

"Complex constants are enclosed in parentheses with a
separator between the real and imaginary parts, each
produced as defined above for real constants. The separator
is a comma if the decimal edit mode is POINT; it is a
semicolon if the decimal edit mode is COMMA."

There are similar words in most other places where complex
formatting is described.

The second paragraph of 10.10.1.3 Namelist group object list
items says:

"When the next effective item is of type complex, the input
form of the input value consists of a left parenthesis
followed by an ordered pair of numeric input fields
separated by a comma and followed by a right parenthesis. "

Other places correctly describe namelist complex output as
having a separator, either a comma or a semicolon, depending
on the decimal edit mode.

Should the namelist version be reworded to say "comma or
semicolon"?

ANSWER:

Yes.  Edits are supplied to correct this oversight.
In addition, a similar issue exists for list directed input of
undelimited character values and namelist output of character
values.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[240:13] Replace "comma" with "comma (if the decimal edit mode is POINT),
semicolon (if the decimal edit mode is COMMA)"

[244:29] Replace "comma" with "separator".
[244:30] Before "The first", add the following sentence:
           The separator is a comma if the decimal edit mode is POINT;
           it is a semicolon if the decimal edit mode is COMMA.
[244:32] Replace "comma" with "separator".
[244:33] Replace "comma" with "separator".

[245:4] after "comma," insert " semicolon,"

the first edit, which caused 0028 to fail in the last letter ballot,
now changes the sentence at 04-007 [240:12-14] to read:

OLD (before any edits)
If the delimiters are omitted, the character sequence is terminated
by the first blank, comma, slash, or end of record; in this case
apostrophes and quotation marks within the datum are not to be doubled.

NEW (after applying EDIT 1)
If the delimiters are omitted, the character sequence is terminated
by the first blank, comma (if the decimal edit mode is POINT),
semicolon (if the decimal edit mode is COMMA), slash, or end of record;
in this case apostrophes and quotation marks within the datum are not
to be doubled.
