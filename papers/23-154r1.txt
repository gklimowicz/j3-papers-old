Subject: US Initial Recommendations for F202Y 
Date: 2023-June-15


This paper summarizes the U.S. National Body initial recommendation of
features for the next revision of the Fortran standard (informally known as
F202Y). Each item in this list has associated J3 paper(s) with detailed
descriptions or requirements. No priority order is implied. 


US01. Obsolete default implicit typing. 
      See 23-177.

US02. Obsolete D format edit descriptor.
      See 23-178.

US03. Add note that the real model is not IEEE 754.
      See 23-180.

US04. Asynchronous Tasks: Provide a mechanism for asynchronous execution of
      blocks of codes.
      See 23-174.

US05. Add extended floating-point types defined in ISO C23 to 
      ISO_C_BINDING.
      See 23-176.

US06. Provide a mechanism to specify global binding name for non
      C-interoperable. 
      See 23-201.

US07. More rank-independent functionality.
      See 23-184r1 for a list of proposals under consideration.

US08. Polymorphic PURE function results.
      See 23-186.

US09. Allow I/O of enumeration type names.
      See 23-151r1.

US10. Define a standard Fortran preprocessor.
      See 23-192r1.

US11. Provide intrinsics for source location.
      See 23-193r1.

US12. Add maximum rank/corank constants to ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.
      See 23-194.

US13. Remote access to module entities.
      See 23-196r1.

US14. Provide scoped access to enumeration enumerators.
      See 23-197.

US15. Readonly pointers: a new attribute be applicable to pointers that 
      determines whether the target of the pointer cannot be changed 
      through the pointer. 
      See 23-198.

US16. Provide a facility to specify the default kinds within the program
      unit. 
      See 23-199.

US17. Generic programming using templates.
      23-148, 23-103, and their references therein.
