1. Introduction
---------------

The term "module procedure" is inadvertently defined as including generics
in intrinsic modules (but not generics in nonintrinsic modules).  The term
is intended to cover specific procedures and not generic ones.

A later statement about module procedures omits procedures in intrinsic
modules entirely.

2. Response to GB-003 and GB-038
--------------------------------

GB-003: Accepted as is.
GB-038: Accepted with modification (to make the wording closer to that
        of the definition).

3. Edits to N2146
-----------------

Page 18, 3.112.4 module procedure,
  Before "procedure provided by an intrinsic module (R1408)"
  Insert "specific"
making the whole definition read
  "procedure defined by a module subprogram, or a specific procedure
   provided by an intrinsic module (R1408)"
{GB-003.}

Page 299, 15.2.2.2 External, internal, and module procedures, p3,
  After "A module procedure is a procedure that is defined by a module
         subprogram"
  Insert ", or a specific procedure provided by an intrinsic module"
making the whole paragraph read
  "A module procedure is a procedure that is defined by a module
   subprogram, or a specific procedure provided by an intrinsic module."
{GB-038.}
