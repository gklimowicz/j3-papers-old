Date: 2011 June 10th
Reference: N1854

The actual arguments to assumed-type dummies do NOT have to be
interoperable types ([5:15-16] and [26:2-3]), but two references to
descriptors imply that they do.  As the constraints are elsewhere, the
wording is redundant anyway.

Edits to N1854:
---------------

[20:44] Delete "of interoperable type and type parameters".

[28:31] Delete "of interoperable type and type parameters".
