Introduction

Unresolved issue 364

    Paper 02-129r2 emasculated this subclause (7.3), and reasonably
    so.  We should probably finish the job.  What remains is one
    short sentence of meat (the first one).  The second sentence is
    all but identical to one in 7.2 (on intrinsic operations).  The
    third also applies equally well to intrinsic and defined
    operations.  One sentence doesn't seem enough for a top-level
    subclause in a clause about 36 pages long. None of the other
    top-level subclauses here are down to distinguishing between
    intrinsic and derived operations.  I suggest we merge this
    material into 7.2.  The two sentences that apply to all
    operations can be stated once in a way that applies to all.
    The one sentence of meat can either remain a sentence or can be
    a one-sentence subclause one level lower (7.2.5, presumably).
    Minor editing to 7.2.0 would be needed.

Edits

135:9       [Editor: Delete "intrinsic".]

135:14-17   Replace the paragraph with the following:
    The interpretation of a defined operation is provided by the
    function that defines the operation.  The type, type parameters
    and interpretation of an expression that consists of an
    intrinsic or defined operation are independent of the type and
    type parameters of the context or any larger expression in
    which it appears.

135:18  Add, immediately before section 7.2.1:
    The operators <, <=, >, >=, ==, and /= always have the same
    interpretations as the operators .LT., .LE., .GT., .GE., .EQ.,
    and .NE., respectively.

137:3-5     [Editor: Delete "The ... respectively."]

138:10-15   [Editor: Delete subclause 7.3.]

139:0+      [Editor: Delete unresolved issue note 364.]
