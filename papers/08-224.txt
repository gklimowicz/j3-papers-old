Commenter's Subject was "constraint C542"

Consider the following program:

       PROGRAM MAIN
         INTRINSIC SQRT
         INTERFACE SQRT
           REAL FUNCTION MYSQRT(X)
           END FUNCTION
         END INTERFACE
       END

       REAL FUNCTION MYSQRT(X)
         MYSQRT = SQRT(X)
       END

This program clearly violates constraint C542 in
Section 5.3.11 of the Fortran 2008 draft.  I have
had an e-mail correspondence with a member of the
committee who states that interpretation 90/000083
makes it clear that the committee intended to
allow programs such as the one above.  If that is
so, the final clause of constraint C542, which says

   and the characteristics of the specific
   intrinsic procedures and the procedures
   in the interfaces shall differ as specified
   in 12.4.3.4.5

should be removed.  If the committee holds that the
constraint as written is valid, I suggest adding a
note giving an example such as the one above to
confirm that the constraint is the intent of the
committee.
