Discussion:
-----------

The six comments 24, 25, 33, 34, 35, and 44 all make the point that the
description of an image control statement should specify how it affects
the ordering of segments, as is done for SYNC ALL. At [210:10-12], we
have "The segments that executed before the SYNC ALL statement on an
image precede the segments that execute after the SYNC ALL statement
on another image.".

Edits here provide similar wording for ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE,
CHANGE TEAM, END TEAM, and FORM TEAM. The proposed edits for
CHANGE TEAM drew our attention to the similarity between paras 5 and 6
of 11.1.5.1, which would both have needed the same added sentence. We
therefore propose here that the text of these paragraphs be merged.

Edits to 17-007r2:
---------------

[142:36] In 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 4, after
"the same number of times in this team." add:
"The segments that executed before the ALLOCATE statement on an active
image of the current team precede the segments that execute after the
ALLOCATE statement on another active image of the current team."

[146:8] In 9.7.3.2 Deallocation of allocatable variables, para 10,
after "the same number of times in this team." add:
"The segments that executed before the statement on an active image of
the current team precede the segments that execute after the statement
on another active image of the current team."

[188:19-27] In 11.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct,
replace paras 5 and 6 by
"Successful execution of a CHANGE TEAM statement performs an implicit
synchronization of all images of the new team that is identified by
<team-value>. If the new team contains a failed image and no other
error condition occurs, there is an implicit synchronization of all
active images of the new team. All active images of the new team shall
execute the same CHANGE TEAM statement. On each active image of the new
team, execution of the segment following the CHANGE TEAM statement is
delayed until all other active images of that team have executed the
same statement the same number of times in the original team. The
segments that executed before the CHANGE TEAM statement on an active
image of the new team precede the segments that execute after the
CHANGE TEAM statement on another active image of that team."

[188:31] In 11.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct, para 7,
after "the same number of times in this team." add:
"The segments that executed before the END TEAM statement on an active
image of the new team precede the segments that execute after the
END TEAM statement on another active image of that team."

[215:8] In 11.6.9 FORM TEAM statement, para 5,
after "the same number of times in this team." add:
"The segments that executed before the FORM TEAM statement on an active
image of the current team precede the segments that execute after the
FORM TEAM statement on another active image of the current team."
