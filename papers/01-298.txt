Subject:  Sj Response to a WG5 comment (bindname)

One of the comments made by WG5 members at the recent London
meeting expressed a concern regarding bindname.  The criticism
was that we hadn't thought this through very well.  Fortran
supports bind(c), if the processor can't figure out the c name,
how is it to get the other details of the calling sequence right?.
J3 members present were unable to provide a good answer to this
question.  WG5 expressed its desire to remove bindname from the
draft.  This paper is a vehicle for removing  bindname from the
draft should J3 decide to do so, or alternatively, for replying
to WG5 with our reasons why bindname should be kept in the draft.

To remove bindname from the draft:
(Yes, I know I need to provide line numbers.
Let's see what Inertop says before I do it.  My pdf
version doesn't seem to have line numbers,
at least, I haven't found the switch.)

EDITS

(Remove paragraph discussing bindname.)
