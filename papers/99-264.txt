1. Introduction

Unresolved issue 137 says:
  "In 5.1.1.5, in the list of places where * can be used for a character
  length.  As a general rule, be suspicious of any condition that just says "in
  an X statement."  There are many places in an ALLOCATE statement where a
  character length parameter would be syntactically valid.  Consider
  constructors used in expressions.  I think you have only one particular use
  in mind."

I concur.

2. Edits

[74:23-24] Replace "in an ... argument" with
  "in the <type-spec> of an ALLOCATE statement when each <allocate-object> is
   a dummy argument of type CHARACTER with assumed character length"
{Specify the allowed usage more precisely.}

[74:25-30] Delete.
{Delete the J3 note.}
