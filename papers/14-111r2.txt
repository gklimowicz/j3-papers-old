Discussion
----------

We add the optional argument TEAM to FAILED_IMAGES because it may
be undesirable to exit the team execution context to obtain information
about which images in an ancestor team have failed (see the vote of
Reinhold Bader in N1999).


Edits to N1996:
---------------

[24:1] Change line to
7.4.12 FAILED_IMAGES ([TEAM, KIND])

[24:3+] Add
<<Arguments.>>
TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar of the type TEAM_TYPE defined in the
      ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. Its value shall represent an
      ancestor team. If TEAM is present, its value specifies the team;
      otherwise, the team specified is the current team.

[24:4-6] Remove "Argument." and indent the rest of the paragraph in the
usual way for an argument description.

[24:9] After "failed images" add "in the specified team".

[24:10] Change "current" to "specified".

[32:1-] In the table entry for FAILED_IMAGES, change "KIND" to
"TEAM, KIND".
