Subject: Nonconforming example in C.3.3 Generic type-bound procedures

References: 21-007

21-007 document in C.3.3 Generic type-bound procedures lists an
example of a derived type with generic type-bound procedures with an
instruction on page 552, line 26 that does not conform with C1588
which states, "An INTENT (OUT) dummy argument of a pure procedure
shall not be polymorphic .."

The following edit is proposed.

[552:26]
Change
   CLASS(rational),INTENT(OUT) :: a

to
   CLASS(rational),INTENT(INOUT) :: a
