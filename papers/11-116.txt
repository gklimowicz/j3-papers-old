DISCUSSION

In N1838, 3.3 para 1 makes it clear that an assumed-rank dummy argument
takes its rank from that of the corresponding actual argument, which is
incompatible with sequence association. Unresolved Technical Issue TR8
asks for an edit to the standard that makes this clear.

EDIT to N1838:

[5:13] At the end of the sentence, add

The following edit to ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 is needed, since an
assumed-rank dummy argument has the rank of the corresponding actual
argument, which is incompatible with sequence association.

12.5.2.4 Ordinary dummy variables
In paragraph 13, line 4, after 'assumed-shape,' add 'assumed-rank'.
