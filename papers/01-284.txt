Page 13, 2.2.3.4, third line.  Change "or that" to "or to specify that"

Page 16, 2.4.3, third line  excneption -> exception

Page 19, 2.5.2 (2) first line  IN -> In

Page 17, 2.4.3.1.1, second paragraph, third line.  Capitalize last
sentence.

Page 31, next to last line.  Bad line break.

Page 45, note 4.26.  Put blanks around the = after organizer

Page 46, note 4.31.  C.1.4 also initializes value to 0.  We should do
that here to avoid confusion.

Page 56, paragraph after note 4.58.  NULL()  In other cases I think we
use NULL( ) with a space between ( and ) to make it easier to not be
confused with NULL0.  Probably need a good GREP here

Page 65, C530.  Should this apply to R501 rather than R514?

Page 84, C575.  There appears to be no space after the (R553)

Page 107, section 7, first line.  Delete the "the" before "assignment"

Page 107, note 7.1.  Delete the space between B and C and their
subscripts

Page 113, 7.1.4.1, fifth line.  Remove parens around 4.5.8 ala next
line.

Page 113, 7.1.4.2 last 2 lines.  Debold "op" in two places.  Also 4
places in first paragraph on next page.

Possibly not a typo:
Page 285.  13.11.16.  The description for BIT_SIZE refers to "z" bits as
defined in the model.  The model is really in terms of "q" bits.  Change
"z" to "q"  in 3 places
