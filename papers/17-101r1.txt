Subject:   F2008 interp: Limitions on coarray by C526 and associating
Date: 2017 February 06


1. Introduction

Constraint C825 appears to have the side-effect of prohibiting the
selector of an ASSOCIATE construct from being a coarray with the
ALLOCATABLE attribute.  This is obviously unintentional, as otherwise we
would have stated it more directly.  Furthermore, there is no prohibition
against a coarray with the SAVE attribute as a selector.


2. Discussion

This probably does not need any entry in the Introduction, as this was a
minor contradiction in Fortran 2008, and our intention was fairly clear.

The previous revision of this paper was phrased as an interpretation
request, but as we are not going to produce another corrigendum for
Fortran 2008 it seems simplest to fix the mistake in Fortran 2015.


3. Edit to 17-007

[101:24] 8.5.6.1 General (in 8.5.6 CODMENSION attribute), C825,
  After "A coarray or an object with a coarray ultimate component
         shall be"
  Change "a dummy argument or"
  To     "an associate name, a dummy argument, or"
  Making the whole constraint read
    "C825 A coarray or an object with a coarray ultimate component shall
          be an associate name, a dummy argument, or have the ALLOCATABLE
          or SAVE attribute."
{TECHNICAL FIX.}
