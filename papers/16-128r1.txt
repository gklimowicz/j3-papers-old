Subject:    No interp needed concerning PAD mode and EOR= specifier
Date: 2016 February 10

There is no need for an F2008 interp for this issue.  10-007r1 [241:37-
40] says "if the pad mode has the value ... NO, the input list item
becomes undefined;".  For the example below reading values for I and J,
and hitting EOR while processing input list item K, K becomes undefined.

[241:41] says "processing of the input list, if any, terminates;".
Therefore the value of L is unchanged, not undefined.

The issue described below is answered by the existing text so no interp
is needed.  The unaltered text from 16-128 follows.

NUMBER: F08/nnnn
TITLE: PAD mode and EOR= specifier
KEYWORDS: PAD mode, EOR= specifier
DEFECT TYPE: TBD
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTIONS:

Consider the following program:

program P
  integer :: I, J, K, L
  open ( 10, file='F', recl=10, pad='no' )
  read ( 10, '(4i5)', advance='no', eor=9 ) i, j, k, l
9 print *, i, j, k, l
end program P

Suppose file F has the following contents:

   41   42
   43   44

In paragraph 1 of subclause 9.11.4, list item (1)(b) says if an
end-of-record condition occurs and an EOR= specifier appears and the
pad mode has the value NO, "the input list item becomes undefined."

If there are several items in the input list, which ones become
undefined?

In the question, which variables are undefined at statement 9?

ANSWER:

The intent was that only the variables k and l are undefined at
statement 9.

Edits are provided to clarify this confusion.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[241:40 9.11.4p1(1)(b)] Replace "the list item becomes" with "list
items for which corresponding edit descriptors require more characters
than the record contains become".
