Description:
============

During the construction of 13-293 (N1983) some issues were noted that
were outside the bounds of editorial fixes.  Those are recorded in
this paper.  Page and line numbers are relative to 13-293.


Issues:
=======


Clause 5 Teams of images
------------------------


I1: [9:22-29] The reason for disallowing the POINTER attribute for a
          variable with a subobject of type TEAM_TYPE should be
          documented, with explanation of why it is not a requirement
          for a variable of type TEAM_TYPE.

I2: [9:22-29, 13:15-22] We now have very similar sets of constraints
          for variables of type LOCK_TYPE, TEAM_TYPE, and
          EVENT_TYPE. The basic reason is the same in all cases - the
          desire to restrict definition of such variables to a limited
          set of statements.  Perhaps constraints for a new concept,
          such as "restricted type" or "restricted-use type" could be
          written once and then referenced for the three cases.

I3: [10:29] The new syntax for image selectors needs illustrative
          examples. A Note at the end of 5.4 [10:32+] would be good;
          at least an example in the Annex.

I4: [11:1] The new syntax to allow a team member to choose an image
          index value needs illustrative examples. A Note at the end
          of 5.5 [11:17+] would be good; at least an example in the
          Annex.

I5: [12:4+] Would it be useful to have another Note that says failure
          of image 1 of the initial team of images is particularly
          problematic because of the lost connection to standard
          input?


Clause 6 Events
---------------


I6: [13:29+] In the new Atomic subroutines section we say that "How
          sequences of atomic actions in unordered segments interleave
          with each other is processor dependent."  That text is
          copied from F2008. Should we have a similar statement about
          event posts, since they are similar to atomic operations?


Clause 7 Intrinsic procedures
-----------------------------

I7: [15:15-16] In the case of an optional OLD argument to an atomic
           subroutine, the code generated is different depending on
           whether OLD is present or not. This is a side effect of
           economizing on subroutine names by using the same name for
           two operations. If the user writes an OLD argument into the
           call, it will almost always be the case that it will be
           referenced soon after the call. We should probably say that
           and optional OLD argument that appears shall be present.


I8: [15:32-34] The first sentence of paragraph 5 in 7.3 says that a
           failed execution of a collective is the same as SYNC MEMORY
           which has the effect of making it an image control
           statement. But a successful execution is not an image
           control statement.  This is not consistent.  The end of the
           sentence "and the effect...SYNC MEMORY statement" should be
           deleted.

I9: [15:38-39] The last sentence of the same paragraph says "..an
           image had failed..". It is unclear what images count
           here. Any one from the initial team, or just ones in the
           current team (and hence involved with the call)? Probably
           intend the current team, but it should be clarified.


I10: [19:37] In the description of the OPERATOR argument to CO_REDUCE
            we say that the operation is commutative, but fail to say
            is is associative.  That should be added.


Clause 8 Required editorial changes to ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010(E)
-------------------------------------------------------------


I11: [26:38+] In Note 4.48 in 4.5.6.2 The finalization process of
            10-007r1, we might need to add "in the current team" at
            the end and consider rewording to avoid the word
            "event". This would require a new subclause in the TS:
            Edits to clause 4.


I12: [27:22+] We need an edit for the STAT= description in 6.7.4
            similar to the new text in [28:28-36] to account for
            "current team" and also STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.

I13: [27:27+] Does the exclusive execution of a CRITICAL construct
            apply to all images of the initial team of images, or just
            the current team? Probably the initial set (because it is
            usually use to protect a global resource), but that should
            be clarified.

I14: [28:25,28,38] The new text in the edits for 8.5.7 includes the
            case of a STAT= specifier appearing on an END TEAM
            statement, but there is no syntax for that. Note that the
            text at [28:23-24] contains the "as an appearance both
            there and in the corresponding END TEAM". This text has
            various ambiguities and needs to be fixed, or specific
            syntax added for END TEAM.

I15: [28:22-29:3] For the STAT= edits, there is no mention of EVENT
            POST or EVENT WAIT. Both of these statements have optional
            STAT=.

I16: [30:4-9] In the table entries for intrinsics we refer to "all
            images" 5 times in reference to collectives. This needs
            the "current team" fix.  Or just say "across images".
