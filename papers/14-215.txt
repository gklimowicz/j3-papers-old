    these minutes, that committee will be referred to as J3.

2.  WG5 sessions were chaired by John Reid, the WG5 convenor.
    J3 sessions were chaired by Dan Nagle, the J3 chair.

    "** /WG5 **" marks a WG5 section of the meeting.
    "** /J3 **"  marks a J3 section of the meeting.

3.  The WG5 draft minutes were expertly prepared by David Muxworthy
    and can be found in N2020.  Various WG5 discussions were so
    diplomatically summarized therein that these minutes quote N2020
    when the J3 secretary deemed it prudent.

4.  These J3 minutes were reconstructed from notes graciously
    provided to the secretary by Bill Long, Dan Nagle, Malcolm Cohen,
    and Steve Lionel.  Any errors or omissions in these minutes are
    the secretary's responsibility alone.

1. Opening of the Meeting

The meeting opened at 08:08 on 23rd June 2014.

2. Opening business

2.1 Introductory remarks from the Convenor
The convenor said that the principal objectives of the meeting were to
develop the draft TS on further coarray facilities and to choose the
list of deficiencies and discrepancies in Fortran 2008 to be addressed
in the next revision.  There would be initial set of straw votes on
items that had been proposed and they would then be passed to
subgroups for more detailed consideration.

2.2 Welcome from the Host

Steve Lionel welcomed participants on behalf of PL22.3.

2.3 Local arrangements

Steve Lionel invited participants to dinner at Battista's restaurant
on the Wednesday evening.

2.4 Appointments for this meeting

The drafting committee was Reinhold Bader, Daniel Chen, Toon
Moene, David Muxworthy (chair), Steve Lionel, and Masayuki Takata.
David Muxworthy was secretary and John Reid was librarian.

2.5 Adoption of the agenda (N2010)

The preliminary agenda was adopted.

2.6 Approval of the minutes of the Delft 2013 Meeting (N1977)

The minutes of the 2013 meeting had been discussed and approved by
email during July 2013.  It was noted that minutes are now circulated
for approval by WG5 letter ballot approximately one month after each
meeting.

3. Matters arising from the minutes

There were no items not otherwise on the agenda.

4. Status of Delft 2013 Resolutions [N1978]

There was nothing to report.

5. Reports

5.1 SC22 Matters (Convener)

Convenorship.  John Reid's term as convenor would end in September
2014.  He was willing to continue for one more three-year term but
would stand aside if any other member wished to volunteer for the
post.  He was encouraged to continue for another three years.

Change in ISO rules.  Changes to rules meant that every working group
member was acting as an individual and did not represent a member
body.  However since SC22 ballots were conducted on a country by
country basis, it was proposed to continue WG5 procedures as before,
that is recording country positions as well as taking votes by
individual members.  National activity reports would be optional.

Document archive.  ISO required that all working group documents be
held on their website.  It had been agreed that all SC22 documents
should have open access.  John Reid was in the process of moving the
WG5 archive to the ISO website, rearranging the documents into year
folders, rather than using the current system of folders of 50
documents.  ISO also required working groups to use their email
system.  It was hoped that the current email system would continue.

WG23 (Vulnerabilities).  This matter was postponed to the
Vulnerabilities liaison report (5.5 below).

5.2 National Activity Reports

Canada:      There was little standards activity related to Fortran.  IBM
             had recently released a compiler with more of Fortran 2008.

Germany:     No report.

Japan:       Preparation for the Japanese version of Fortran 2008
             continued but would need more than one year to complete.
             Japan had been proposing in the SC22 ballot to vote against
             disbandment of WG23.

Netherlands: The Programming Languages Committee of the Netherlands
             meets twice a year, and parallels SC22 activities. Four
             language experts are members of the committee, for the
             following languages: C, C++, Cobol and Fortran. The
             committee votes, when requested by ISO, on language
             specific issues.

             As an example, the vote on Corrigendum 3 of the Fortran
             2008 Standard was approval in the March 2014 meeting,
             after the major problems addressed in the Corrigendum and
             the work that had gone into it to fix them had been
             explained.

             Aside from this regular work, the proposed disbanding of
             WG23 led to quite some discussion on the mailing list.

UK:          The report is in N2017.  The main item of interest was
             arrangements for the 2015 WG5 meeting in London.  There
             was also related information in N2018 and N2019.

US:          The main activity was that of PL22.3.  Steve Lionel had
             been on an INCITS training course.

5.3 Report from Primary Development Body (INCITS/PL22.3)

Development had been proceeding to schedule.  All items specified by
WG5, other than conformance to ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011, had been
implemented.

5.4 Reports from other Development Bodies (Editors/Heads)

Interoperability TS: Bill Long
     Development of the Further Coarray TS was proceeding.

5.5 Liaison Reports

NCITS/PL22.11 (C): Dan Nagle
     The CPLEX work, to provide parallel facilities in C,
     continues. OpenMP will not incorporate all of OpenACC.

MPI: Bill Long
     There was progress in updating interfacing from Fortran 95 to
     Fortran 2008 + TS 29113.  In particular there was progress on
     modules.  It had been agreed to drop Fortran 77 support.  A paper
     "Implementing the MPI-3.0 Fortran 2008 Binding" had been accepted
     for presentation at the EuroMPI/ASIA 2014 conference in Kyoto on
     September 10-12, 2014.

     MPICH 3.1.1 release has Fortran 2008 support. Tests for Fortran 90
     have been ported to Fortran 2008 and are working well.

     There are three relevant Working groups for MPI 4.0: Fault
     Tolerance (resiliency), Hybrid (interaction with OpenMP, CAF,
     OpenCL,...), Fortran (yet better interfaces).

UPC: Damian Rouson
     No report.

IFIP/WG2.5: Van Snyder
     An IEEE project would be set up after the July 2014 meeting in
     Vienna.  There was interest in interval arithmetic.  John Reid
     had offered to talk on the Further Coarray TS.

OpenMP: Bill Long
     The OpenMP 4.0 standard would be fully supported in gfortran 4.10,
     due in April 2015.

WG23 (Vulnerabilities): Dan Nagle
     WG23 had not met since September 2013 as no meeting had been
     called.  A motion in PL22 to propose that WG23 be disbanded had
     failed but a subsequent PL22 letter ballot had succeeded.  The
     motion had been forwarded to SC22 for an SC22 letter ballot.
     This was initially accepted but then cancelled on the grounds
     that such an important decision should not be made by letter
     ballot.  The matter was to be discussed at the SC22 plenary
     meeting in September 2014.

     Ada contributors had stopped work until the politics had been
     resolved.  A group of people active in other SC22 working groups
     but not previously active in WG23 were thought to be the
     principal motivators in proposing disbandment.  WG5 had been
     asked if it would publish the next edition of TR24772 but WG5 had
     neither the resources nor the expertise.

     As well as the Vulnerabilities TR the working group had the project
     DIS17960, Code Signing for Source Code.

6. Construct the PDTS on Further Coarray Features.

Apart from a WG5 straw vote taken on Thursday, development of the PDTS
was conducted in PL22.3 mode throughout the week.  In total 16 PL22.3
papers with edits to N2007 were approved (viz. 14-141r2, 14-147r1,
14-148r2, 14-151r3, 14-152r2, 14-156r3, 14-157r2, 14-158r3, 14-160r4,
14-172, 14-173r2, 14-185r1, 14-205r1, 14-210, 14-212r1, 14-213r1).

7. Consider the Fortran defect reports (interpretations) in J3/14-006.

No defect reports were presented for WG5 consideration at this meeting.

8. Construct list of deficiencies and discrepancies in Fortran 2008
   to be addressed in the next revision.

To guide discussion at the meeting, straw votes were held on proposals
submitted for possible changes to Fortran 2008.

US-19 (J3/14-128r)1 Making WHERE obsolescent:                        1-9-5
US-20 (J3/14-165)   PROTECTED attribute for types:                   1-6-8

It was decided that edits relevant to the Further Coarray TS agreed
during the meeting should be written relative to the TS rather than
to the revised language document.

2.1 F2008 Plenary

** /WG5 **

An early draft of N2023 listed preliminary decisions on whether or not
to progress the items for language revision listed above.  This
document was agreed.

As the schedules in N1979 had not been adhered to, an early draft of
N2024 was presented which gave three options for scheduling the two
principal projects.  After discussion they were voted on separately as
follows:

Plan A: Delay both the Further Coarray TS and the language revision
        for one year.            Straw vote: 10 yes - 2 no - 3 undecided

Plan B: Incorporate the further coarray facilities into the language
        revision which would cause a delay on the language standard of
        eight months.             Straw vote: 5 yes - 7 no - 3 undecided

Plan C: Keep the current schedule for the language revision and
        address the TS to the revision, delaying the TS by two years
        and eight months.         Straw vote: 5 yes - 7 no - 3 undecided

** /WG5 **

9. Review of the current draft of the next revision.

The draft was still being developed.

10. WG5 Business and Strategic Plans

10.1 Goals for 2014-2017

These had been discussed throughout the week and led to the plans in
N2024.

11. Closing Business

11.1 Future meetings

Arrangements for the 2016 WG5 meeting in Boulder were discussed.  The
straw vote on first preferences for dates was:
  June 5-10: 10  -   July 31-August 5: 3  -   August 7-12: 1.

On hotels, low price was considered more important than distance from
the meeting venue.

There was a discussion on the venue for the 2017 meeting.  There was a
slight preference for Munich over Tokyo with August suggested as the
most likely date.

11.2 Any other business

None was raised.

12. Adoption of Resolutions (N2021)

12.3 N2021 - RESOLUTIONS OF THE WG5 MEETING
             ON JUNE 23 TO 27, 2014 IN LAS VEGAS, NV, USA

  The meeting was attended by the convenor and 17 members from six
  national member bodies.  Resolutions LV1, LV2, LV9, LV10 and LV11
  were approved by unanimous acclaim.  Resolution LV3 passed after a
  vote which is shown following the text of the resolution.
  Resolutions LV4 to LV8 were approved by unanimous consent.

  LV1.  Convenorship of WG5

  WG5 thanks John Reid for his successful convenorship of WG5 and
  encourages him to stand for re-election at the SC22 meeting in
  September for a further three-year term.

  LV2.  Appreciation of Alessandro Fanfarillo

  WG5 thanks Alessandro Fanfarillo for his contribution to the meeting
  and for his excellent presentation on Coarrays in GNU Fortran.

  LV3.  Strategic Plan for WG5

  WG5 adopts document WG5-N2024, superseding WG5-N1979, as its strategic
  plan for the next three years.
    Individual votes:      12 yes 2 no 1 abstain
    Member body positions: 4 yes (Canada, Germany, Netherlands, USA)
                           0 no
                           2 abstain (Japan, UK)

  LV4. Revision of Fortran 2008

  WG5 adopts WG5-N2023 as the second set of proposals for the revision of
  Fortran 2008.

  LV5.  Website and email

  WG5 welcomes the decision of ISO to allow all WG5 documents on its new
  website to have open access.  Further, WG5 expresses its wish to
  continue to use its own well-established email systems.

  LV6.  National Positions

  WG5 proposes to continue to take national member body positions into
  account at its meetings since its documents will be voted on by
  national member bodies in SC22 and JTC1 ballots.

  LV7.  Corrigendum for Fortran 2008

  WG5 records that it will produce a fourth corrigendum for Fortran 2008.

  LV8.  Status of WG23

  WG5, having prepared a Fortran Annex for the third edition of TR 24772,
  wishes to see this work successfully concluded and therefore opposes
  any proposal to disband WG23 at this time.  Since a primary purpose of
  TR 24772 is to facilitate inter-language comparison, publication of the
  Fortran Annex as a separate document would not serve this purpose.

  LV9.  Future Meetings

  WG5 thanks BSI for inviting WG5 to meet in London, UK on August 3-7,
  2015, BCS for providing meeting rooms and Jane Sleightholme, Ian Chivers
  and Peter Crouch for making local arrangements.  WG5 thanks Dan Nagle
  for inviting WG5 to meet in Boulder, CO on June 5-10, 2016.  Further,
  WG5 thanks Reinhold Bader for offering to investigate hosting a WG5
  meeting in Munich, Germany in the summer of 2017.

  LV10.  Vote of Thanks for Support

  WG5 thanks PL22.3 for generously providing financial support for the
  meeting and for the social event.

  LV11.  Vote of Thanks

  WG5 expresses its appreciation to the convenor (John Reid), the
  secretary (David Muxworthy) and the drafting committee (Reinhold
  Bader, Daniel Chen, Toon Moene, David Muxworthy (chair), Steve Lionel,
  Masayuki Takata) for their contributions to the success of the meeting.
  It wishes especially to thank the hosts (Steve Lionel and Van Snyder)
  for the excellent arrangements for both the business and social parts
  of the meeting.

There was a discussion on the future of the WG5 document archive, the
website and the email systems but there was insufficient information
available to make useful proposals.  It was thought that the position
would be clearer following the SC22 meeting in September.

13. Adjournment

The meeting adjourned at 11:05 on Friday, June 27, 2014.
