Title: Rewrite attribute requirements

Submitted by: Malcolm Cohen

Status: For consideration

References: None.

Basic Functionality: None.

Rationale:
  The current method of specifying the requirements on various attributes,
  such as EXTERNAL and POINTER, is too hard to understand and too prone to
  error.

Estimated impact: Non-trivial Editorial.

Detailed Specification:
  Rewrite the attribute specification parts of chapters 5 and 12 so that
  (1) the syntax just says what attribute it provides
  (2) there is a separate attribute section which
      (a) contains the requirements (like "must be a dummy argument for VALUE")
      (b) describes the effects.

History: Submitted by paper J3/04-359 at meeting 169.
