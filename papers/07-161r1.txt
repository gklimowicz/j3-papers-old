07-161 proposed that C_PTR and C_FUNPTR ought to have pointer components.
That proposal was rejected in J3 plenary, so only the advice to remove
UTI 192 remains:

[502:34+][Editor: Delete UTI 192]

The original edits, for the illumination of posterity, were:

[474:3][Editor: Replace ``either ... or a pointer'' by ``objects of
either of these types is allocatable.  Objects of type C_PTR have a
direct component that is a data pointer.  Objects of type C_FUNPTR have a
direct component that is a procedure pointer.''.]

[474:4+5+][Editor: Insert Note 15.11a:]

Note 15.11a
  Although objects of these types have pointer components, the components
  are private.  Therefore a program cannot depend upon the
  characteristics of those components as Fortran objects, and the
  processor can choose the representation of these pointers to be
  identical to the representation the companion processor uses for C
  pointers, which might be different from the representation of any
  Fortran pointer.
