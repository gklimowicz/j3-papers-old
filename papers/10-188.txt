NUMBER: F03/0037
TITLE: PROCEDURE POINTER vs PROTECTED
KEYWORDS: PROCEDURE, PROTECTED
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following module fragment correct syntax for an abstract
interface i_f?

    procedure(i_f), pointer, protected :: p_f1 => null()

F2008 10-007 [100:4] C549 says

    "An entity with the PROTECTED attribute shall be a procedure
     pointer or variable."

But 12.4.3.6 [287:11+] does not list PROTECTED as an allowable
attribute on the procedure declaration statement.

ANSWER:

The module fragment was intended to be standard-conforming.  An
edit is provided to correct this.

EDITS to 10-007:

[287:15+] in R1213 after "<<or>> POINTER", insert a new line

            "<<or>> PROTECTED"
