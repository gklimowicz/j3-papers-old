Subject:  Interpretation: attributes allowed for dummy arguments in
          defined assignments

NUMBER: F03/0112
TITLE: attributes allowed for dummy arguments in defined assignments
KEYWORDS: defined assignment, dummy argument, attributes
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by J3 ballot

DISCUSSION:

It seems the standard is quite loose in allowing various attributes
declared for the dummy arguments used in a defined assignment (7.4.1.4).
In particular, attributes such as POINTER and ALLOCATABLE can be
declared for dummy arguments in the defined assignment.  However the
interpretations on their declarations need to be clarified.

Consider the follow subroutines (assuming a derived type DT already
defined)

    1. POINTER/ALLOCATABLE on the second dummy argument

    interface ASSIGNMENT (=)
    subroutine defAssgn1 (dt1, dt2)
        type(DT), intent(out) :: dt1
        type(DT), POINTER, intent(in) :: dt2
    end subroutine
    end interface

    In 12.3.2.1.2 [263:10-12], the standard says the following
    "A defined assignment is treated as a reference to the subroutine,
     with the left-hand side as the first argument and the right-hand
     side enclosed in parentheses as the second argument."

    This statement seems to prohibit the use of subroutine defAssgn1 for
    defined assignment since a pointer enclosed in parentheses refers
    to its associated target not the pointer itself, as indicated by
    rules in 7.1.4.1 [123:39-124:3].

    2. POINTER/ALLOCATABLE on the first dummy argument

    interface ASSIGNMENT (=)
    subroutine defAssgn2 (dt1, dt2)
        type(DT), POINTER, intent(out) :: dt1
        type(DT), intent(in) :: dt2
    end subroutine
    end interface

    There are no rules in the standard disallow this declaration. However
    the use of POINTER/ALLOCATABLE attributes on the first dummy argument
    is very doubtful.  Since POINTER/ALLOCATABLE attributes don't
    disambiguate generic declarations(16.2.3), their use will prevent the
    normal declarations of defined assignments, wherein dt1 is declared
    without POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attribute.

QUESTIONS:

1.  Are POINTER and ALLOCATABLE attributes allowed for the second
    dummy argument in defined assignment?

2.  Are POINTER and ALLOCATABLE attributes allowed for the first
    dummy argument in defined assignment?

ANSWER:

Yes to both questions. The standard places very few restrictions on
the arguments to defined assignment subroutines:  [363:6...]

  Each of these subroutines shall have exactly two dummy arguments.
  Each argument shall be nonoptional.  The first argument shall have
  INTENT (OUT) or INTENT (INOUT) and the second argument shall have
  INTENT (IN). ...

Preventing the first argument from having the POINTER
attribute violates F90.  Such a restriction for the second argument
has no effect since the right argument is treated as an expression
enclosed in parentheses which would have neither attribute.

EDITS:

None

NOTE:

A future standard should disallow the POINTER and ALLOCATABLE
attributes on the second argument to defined assignment subroutines.
