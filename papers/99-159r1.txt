Subject:     Recursive I/O

The first edit in paper 99-135 mentions the possibility that a
DTIO routine might close the file being read.  I believe that
this points out a problem that is really much broader and is
better fixed in another place (though the fix involves few
words).

We not only don't want the file in question closed, we don't want it
reopened, repositioned (except via data transfer), or otherwise
"messed with".  And we don't want any other external file operated on
either.  In f95, we disallowed all forms of recursive I/O by the
prohibition against I/O in a function referenced in an input/output
statement.  This was the only way that recursive I/O could have
occurred in f95.  The intention in f2k was to allow only two specific
forms of recursive I/O - recursive data transfer statements in DTIO,
plus recursive internal I/O more generally.  But the restrictions in
9.10 fail to prohibit the case of recursive I/O statements that are
not data transfer statements.  I believe this was accidental and that
this is where the fix should be.

Grep reveals that the term "recursive data transfer statement" is
defined and used only in 9.10.

Thus I propose the following edits to 99-007r1, all in 9.10.

  [228:9] "A data transfer" -> "An input/output"

  [228:10,11,14,2nd case on 9]
    "data transfer" -> "input/output"  (4 times)
    (but leave the one on line 12 and the one straddling 11-12 alone).

  [229:11-13] Delete the para.  This is now redundant; it is just
  one specific case of the reworded restriction at [228:11-13].
