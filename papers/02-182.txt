Subject:  Move some bind(c) details to section 15

It was pointed out in comp.lang.fortran that section 4.7  "Enumerations
and enumerators" contains details that are very specific to BIND(C)
and would be much more appropriate in section 15.  Move the details
of how BIND(C) selects the kind to 15 and put a forward reference
in 4.7.

Richard Maine thought it was a good idea and this paper is a place
holder so that things don't get forgotten.  If we do it, it is purely
editorial.
