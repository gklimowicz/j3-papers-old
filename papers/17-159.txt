Subject: Previously undocumented F2008 feature
Date: 2017 May 25


Discussion:

Fortran 2003 12.3.2.1 Interface block page 259 lines 42 begins the
sentence:

  "An explicit specific interface may be specified by an interface
   body for an external procedure that does not exist in the program
   if the procedure is never used in any way."

The submodule feature allows a nonexistent separate module procedure
interface to be used to specify an interface. For consistency with
the submodule feature, the above words were changed to:

  "If an external procedure does not exist in the program, an interface
   body for it may be used to specify an explicit specific interface
   but the procedure shall not be used in any other way."

This passed in paper 06-193r1 which was called an editorial change, but
is actually a feature.  Edits are provided to add it to Annex C.

Edits:

C.1 Fortran 2008 features not mentioned in its Introduction page 547
  [21+] Add bullet item
        "An interface body for an external procedure that does not exist
         in a program may be used to specify an explicit specific
         interface."
  [22]  Change "All but the last of the above" to "All but the last two
        of the above"
