NUMBER: F08/0038
TITLE: Are pointless restrictions on DIM arguments intended?
KEYWORDS: DIM argument, optional, intrinsic reduction function
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Under consideration

DISCUSSION:

Some of the reduction functions have two forms, one with a DIM
argument and one without; the DIM argument is not optional.  IALL is
an example.  Other reduction functions have a DIM argument that is
optional.  COUNT is an example.  The actual argument corresponding to
the DIM actual argument is prohibited from being an optional dummy
argument in both cases.  The reason in the case of an optional DIM
argument is so that the processor can determine the rank of the
result.  In the case of those with two forms, there is no problem for
the processor to determine the rank, so the prohibition against the
corresponding actual argument being an optional dummy argument is
pointless.  There is already a prohibition against it being an absent
optional dummy argument in 12.5.2.12p3(4).

Consider, for example

  subroutine S ( ARRAY, DIM )
    integer, intent(in) :: ARRAY(:,:)
    integer, intent(in), optional :: DIM
    if ( present(dim) ) then
      print *, iall(array,dim)
    else
      print *, iall(array)
    end if
  end subroutine S

This subroutine clearly does not conform, but a processor would have
no difficulty determining the rank of the result of IALL(ARRAY,DIM).

QUESTION:

(1) Was the pointless restriction intentional, or was it an oversight
that it did not get removed in the two-form case when MAXLOC etc. were
added?

(2) Is it necessary to continue the pointless restriction?

ANSWER:

(1) This was an oversight.

(2) No.  Edits are provided to remove it.
