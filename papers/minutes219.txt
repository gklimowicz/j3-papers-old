2. Opening business
    2.1 Introductory remarks from the Convenor
        Welcome to all attendees, and new members were introduced.
        John Reid will take the minutes for the WG5 portion of this
        meeting. The goal of this meeting is to reconcile feature lists.
        The US and Canada submitted a combined list.  The UK presented
        a list.  Japan produced a document, but no specific features.
        There will be a WG5-approved worklist produced, and it will not
        be open for additional feature requests.  In Berkeley we had a
        straw poll but that will not count for this purpose.
    2.2 Reminder of the ISO Code of Conduct
 https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/store/en/PUB100397.pdf
    2.3 Welcome from the Host
        Makki told us that there is a cafeteria here on campus.
        Wednesday's dinner will be in this building, and it will be an
        informal buffet party.  Please let Makki know by tomorrow how
        many will attend.
    2.4 Local arrangements
        Restrooms are on this floor.  There are drinks available in the
        next room.
    2.5 Appointments for this meeting
        John Reid is the head of the drafing committee, which includes
        Dan Nagle (US) Makki (Japan), John (UK), Daniel (Canada),
        Magne (Norway).
    2.6 Adoption of the Agenda
        Motion was made by Steve Lionel, seconded by Dan Nagle to accept
        the agenda, and motion passed with unanimous consent.

3. Matters arising from the Minutes of the Berkeley 2018 Meeting [N2158]
   (none)

4. Status of Berkeley Resolutions [N2152]
   Published Fortran 2018 in late November, 2018.

5. Reports
    5.1 SC22 Matters (Convenor)
        John reported on the TR/TS issue.  We voted to withdraw the TS's,
        (219113 and 18508) as they are now in Fortran 2018.  This has to
        go to SC22 for approval at the upcoming meeting in Korea.
        Steve to write a report for SC22, including the request for
        withdrawal of the two TS.
    5.2 National Activity Reports
              <<copy from John's paper>>
    5.3 Report from Primary Development Body (INCITS/PL22.3 Chair)
    5.4 Reports from other Development Bodies (Editors/Heads)

   Subgroup sessions started at 11:17, meeting resumed at 5:00
   and was in WG5 mode.
Steve Lionel led a walk-through of the UK and US feature lists with
the goal of constructing the WG5 work list for the next revision.
(Japan did not submit a specific feature request, but expressed the
general desire to keep the revision small (echoed by the UK) and to
favor features that benefited run-time performance.)

The following items were accepted, where the references should be
considered as preliminary:

UK01 - Extend procedure C_F_POINTER to allow a Fortran array pointer to
       have lower bounds other than 1. J3/19-194r1
US01 - Allow much longer statement lines and overall statement
       length. J3/19-138r1, J3/19-195
US02 - Require the processor to report cases where over-long lines or
       statements result in lost information. J3/19-149r1
US03 - SPLIT string intrinsic (original proposal was to keep all
       module intrinsics from the withdrawn Part 2 (ISO_VARYING_STRINGS).
       J3/19-196r3
US04 - Trig functions with arguments in degrees and arc versions with
       results in degrees. J3/19-203r1
US05 - Trig functions with arguments implicitly scaled by PI. J3/19-204r1
US06 - SELECTED_LOGICAL_KIND to return a KIND of logical based on its
       minimum storage size. J3/19-147r1
US07 - Additional named constants, LOGICAL8, LOGICAL16, LOGICAL32,
       LOGICAL64, in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV to specify KINDS supported for type
       LOGICAL. J3/19-139r1
US08 - Additional named constant, REAL16, in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV to specify
       whether the processor supports a 16-bit REAL KIND. J3/19-139r1
US09 - Intrinsics for converting between C strings and Fortran strings.
       J3/18-258r2
US10 - AT format editing specifier. Has the effect of TRIM on the
       corresponding character list item before output. J3/19-137r2
US11 - Control over leading zeros in output of REAL values. J3/19-156r1
US12 - Allow an array of a type that has an allocatable coarray
       component. J3/19-208r1 (Paper withdrawn for future rework.)
US13 - Syntax and semantics for a "Put with Notify" operation.
       J3/18-277r1
US14 - Allow deferred-length character variables in more locations,
       including as actual arguments corresponding to IOMSG and ERRMSG
       arguments for similar variables in specifiers.  Also allow for
       internal I/O. J3/18-279r1
US15 - SIMPLE procedures. A form of Super-Pure that disallows
       references to global data. J3/19-201r1
US16 - TYPEOF and CLASSOF type declarations to indicate the object being
       declared has the same type/class as another object. Useful to
       ensure a local variable in a procedure has the same type as a
       dummy argument, or that two dummy arguments have the same
       type. J3/19-142r1
US17 - Syntax to specify an element or section of an array with
       arbitrary rank. J3/19-150
US18 - Syntax for generic specification of rank and bounds of an
       object. J3/19-152r1
US19 - Protected components. J3/19-135r1
US20 - Reduction specifier for DO CONCURRENT. J3/19-198r2
US21 - Typed enumerators. J3/19-216r1
US22 - Conditional expressions. J3/18-274
US23 - Enhancements to BOZ constants. J3/19-211, J3/19-212r1. The full
       BITS proposal dropped from Fortran 2008 was not accepted.
US27 - Syntax to specify that the target of a dummy argument pointer is
       not to be changed (INTENT applies to the pointer, not its
       target) J3/18-144r1

The following requests were rejected:

US25 - Exceptions
US26 - Short-circuit logical operators. (Subsumed by US22 - if that gets
       dropped we may come back to this.)
US28 - Binary compatibility of C descriptors (to assist library writers.)
       No feasible implementation was suggested.

The following request was deferred:

US24 - Generics / templates / macros / containers for generic
       programming. WG5 recognizes that Fortran needs some sort of feature
       along this line but concluded that there was no general agreement
       on an approach and that it was too big a feature to include in this
       revision. WG5 resolved that work on such a feature would begin
       immediately, for inclusion in the following revision "202Y"
