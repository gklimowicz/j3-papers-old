Subject: Proposed post-DIS edits

This paper documents the edits that Richard Maine currently proposing to
apply after the DIS ballot.  The list might not be complete,
insomuch as the DIS ballot does not end until mid September.
(It would have been over by now if ISO hadn't taken 2 months to
start it).

No J3 action is required on this paper.  It is purely to
document current status, as the standard is likely to be out,
or at least in ISO's hands, before the November J3 meeting.

All of the currently proposed edits are purely typographical.

1. Edits for table 15.2 in c15.tex
     Replace line 419 by
        \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{}                           \\[-10pt]
        (making it the same as line 409).

     Replace the "|l|" at line 483 by "|p{5.625in}|".

2. Delete stray '"' at end of [367:35]

3. Change comma to period at end of [126:4]

4. [407:27] Change "index-name" to "<index-name>".
