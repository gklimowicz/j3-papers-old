Discussion
----------

In interp F18/040 in N2205 the sentence 
"If the coarray is an ultimate component of a dummy argument, the 
ultimate arguments on those images shall be declared with the same name 
in the same scoping unit and if in a recursive procedure at the same 
depth of recursion."
was passed for 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement. The words 
"and if in a recursive procedure at the same depth of recursion" at the 
end of the sentence were not included in N2203 (Corrigendum 2) or the DIS 
because something cannot be declared at a depth of recursion. However, in 
the case of unsaved local variable of a recursive procedure, the depth of 
recursion should be taken into account. An edit for the DIS is suggested. 


Edit to the DIS
----------------

In 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 4, at the end of the 
sentence 
"If the coarray is an ultimate component of a dummy argument, the 
ultimate arguments on those images shall be declared with the same name 
in the same scoping unit."
add 
"; if the ultimate argument is an unsaved local variable of a recursive 
procedure, the execution of the ALLOCATE statement shall be at the same 
depth of recursion of that procedure on every active image in the 
current team".
