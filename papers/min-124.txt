2.4  ISO Report
     Discussion Leader: Jeanne Martin
     References: 93-033,060,061
2.5  Adoption of the Final Agenda
     Discussion Leader: Jerry Wagener
     Action: To approve the agenda as modified (see section
             1 of these minutes); unanimous consent
2.6  Approval of Meeting 122 Minutes
     Action: To approve the minutes; unanimous consent
2.7  Approval of Meeting 123 Minutes
     Weaver: There are three items missing from the minutes:
              -- The use of action items described in 92-199
             was adopted.
              -- S20 items will no longer be renumbered.
              -- S20 items will now contain a date of last
             significant change.
     Hearing no objections, the minutes were amended to
             include these 3 items.
     Action: To approve the minutes as amended; unanimous
             consent
2.8  Review of the Action Items from Meeting 123
     Reference: 92-306
     1. Walt Brainerd:  Create list of edits for 1995
        revision.  List to be put in the distribution.

        Status:  Done -- See 93-008.

     2. Andrew Tait:  Make rules about the use of page and
        line numbers in S20.  A straw vote on whether they
        should appear was (21-0-3), so the rules should
        include the form and location of page and line
        numbers in S20.

        Status:  Pending -- Some changes made to the
        document, but no rules have been established.

     3. Jerry Wagener:  Check to see if the Secretariat has
        an email address that can be used for interpretation
        requests.

        Status:  Done -- See Jerry if you want the address.

     4. Jerry Wagener discuss with Andrew Tait:  The
        schedule for distribution of S20 after each meeting.
        Take into consideration the need to get ballot
        results in the premeeting.  Members want S20 in
        their hands for 4 weeks, but the ballot period could
        be shorter than 30 days.

        Status:  Done -- The letter ballot must run for 30
        days.  Every effort will be made to distribute S20 2
        weeks after the meeting.

     5. Andrew Tait:  Determine a method of identifying new
        items in S20 #0000 for subsequent ballots.

        Status:  Pending -- The plan was to create a new
        block within item 0000.  However, there were
        objections and this will be rethought.

     6. Andrew Tait:  Add a new field to S20 items to
        contain the date of the last significant change of
        an item (plus a comment).

        Status:  Done -- See current 93-006.

2.10 Treasurer's Report
     Discussion Leader:  Mallory North
     Reference: Minutes of meeting 123.

             meeting fee.
     Action: Passed by unanimous consent.
2.12 Object Orientation Presentation
     Discussion Leader: Denko Nebesh (DoD)
     Reference: 93-068
2.13 Comments from the Membership -- February 10
     Note that this was delayed until Tuesday due to lack of
             time.
     Steidel: Regarding X3J3 being a close liaison to
             X3J11.1 (NCEG), their chair asked that we
             designate someone to be a focal point and who
             can filter their mailings in order to
             distribute only the relevant items to the X3J3
             members.  [Jon ended up being that person.]
     Martin: When the results of the WG5 letter ballot are
             returned to us, the edits should be put in
             document order so that we can ensure that there
             are no collisions between them.  [An action
             item was created and assigned to Jerry Wagener
             to discuss this with Walt Brainerd.]
     Martin: Will we be able to leave the X3.9-1978
             references in when we forward this document to
             ISO?  [Several people felt that this should not
             be a problem as the interpretation is based on
             the current ISO document.  In addition, since
             we are charged with maintenance of both Fortran
             77 and Fortran 90 by ANSI, it makes sense to
             reference the Fortran 77 standard.  It was also
             felt that if the ANSI and ISO documents have to
             differ on this point, then so be it.]
3    Committee Action Items
3.1  JOR Procedures -- February 8
     Discussion Leader: Len Moss
     Moss:   There are two models for handling requirements:
              -- Establish a procedure similar to our
             interpretations processing,            i.e.,
             every submission is logged and tracked.
              -- Establish a procedure similar to that used
             for the development of            Fortran 90,
             i.e., a request is submitted and assigned to a
             subgroup      which can choose to bring it to
             the full committee or kill it.

3.18 Cross Language Questionnaire
     Discussion Leader: Jeanne Martin
     References: 93-022,033,054,060,067,089
     Martin: If these standards pass, X3J3 has work to do.
     Martin: X3J3 will do this work when it gets to it.  It
             can not delay other work.
     Wagener: From the discussion, it appears that we can
             say X3J3 strongly supports the answers that
             Jeanne proposed and will support WG5 in this
             work.
     Martin: I have to submit these by February 28, so if
             anyone has any input get it to me before then.
3.19 Document Processing
     Discussion Leader: Maureen Hoffert
     Hoffert: We should move to more electronic processing
             as opposed to paper processing.  The goal
             should be that anything which can feasibly be
             distributed in electronic form should be.
     Leonard: What format should be used?
     Answer: We are probably restricted to ASCII.
     Straw:  Should we move aggressively toward an
             electronic premeeting distribution with a
             secondary paper backup?  (9-0-4)
     Action: An ad hoc committee will be formed to study the
             electronic processing issue.
3.20 X3J3 Organization
     References: 93-014, 92-241
     A discussion will be held at the next meeting on the
             issue of creating an implementation subgroup.

4.1  Membership Report
     Hoffert: At this meeting 20 of our 31 members were
             either present of represented.  There were 22
             attendees and 1 guest.  At the close of this

             and 3 members are in jeopardy of losing their
             membership (Jim Himer, Alex Marusak, and Ivor
             Philips).
4.2  Future Meetings
     See section 7 of these minutes.
4.3  Agenda of Meeting 125
     Discussion: An initial discussion of the agenda was
             held.  All further suggestions should be sent
             to Maureen.
4.4  Treasurer's Report
     Secretary's Note: Due to technical difficulties (my
             email), the Treasurer's report was not
             available and will be included in the papers
             for meeting 125.
4.5  Action Items Review
     1. Andrew Tait:  Make rules about the use of page and
        line numbers in 006.  A straw vote on whether they
        should appear was (21-0-3), so the rules should
        include the form and location of page and line
        numbers in 006.

        Status:  Pending -- Some changes made to the
        document, but no rules have been established.
        Andrew did rule that in the text of the item page
        numbers were acceptable as they are part of the
        standard and line numbers are not acceptable as they
        are not part of the standard.  At issue still is the
        presence of line numbers in our internal version of
        the 006.

     2. Andrew Tait:  Determine a method of identifying new
        items in 006 #0000 for subsequent ballots.

        Status:  Pending -- The plan was to create a new
        block within item 0000.  However, there were
        objections and this will be rethought.

     3. Jerry Wagener discuss with Walt Brainerd:  When we
        get the 006 items back from the WG5 ballot, the
        edits contained in the items which passed should be
        put in document order to help ensure that there are
        no collisions between them.

        Status:  New

     4. Jerry Wagener discuss with Andrew Tait:  A subgroup
        field should be added to the 006 items.

        Status:  New

     5. Andrew Tait:  Provide a ruling on the format of
        titles in the 006 items.

        Status:  New
4.6  Comments from Members
     Bierman: I would like to give a vote of thanks to Bill
             and Doug.

     [The small group of people left then discussed how to
             handle the number of people leaving early.  It
             bothered most of the remaining people
             especially in light of the fact that the agenda
             was published with a 5:00 adjournment time.]
