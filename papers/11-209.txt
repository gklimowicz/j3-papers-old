1. Introduction

There is a contradiction between the description of SIZE in the plain
normative text in the TR and in the edit section.  A correction is
supplied.

For LBOUND, SIZE, and UBOUND, DIM cannot be present if ARRAY is
assumed-rank with rank zero, but the user has to deduce this from the fact
that 1<=DIM<=rank.  It seems more friendly to point this out, either by a
normative requirement or by a note.  Notes are supplied.


2. Edits to N1854

[5:27] "SIZE(ARRAY, I)" -> "SIZE(ARRAY, I, KIND)".
       append to paragraph
         "with KIND omitted from SIZE if it was omitted from SHAPE.".
{Normative text missing the optional KIND argument.
 Missing full stop at end of paragraph.}

[5:32] "SIZE(ARRAY, I)" -> "SIZE(ARRAY, I, KIND)".
{Normative test missing the optional KIND argument.}
