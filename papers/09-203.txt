While writing the papers on atomic semantics, I noted two points that
seem to need attention.  Neither should be controversial, but I may
have missed something.


The first is the current wording doesn't allow for compare-and-swap or
atomic addition, which we may want to add later.  The term "the
subroutine is executed" is already used in 12.5.4 with precisely the
right meaning.  A reference to that could be added if desirable.

[319:12-14] In 13.1, in paragraph 3, sentence 2, replace:

"as if the action on the ATOM argument occurs instantaneously"

by:

"as if the subroutine is executed instantaneously"


The second is that the atomic subroutines allow for an ATOM argument to
be any scalar of the right type and kind.  Not merely does that permit
copy-in/copy-out, an implementation may quite reasonably get unhappy if
a non-coarray is used.  I can think of no good reason to allow users to
play games with atomic subroutines.

[335:21] In 13.7.20, in paragraph 3, sentence 1, replace "scalar and"
by "a scalar coarray or coindexed object".

[335:35] In 13.7.21, in paragraph 3, sentence 1, replace "scalar and"
by "a scalar coarray or coindexed object".
