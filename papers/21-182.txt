Discussion
----------

I think I have found some glitches associated with enumeration type
in US 21. Edits are suggested.

Edits to 21-007r2
-----------------

[9:21] In 3.58 definition, after "(7.6.1)," add
"enumeration type (7.6.2)," so that the text reads
"<derived type (7.5.2), enumeration (7.6.1), enumeration type (7.6.2),
or procedure (15.6)> specification of the type, enumeration, or
procedure".

[36:17} In 5.3.2 Statement order, Table 5.1, under
"Derived-type definitions," add "Enumeration-type definitions,"

[91:21-23] In 7.6.2 Enumerations types, in para 4 R771 and in para 6,
change "int-expr" to "scalar-int-expr" thrice so that the text reads

"R771 enumeration-constructor is enumeration-type-spec (scalar-int-expr)

An enumeration constructor returns the value of the enumeration type
whose ordinal position is the value of the scalar-int-expr. The
scalar-int-expr shall have a value that is positive and less than or
equal to the number of enumerators in the enumeration type's
definition."

[92:NOTE 1 (cont). In 7.6.2 Enumerations types, NOTE 1,
subroutine wcheck, line 4, change "w 1" to "w1" so that the line reads
    Print *,'w1 selected'

[114:29] In 8.6.1 Accessibility statement, C874, after "derived type,"
add "enumeration type," so that the constraint reads
"C874 (R832) Each access-name shall be the name of a module, variable,
       procedure, derived type, enumeration type, named constant, or
       namelist group."

[201:28} In 11.1.9.2 Execution of a SELECT CASE construct, para 1,
item (1), change "integer or character" to "integer, character, or
enumeration type" so that the item reads
"(1) If the case value range contains a single value v without a colon,
a match occurs for type logical if the expression c .EQV. v is true,
and a match occurs for type integer, character, or enumeration type
if the expression c == v is true."
