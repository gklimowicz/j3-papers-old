Subject: definition of generic identifier
Date: 2017 October 12
Reference: 17-007r2

1. Discussion

The definition of "generic identifier" in the glossary conflicts with
the definition given in Clause 15.4.3.4.1 Generic identifiers.  The
glossary definition ([14:1-3] 3.79 generic identifier) uses the term
"lexical token", which implies only one lexical token.  The
definition in Clause 15.4.3.4.1 [306:9-307:1] includes cases that
require more than one lexical token. NOTE 15.9 [309] makes it clear
that the sequence of four tokens "ASSIGNMENT ( = )" is a generic
identifier.  The list of uses given in the glossary definition is
neither complete nor particularly useful.

A possible edit, based on the text in Clause 15.4.3.4.1, is provided.
A larger, but perhaps better, change might reference the syntax term
/generic-spec/.

2. Edit to 17-007r2

[14:3] 3.79 generic identifier
       Replace "lexical token ... assignments (15.4.3.4.1)" with
"lexical tokens that refer to a set of specific procedures (15.4.3.4.1)".
