From:     Richard Maine with edits by Interop/Meadows
Subject:  Pre-meeting editorial fixes

The following edits are copied from 02-191 with only one change. The
reference for the edit changing the bolding of Volatile was corrected
to be [85:4,6] rather than [81:4,6]

EDITS

  Fixed table numbering (was mixed up with note numbering).

  [55:3] Added missing space after "type."

  Added index entries for "numeric sequence type" and
  "character sequence type" in 5.5.1 and 16.4.3.3.

  "bindind" -> "bindings" in Note 4.48.

  [59:3] ", and" -> "; it"

  [60:2,23] Removed space in "<keyword> =" (4 times); otherwise it
  is confusing to parse.

  [84: last line of note 5.20] "this" -> "thus"

  [85:4,6] Bolded the instance of "VOLATILE attribute" on line 4
  instead of the one on line 6.

  [85:18] Added a comma.

  [91:9] Deleted extra "statement".

  [381:3] 6.5.5.3->6.7.5.3

  [105:18+] Hyphen changed to em-dash in last line of Note 6.4.
