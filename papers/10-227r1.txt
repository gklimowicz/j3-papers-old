If a Fortran procedure calls a C function that has a visible bind(c)
interface, and a dummy argument is TYPE(*) and assumed-shape (or any
other form that requires a pointer to a C descriptor be passed) then
there is likely insufficient information available to choose a valid
value for the type member of the descriptor.  A new Macro is added
that represents an unspecified type.

Edits to 10-165r2:
