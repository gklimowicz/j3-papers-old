Subject: Spurious defined terms in clause 13.
Date: 2009 February 05

1. Introduction
---------------

The system for "defining" terms we used in previous versions of the
standard is not in accordance with the ISO guidelines, so we need to stop
using it.  We have already introduced the ISO-compliant defined terms
subclause, and moved/copied many definitions into it.  However, quite a lot
have not been revised.  These should either
  - be turned into normal text ("untermified")
or
  - become proper defined terms.

This paper deals with the terms in clause 13.


2. Terms and what to do with them
---------------------------------

 - generic name: Already In Clause 12, Variation, Not A Definition;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - specific name: Not A Definition;
   = untermify, do not index.

Do we need to make "specific name" a proper defined term?


3. Edits to 09-007
------------------

OPTIONAL:
[Clause 1] Define term
  "\term{specific name}
   name that is not a generic name".
[throughout] Hyperlink "specfic name" as appropriate.

[321:19(13.1p5)] Unembolden "Generic names", do not index.

[321:20-21(13.1p5)] Unembolden "Specific names", do not index.
