In 07-157, Aleks writes:

UTI 081 on page 128 asks whether allocatable variables used as a MOLD
in ALLOCATE should be required to be allocated even if they don't
have deferred-type parameters and are not polymorphic.

The same question could be asked of POINTERs as well.

I propose that we keep things as they are, that is, according to
[128:10], pointers must be associated and allocatables allocated.

The rest of the UTI proposes adding a new feature, which seems
reasonable but is not really a technical problem so I do not address
it.
-------

Subgroup disagrees with the last paragraph.  We believe that 
126:26-28 and 128:12-14 do what the editor is asking about.  
The UTI can be deleted.
