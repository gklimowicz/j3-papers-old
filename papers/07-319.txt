Van asked in 07-245r1:

"[350:16] Should C1288 be replaced by adding "co-indexed object"
to the list in C1283?"

I believe the answer is yes. It does not change much since co-indexed
objects cannot participate in most of the list in C1288, but the
proposed change is more error-proof under future revisions.

Edits:

[334: 13] In C1280, before "or an object", add:
"is a co-indexed object,"

[334:30] Delete C1285
