Subject:   Editorial: EXTERNAL in INTERFACE body
Date: 2016 June 05
Reference: 16-007r1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION:

Consider the following code.

program main
  real ext, inval
  interface
    function ext1 (y)
      real ext1, y
      external ext1
    end function ext1 ! Duplicate EXTERNAL attribute
  end interface
  inval = 1.0
  print *, ext1(inval)
end program main

The EXTERNAL statement is allowed inside an interface body. However,
we have a constraint as:

[16-007: p118] C542 In an external subprogram, the EXTERNAL attribute
shall not be specified for a procedure defined by the subprogram.

It only mentions 'external subprogram'. Should it also include
interface body to be consistent?

ANSWER:

The code is not standard conforming. Edit is provided to clarify it.

EDITS to 16-007r1:

[16-007r1:p99] add a new constraint after C542

C542a In an interface body, the EXTERNAL attribute shall not be given
to the procedure other than the function-stmt or the subroutine-stmt.
