QUESTION:

Consider:

    MODULE TYPES
      ABSTRACT INTERFACE
        SUBROUTINE SUBROUTINE()
        END SUBROUTINE SUBROUTINE
      END INTERFACE
      TYPE PPS
        PROCEDURE(SUBROUTINE), POINTER, NOPASS :: SU_PTR
      END TYPE PPS
    END MODULE TYPES

    SUBROUTINE CPPS(PPA)
      USE TYPES
      TYPE(PPS), DIMENSION(:) :: PPA
      INTEGER I, J, N
      N = SIZE(PPA)
      DO I = 1, N
        CALL PPA(I)%SU_PTR()
      END DO
      PRINT *,((ASSOCIATED(PPA(I)%SU_PTR,PPA(J)%SU_PTR),I=1,N),J=1,N)
    END SUBROUTINE CPPS

    RECURSIVE SUBROUTINE OUTER(PPA)
      USE TYPES
      TYPE(PPS), DIMENSION(:) :: PPA
      INTERFACE
        SUBROUTINE CPPS(PPA)
          USE TYPES
          TYPE(PPS), DIMENSION(:) :: PPA
        END SUBROUTINE CPPS
      END INTERFACE
      IF (SIZE(PPA) .EQ. 3) THEN
        CALL CPPS(PPA)
      ELSE
        CALL OUTER( (/ PPA, PPS(INNER) /) )
      END IF
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE INNER()
        WRITE (*,*) 'SIZE(PPA) =', SIZE(PPA)
      END SUBROUTINE INNER
    END SUBROUTINE OUTER

    PROGRAM MAIN
      USE TYPES
      INTERFACE
        RECURSIVE SUBROUTINE OUTER(PPA)
          USE TYPES
          TYPE(PPS), DIMENSION(:) :: PPA
        END SUBROUTINE OUTER
      END INTERFACE
      TYPE(PPS),DIMENSION(0) :: PPA
      CALL OUTER(PPA)
    END PROGRAM MAIN

Does this program print all true values?

The procedure pointers are all associated with the internal procedure
INNER, which might lead one to believe that the answer is yes (that
is, they are all associated with the same target), but each procedure
pointer at each nesting level has a different host instance, which
might lead one to believe that the answer is no (and that therefore
only one of each of the 3-element sequences printed will be T).

ANSWER:

Four alternatives:
(1) No, the program does not print all true values; two procedure
    pointers to the "same" internal procedure are only associated
    if the host instances are also the same.

(2) Yes, the program does print all true values: two procedure
    pointers are associated if they point to the same procedure,
    the host instances of the pointers are immaterial.

(3) It is processor dependent which values are true, as it depends
    on the internal representation of the procedure pointers and this
    depends on the implementation technique.

(4) It is not meaningful to ask whether a procedure pointer is
    associated with a particular internal procedure.  The standard
    should forbid directly asking ASSOCIATED(pointer,internal), and
    it is not conforming for ASSOCIATED(ptr1,ptr2) when ptr1 and ptr2
    are associated with an internal procedure.

Awaiting decision as to direction.
