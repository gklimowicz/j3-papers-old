NUMBER: F08/0014
TITLE: Finalizing assignment to vector-subscripted object.
KEYWORDS: Finalization
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the program:

      Module m
        Type t1
          Real c
        Contains
          Final :: f11
        End Type
      Contains
        Subroutine f11(x)
          Type(t1),Intent(InOut) :: x(:)
          Print *,'f11 called'
          x%c = 0                              ! (*)
        End Subroutine
      End Module
      Program q
        Use m
        Type(t1) :: x(10) = t1(0)
        x( [1,4,9] ) = t1(1.5)
        Print *,x
      End Program

According to 6.5.3.2.2 Vector subscript,
  "An array section with a vector subscript shall not be ...
   argument associated with a dummy array that is defined or
   redefined ..."

Therefore the program above is not standard-conforming; however it
seems that deleting the assignment statement marked (*) would make the
program standard-conforming.

This seems to make final subroutines not useful when vector subscripts
are involved; either the finalization doesn't do anything to the
object in which case the vector subscript is allowed, or it does do
something (like deallocation) in which case the vector subscript is
disallowed.

Also, since passing vector-subscripted objects as actual arguments is
almost certainly going to pass a copy (and what's more a copy that
won't be copied back), this results in something other than the actual
entity being finalized - and this is possibly visible if pointers and
targets are involved.

Finally, these apparent violations of the standard are probably not
going to be detected on many processors, resulting in silent wrong
answers.  At least if vector subscripted sections being finalized were
rejected at compile time the user would stand a chance of avoiding
these problems.

Q. Is this analysis correct, and is this situation deliberate?

ANSWER:

A. The analysis is correct.  This should have been alleviated by
   allowing elemental procedures to modify vector-subscripted
   arguments.  An edit is supplied.

EDITS:

[124:7+] Insert new paragraph
  "A vector-subscripted array section shall not be finalized by a
   nonelemental final subroutine."

[295:8] In 12.5.2.4p18,
  After "If" insert "the procedure is nonelemental and".
