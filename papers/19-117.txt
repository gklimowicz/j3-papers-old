Subject: Coarrays of type TEAM_TYPE
Date: 2019-January-23


Discussion:
-----------
An object or a component of a derived type may not be a coarray of
type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. In 7.5.4.1
Component definition statement, constraint C747 on page 70 of
18-007r1 states:

  "If a coarray-spec appears, the component shall not be of type
   C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING, or of
   type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."

In 8.5.6 CODIMENSION attribute, page 95 we also have C824 which
states:

  "A coarray shall not be of type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the
   intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING, or of type TEAM_TYPE from the
   intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."

However, the description of the COARRAY argument to the THIS_IMAGE
intrinsic in 16.9.10 on page 421 states:

  "COARRAY shall be a coarray of any type. ... If it is of type
   TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, the TEAM
   argument shall appear."

The last sentence of the description of the COARRAY argument to the
THIS_IMAGE intrinsic is a relic left over from a time when objects
and components of type TEAM_TYPE could be coarrays.

An edit is provided to fix this issue.

  "If it is of type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module
   ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, the TEAM argument shall appear."
