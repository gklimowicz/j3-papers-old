From: John Reid
Subject: Interp F08/0048: sequence association for coarrays
Date: 2012 February 07

Tobias Burnus asked what was happening to this interp in an email
(July 18 last year), saying "For what it is worth. I concur with the
original 10-226: Namely that the current wording does not allow it -
but that it makes sense for consistency to allow it."

This is how it would be if we go back to 10-226. I append the text as
it appears in 11-006A. This includes arguments from Bill and me for
going back to 10-226 and support from Jim Xia.

NUMBER: F08/0048
TITLE:  Sequence association for coarrays
KEYWORDS: sequence association, coarrays
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Was the text in 12.5.2.8:
"If the dummy argument is an array coarray that has the CONTIGUOUS
attribute or is not of assumed shape, the corresponding actual argument
shall be simply contiguous."
intended to disallow sequence association for coarrays, as
illustrated by the example

   interface
      subroutine sub (x)
         real x(10)[*]
      end subroutine
   end interface
   ...
   real :: x(100)[*]
   ...
   call sub (x(10))

ANSWER:

No. This restriction contradicts 12.5.2.4 paragraph 13, which allows
the example program. An edit is supplied to correct this.

EDIT:

In 12.5.2.8 Coarray dummy variables, at the end of paragraph 2 [297:5],
add "or an element of a simply contiguous array".

As in 11-006A:

NUMBER: F08/0048
TITLE: Sequence association for coarrays
KEYWORDS: sequence association, coarrays
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Was the text in 12.5.2.8:
  "If the dummy argument is an array coarray that has the CONTIGUOUS
   attribute or is not of assumed shape, the corresponding actual
   argument shall be simply contiguous."
intended to disallow sequence association for coarrays, as illustrated
by the example

   interface
      subroutine sub (x)
         real x(10)[*]
      end subroutine
   end interface
   ...
   real :: x(100)[*]
   ...
   call sub (x(10))

12.5.2.4 paragraph 13 seems to imply that this ought to be valid.

ANSWER:

Yes, passing an array element to a dummy coarray was not intended to
use sequence association.  There is no contradiction with 12.5.2.4
paragraph 13 (which as is simply doesn't apply), but it is confusing
so an edit is supplied to clarify it.

EDIT:

[294:33] Append new sentence to 12.5.2.4 paragraph 13,
  "If the dummy argument is a coarray that is an array, the actual
   argument shall be an array."

** start of negative comments
  Bill Long's No vote on F08/0048:

    The proposed restriction on coarrays as actual arguments
    sequence associated with a contiguous dummy makes yet another
    exception to ordinary array behavior for coarrays. In this case,
    there seems to be no justification other than the view that sequence
    association of arguments is archaic. I think that the confusion
    introduced by making another case where coarrays are different from
    ordinary arrays is less desirable that allowing coarrays to behave
    like "old" arrays.

  John Reid's NO vote on F08/0048:

    Sequence association is allowed for array coarrays, so I can see no
    reason for disallowing it for a scalar coarray that is an element of
    a simply contiguous array.

    12.5.2.4 para 13 says: "If the actual argument is a noncoindexed
    scalar, the corresponding dummy argument shall be scalar unless the
    actual argument is default character, of type character with the C
    character kind (15.2.2), or is an element or substring of an element
    of an array that is not an assumed-shape, pointer, or polymorphic
    array."

    As the standard stands, I believe that this applies. It is made not
    to apply by the new edit: "If the dummy argument is a coarray that
    is an array, the actual argument shall be an array."

    I think this is a technical change that contradicts one of our design
    principles: wherever possible, coarrays should behave just like
    variables that are not coarrays.

    I suggest that we go back to 10-226 which contains the edit

      In 12.5.2.8 Coarray dummy variables, at the end of paragraph 2
      [297:9], add "or an element of a simply contiguous array".

  Jim Xia's No vote on F08/0048:

    I believe this restriction might be a bit surprising to users who
    regularly use sequence associations.  Also there isn't an apparent
    technical difficulties in support this.
