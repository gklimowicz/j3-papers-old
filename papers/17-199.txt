Discussion:
-----------

In subclause 18.5.5 the specifications for the CFI_* functions follow
a pattern of parts in the order

1 Synopsis.
2 Formal Parameters.
3 Description.
4 Result Value.
5 Example.

For the CFI_section the Description part is missing. However, text in
the description of the "result" formal parameter appears to be what
should be the Description part.

Edit to N2137:
--------------

[504:40+] In 18.5.5.7 The CFI_section function, following p3, insert a
new paragraph with the heading

"Description."

followed by the text at [504:18-29] in the Formal Parameters part that
reads

 "Successful execution of CFI_section ...
  ...
  If an error is detected, the C descriptor with the address result is
  not modified."

and remove the text at [504:18-29] from the description of the
'result' formal parameter.
