Subject: Edits to support decimal reals
References: Feature uk-002
--------------------------------------------------------------

Following are the edits to implement the uk-002 feature,
support for reals with decimal internal representation. It
adds a RADIX argument to selected_real_kind that allows
support for any positive radix, which could include 10. 

All page and line numbers refer to j3/04-007.


EDITS

.....................................................................

In the Introduction section (page xiii), the list of new Fortran 
2008 features should include

Radix specification for real kinds.

.....................................................................

In section 1.6 Compatibility, there are no changes needed.

.....................................................................

37:31-34.

Replace the last 2 sentences of the first paragraph of subsection 
4.4.2 with:

"The decimal precision, decimal exponent range, and radix of an
approximation method are returned by the intrinsic functions
PRECISION (13.7.90), RANGE (13.7.96), and RADIX (13.7.93). The
intrinsic function SELECTED_REAL_KIND (13.7.106) returns a kind
value based on spcified precision, decimal range, and radix
requirements."

.....................................................................

In subsection 13.7.106 describing the SELECTED_REAL_KIND intrinsic,
make these changes:

350:12.  replace the argument list with "([P,R,RADIX])"

350:13-14.  replace the Description with 

Returns a value of the kind type parameter of a real type with
decimal precision of a least P digits, a decimal range of at
least R, and a radix of RADIX.

350:18+.  add new argument:

RADIX (optional)   shall be scalar and of type integer

350:20 after the first sentence of Result Value, add a new sentence:

If RADIX is absent, the result value is the same as if it were 
present with the value RADIX(0.0).

350:21-29.  replace the current second sentence of the Result
Value section with:

The result has a value equal to a value of the kind type parameter
of a real type with decimal precision, as returned by the function
PRECISION, of at least P digits, a decimal exponent range, as
returned by the function RANGE, of at least R, and a radix, as
returned by the function RADIX, of RADIX, or if no such kind type
parameter is available on the processor, the result is -1 if the
processor does not support a real type with a precision greater
than or equal to P but does support a real type with an exponent
range greater than R and a radix equal to RADIX, -2 if the procssor
does not support a real type with an exponent range greater than
or equal to R but does support a real type with precision greater
than or equal to P and a radix equal to RADIX, -3 if the processor
supports no real type with either a precision greater than or equal
to P or an exponent range greater than or equal to R but does support 
a real type with a radix equal to RADIX, -4 if the processor supports 
real types with a precision greater than or equal to P and a decimal
range greater than or equal to R, but not together, and does support
a radix equal to RADIX, and -5 if the processor does not support a 
real type with a radix equal to RADIX.

.....................................................................

In subsection 14.10.17 describing the IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND 
intrinsic, make these changes:

378:4.  replace the argument list with "([P,R,RADIX])"

378:5-6.  replace the first sentence of the Description with: 

Returns a value of the kind type parameter of an IEEE real type 
with decimal precision of a least P digits, a decimal range of at
least R, and a radix of RADIX.

378:11+.  add new argument:

RADIX (optional)   shall be scalar and of type integer

378:13-17. replace the first sentence of Result Value with:

If P or R is absent, the result value is the same as if it were 
present with the value zero. If RADIX is absent, the result value 
is the same as if it were present with the value RADIX(0.0).
The result has a value equal to a value of the kind type parameter
of an IEEE real type with decimal precision, as returned by the 
function PRECISION, of at least P digits, a decimal exponent range, 
as returned by the function RANGE, of at least R, and a radix, as
returned by the function RADIX, of RADIX, or if no such kind type
parameter is available on the processor, the result is -1 if the
precision is not available for the specified radix and the radix 
is available, -2 if the exponent range is not available for the 
specified radix and the radix is available, -3 if neither the 
precision nor the exponent range is available for the specified
radix and the radix is available, and -5 if the radix is not 
available.
