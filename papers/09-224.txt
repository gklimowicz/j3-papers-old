Subject: Allow return back to a block
Date: 2009 May 05

Paper 09-176 remarks that, due to definitions
of "branch" and the prohibition of branching
into a block, technically, a program cannot
return to a block from a subprogram referenced
within a block.  The repair proposed in 09-176
involves changing the definition of branch,
and tracing the results of that change throughout
the standard.

Subgroup is reluctant to make so sweeping a change
at this date in the revision cycle, so a more modest
change is proposed to repair the defect.

Edits:

[170:20] (allow return from a subprogram
          referenced within a block)

In the first sentence,

Change: "prohibited." to
"prohibited, except by return from a subprogram
referenced within the block."
