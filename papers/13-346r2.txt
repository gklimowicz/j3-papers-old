---------------------------------

{Bill I11}: At [26:38+] In Note 4.48 in 4.5.6.2 The finalization
process of 10-007r1, we might need to add "in the current team" at the
end and consider rewording to avoid the word "event".
Response: The word "event" is used with its ordinary English meaning
many times in 10-007r1, particularly in 16. It would be inappropriate
to make a change just in this note. Edit provided for Note 4.48.

{John 1.1c}: The effect of SYNC ALL and SYNC TEAM in the presence of
failed images should be to synchronize the images that have not
failed. This should be stated.
Response: Edits for SYNC ALL and SYNC TEAM are provided in 13-340r1.
This is also an issue for ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE statements.
Edits are provided.

{Bill I12}: At [27:22+] We need an edit for the STAT= description in
6.7.4 similar to the new text in [28:28-36] to account for "current
team" and also STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.
Response:  Agreed. An edit is provided.

{John 1.1f}: The ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE statements should work in the
presence of failed images.  For locks and events, at most one other
image is involved and its failure must be regarded as an
error.
Response: The edits for {Bill I12} cover the ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE
cases.

{Bill I13}: At [27:27+] Does the exclusive execution of a CRITICAL
construct apply to all images of the initial team of images, or just
the current team? Probably the initial set (because it is usually used
to protect a global resource), but that should be clarified.
Response: It was intended that code developed without teams should run
unchanged on a team. Since two teams might be running such code at the
same time, CRITICAL should apply to the current team. Edits are
provided.

{Bill I14}: At [28:25,28,38] The new text in the edits for 8.5.7
includes the case of a STAT= specifier appearing on an END TEAM
statement, but there is no syntax for that. Note that the text at
[28:23-24] contains the "as an appearance both there and in the
corresponding END TEAM". This text has various ambiguities and needs
to be fixed, or specific syntax added for END TEAM.
Response: It is confusing to have an implicit <sync-stat-list> on the
END TEAM statement.  An edit is provided.

{Bill I15}: At [28:25-26] and [28:28-29] the EVENT POST and EVENT WAIT
statements are not included in the lists of statements that can set a
STAT= variable. This is an omission.
Response: Agreed. Edits are provided.

{Ed} [29:13-35]. Replace this set of edits by
{In 13.1 Classes of intrinsic procedures, insert the contents of 7.3
Collective subroutines of this Technical Specification after paragraph
3 and Note 13.1, with these changes:
Paragraph 2 of 7.3. Delete "of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010"
Paragraph 5 of 7.3. Add "(13.8.2)" after "ISO_FORTRAN_ENV" twice.}
Response: The words are intended to be identical apart from the
references.  Edit included below.

{Bill I16}: At [30:4-9] In the table entries for intrinsics we refer
to "all images" 5 times in reference to collectives. This needs the
"current team" fix.  Or just say "across images".
Response: Agreed. Edits are provided.

{Dan 10}: Add a section in the Edits to move the text in Annex A of
the TS to Annex C of 007.
Response: Agreed. This is similar to 9.12 in TS 29113. Edits are
provided.

{John 2.4}: More examples are needed, particularly of continued
execution in the presence of failed images.
Response: Agreed. An example is provided in 13-350.

Edits to N1983
--------------

[26:38+] {Bill I11} Add new section:
     "8.4a Edits to clause 4
     {In 4.5.6.2 The finalization process, add to the end of
     NOTE 4.48}
     in the current team"

[27:11] {John 1.1c} Change "images" to "nonfailed images".

[27:12] {John 1.1c} Change "images" to "nonfailed images".

[27:16] {John 1.1c} Change "images" to "nonfailed images".

[27:17] {John 1.1c} Change "images" to "nonfailed images".

[27:20] {John 1.1c} Change "images" to "nonfailed images".

[27:22+] {Bill I12} Add "{In 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, replace
    the text to the bullet list with} If the STAT= specifier appears
    in an ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement with a <coarray>
    <allocate-object> and an error condition occurs, the specified
    variable is assigned a positive value. The value shall be that of
    the constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module
    ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2) if the reason is that a failed image has
    been detected in the current team; otherwise, the value shall be
    that of the constant STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module
    ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2) if the reason is that a successful
    execution would have involved an interaction with an image that
    has initiated termination; otherwise, the value is a
    processor-dependent positive value that is different from the
    value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic
    module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2). In all of these cases each
    <allocate-object> has a processor-dependent status."
