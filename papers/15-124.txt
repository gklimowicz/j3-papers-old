Discussion
----------

In his recent ballot (see N2045) Malcolm Cohen wrote
"I do not agree with the syntax for specifying a team variable in an
image-selector, as we use double colons following type-specs and other
related attributes, which this is certainly not.  A single colon would
be acceptable."

We have considered both single and double colon notation.  The problem
with the single colon notation is that it visually looks like the
notation for an array section. While we currently don't allow
co-sections, it is a fairly obvious extension in the future. Earlier
coarray extensions had already allowed it.

In an email, Reinhold Bader wrote
"Alternatively, one could consider making the notation analogous to the
TEAM_ID one, say
    type(team_type) :: ancestor
    a[i, TEAM=ancestor] = ...
Some characters more to type in, but also more consistent."

We prefer this syntax and include edits here to implement it. As well
as being "more consistent", the meaning is obvious to the reader of
code - it does not rely on remembering the meaning of the double colon.
