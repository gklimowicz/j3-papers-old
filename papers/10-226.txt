Subject: F2008 interp re sequence association for coarrays
Date: 2010 October 07

NUMBER: F08/0048
TITLE:  Sequence association for coarrays
KEYWORDS: sequence association, coarrays
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Was the text in 12.5.2.8:
"If the dummy argument is an array coarray that has the CONTIGUOUS
attribute or is not of assumed shape, the corresponding actual argument
shall be simply contiguous."
intended to disallow sequence association for coarrays, as
illustrated by the example

   interface
      subroutine sub (x)
         real x(10)[*]
      end subroutine
   end interface
   ...
   real :: x(100)[*]
   ...
   call sub (x(10))

ANSWER:

No. This restriction contradicts 12.5.2.4 paragraph 13, which allows
the example program. An edit is supplied to correct this.

EDIT:

In 12.5.2.8 Coarray dummy variables, at the end of paragraph 2 [297:9],
add "or an element of a simply contiguous array".
