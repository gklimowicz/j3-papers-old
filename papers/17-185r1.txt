1. Discussion
=============

14.2.2p2 [297:1] says "a use-associated entity is considered to have
been previously defined."  We frequently use "previously declared"
without adding "or accessed by use or host association."  Hopefully, a
use-associated variable is considered to have been previously declared;
if it is, 14.2.2p2 should say so.  A similar explicit statement
concerning host association would be helpful.

Edits are proposed to make descriptions more consistent.

2. Edits
========

[297:1 14.2.2p2 The USE statement and use association] Before "A
use-associated" with "A use-associated variable is considered to have
been previously declared; any other use-associated" making the revised
sentence read

"A use-associated variable is considered to have been previously
declared; any other use-associated entity is considered to have been
previously defined."

[518:1 19.5.1.4p1 Host association]  Before "In the case..." insert a
sentence "A host-associated variable is considered to have been
previously declared; any other host-associated entity is considered to
have been previously defined."
