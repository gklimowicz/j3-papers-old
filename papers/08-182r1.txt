TITLE: Separators in list-directed output involving UDDTIO
KEYWORDS: list-directed output, separators, UDDTIO
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m
  TYPE t
    INTEGER i
  END TYPE
  INTERFACE WRITE(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedWriteT
  END INTERFACE
CONTAINS
  SUBROUTINE formattedWriteT(dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(t),         INTENT(IN)    :: dtv
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: unit
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: v_list(:)
    INTEGER,          INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

    WRITE(unit, *) dtv%i, 'a'
  END SUBROUTINE
END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  TYPE(t) :: t1 = t(5)
  OPEN(10, FILE='foo.txt', ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL', FORM='FORMATTED', &
       DELIM='NONE')
  WRITE(10, *) 'xyz', t1, 'zyx'
END PROGRAM

10.9.2 of Fortran 2003 states that character sequences produced for
list-directed output are not separated from each other by value
separators when the delimiter mode is NONE.  The implication of this
is obvious when the adjacent effective output list items are both of
character type.  But when user-defined derived-type input/output
is involved, it is much less clear whether a separator should be
included in the output.

In the example given, it is unclear whether the output should be:
 xyz 5 azyx
or:
 xyz 5 a zyx

1. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when one of the character sequences is written by a child
   data transfer statement, and the other is written by a parent data
   transfer statement, where both statements are list-directed?

2. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when the character sequences are written by two different
   child data transfer statements, where both statements are
   list-directed?

3. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   one of the character sequences is written by a child data transfer
   statement, and the other is written by a parent data transfer
   statement, where one of the statements is list-directed and the
   other is format-directed?

4. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   the character sequences are written by two different child data
   transfer statements, where one of the statements is list-directed
   and the other is format-directed?

There is also the further question of whether, in the case of
recursive i/o, this is affected by intervening i/o operations to a
different unit.  For example, in the modified program:

    MODULE m2
     TYPE t
       INTEGER i
     END TYPE

     INTERFACE WRITE(FORMATTED)
       MODULE PROCEDURE formattedWriteT
     END INTERFACE

    CONTAINS

     SUBROUTINE formattedWriteT(dtv,unit,iotype,v_list,iostat,iomsg)
       CLASS(t),         INTENT(IN)    :: dtv
       INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: unit
       CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
       INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: v_list(:)
       INTEGER,          INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
       CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

       CHARACTER(100) temp

       WRITE (temp,'(I0)') dtv%i
       WRITE (unit,*) TRIM(temp)
     END SUBROUTINE

    END MODULE

    PROGRAM foo2
     USE m2
     TYPE(t) :: t1 = t(5)

     OPEN(10, FILE='foo.txt', ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL', &
          FORM='FORMATTED', DELIM='NONE')
     WRITE(10, *) 'xyz', t1, 'zyx'

    END PROGRAM

5. Does the second example write
     xyz 5xyz
   or
     xyz5xyz

   That is, in this case, does the data transfer which is an internal
   file write affect whether 'xyz' and TRIM(temp) are adjacent?

6. Similarly, if the outer list-directed WRITE were to an internal file
   does an intervening external file i/o operation affect whether the
   character sequences are considered adjacent (i.e. the opposite way
   around to the second example)?

ANSWER:

1) No. It is the intent of the standard (10.9.2) that when both the
   parent and child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both are namelist output statements, the
   processor treats the first list item appearing in a child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately
   followed the last list item processed by the parent data
   transfer statement, as long as no other data transfers to that
   unit occurred in between the processing of those two list items.
   Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences are
   considered adjacent.

2) No. It is the intent of the standard (10.9.2) that when two
   different child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both namelist output statements, they write
   to the same unit, and no other data transfers to that unit occur
   in between the two child data transfer statements, the processor
   treats the first list item appearing in the second child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately followed
   the last list item processed by the first child data transfer
   statement.  Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences
   are considered adjacent.

3) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  In section 10.9.2, the
   phrase "adjacent undelimited character sequences" refers to
   character sequences produced by list-directed output.  When one of
   the sequences is written by a child or parent output statement
   that is not list-directed, the exception described in the first
   paragraph of 10.9.2 does not apply. The other rules for inserting
   optional blanks around values in list-directed output allow the
   processor to insert optional leading and trailing blanks around a
   list item.  The standard does not specify when optional blanks are
   written; therefore, when two adjacent list items (the values
   thereof) are written to an output record, and only one of them was
   written by list-directed input/output, the standard does not
   specify whether or not any optional blanks appear between those
   values in the output record.

4) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  See answer 3.

5) The result should be "xyz5xyz", that is, the recursive i/o to the
   internal file does not affect whether the character sequences being
   written by the outer data transfer statement are considered
   adjacent.

6) No, if an outer data transfer is to an internal file, then a
   recursive i/o operation to a different internal file or an external
   file does not affect whether the character sequences are considered
   adjacent.

NOTE TO J3:

In Fortran 2008, recursive i/o operations to a different external unit
are allowed and these also ought not to affect whether the character
sequences written by the outer data transfer statement are considered
to be adjacent.  The edit to F2003 below will produce that result when
applied to the (draft) F2008.

EDITS:

[241:5] In Section 10.9.2, add the following to the end of the
        first paragraph:
  "Two undelimited character sequences are considered adjacent when
   both were written using list-directed input/output, no intervening
   data transfer or input/output file positioning operations on that
   unit occurred, and both were written either by a single data
   transfer statement, or during the execution of a parent data
   transfer statement along with its child data transfer statements."
