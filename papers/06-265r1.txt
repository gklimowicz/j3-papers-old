Discussion of issue 59 (page 348)

The two uses of THIS_IMAGE are related in that they both return
information specific to the executing image. In one case, it is the list
of co_subscripts corresponding to the image. In the other, it is the
image index.  This usage in currently implemented on some compilers
and has not confused users to date.  

Edit to J3/06-007

None.
