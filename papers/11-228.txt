Notes:
------

1.  J3 has been renamed from INCITS/J3 to INCITS/PL22.3.  In
    these minutes, the committee will be referred to as J3.

2.  WG5 sessions were chaired by John Reid, the WG5 convenor.  J3
    sessions were chaired by Dan Nagle, the J3 chair.

    "** /WG5 **" marks a WG5 section of the meeting;  "** /J3 **"
    marks a J3 section of the meeting.

3.  The WG5 draft minutes were expertly prepared by David Muxworthy and
    can be found in N1860.  Various WG5 discussions were so
    diplomatically summarized therein that these minutes quote N1860
    when the J3 secretary deemed it prudent.

4.  These J3 moinutes were reconstructed from notes graciously
    provided to the secretary by Bill Long.  Any errors or omissions
    in these moinutes are the secretary's fault alone.

2. Opening business
2.1 Introductory remarks from the Convenor
The convenor said that the main objectives of the meeting were to
complete the technical report on further interoperability with C
and to process interpretations for Fortran 2008.  Developments on
coarrays should have lower priority.

2.2 Welcome from the Host
Reinhold Bader welcomed participants to LRZ. [...]

2.3 Local arrangements [...]

2.4 Appointments for this meeting
The drafting committee would be Reinhold Bader, Toon Moene,
David  Muxworthy (chair), Van Snyder, Masayuki Takata and Jim Xia.
David  Muxworthy would act as secretary and John Reid as librarian.

5. Reports
5.1 SC22 Matters (Convenor)
The convenor drew attention to his report of the 2010 SC22 meeting
(N1837).  It was noted that part 3 of the Fortran standard (Conditional
Compilation) had now been withdrawn.  Part 2 (Varying Length Strings)
was a potential candidate for deletion in the future.

5.3 Report from Primary Development Body (INCITS/PL22.3) [...]

5.4 Reports from other Development Bodies (Editors/Heads) [...]

5.5 Liaison Reports:
INCITS/PL22.11 (C): Craig Rasmussen
WG14 had welcomed an earlier copy of the Interoperability TR and were
particularly interested in the examples.  It was agreed that a copy of
the latest draft should be sent to WG14 for comment.

MPI: Craig Rasmussen
No report, in view of presentation by Rolf Rabenseifner on Tuesday (see
below).

UPC:  Dan Nagle
No information was to hand.

IFIP/WG2.5: Van Snyder
There were to be meetings of WG2.5 in Boulder in August and in Spain in
July 2012.  They were cooperating with IEEE on arithmetic.

OpenMp: Matthijs van Waveren
No information was to hand.  The convenor would contact Matthijs van
Waveren to ask if he was willing to continue as liaison.  Concern was
expressed that OpenMp 3.1 showed lack of awareness of Fortran
developments.

WG23 (Vulnerabilities): Dan Nagle
WG23 proposed to update their TR (TR 24772) in September and thereafter
produce annual revisions.  There would be language-specific annexes for
Ada, C and SPARC; a potential draft for a Fortran annex had been
prepared.

           [Reid] (Snyder/Cohen) as amended: uc {post r2}

   Paper N1847 "Result of WG5 letter ballot on N1845" proposes to do
     nothing as a reply paper.  N1848 " Edits made to N1845 based on
     results of Ballot N1846 31May2011" is an adequate response.
     N1848: no action from JOR

** /WG5 ** << begin N1860 - WG5 minutes excerpts >>

Attention was drawn to the fact that withdrawal of part 2 of the
Fortran standard (N1375) would remove five intrinsic character
functions (in subclause 3.7 of that standard) which were not provided
in Fortran 2008.  This would be for discussion later in the week.
[This was item 11 on the WG5 agenda; thereafter item 11 matters were
considered as appropriate throughout the meeting]

There was a discussion on whether WG5 should produce a standard on
interfaces to certain mathematical functions, analogous to those for C
(ISO/IEC 24747:2009) and C++ (ISO/IEC 29124:2010).  The resulting straw
vote was: 0 yes - 5 no - 8 undecided.  [This was item 10 on the WG5
agenda]

There was a discussion on whether WG5 was in favour of there being a
Fortran annex to the TR on vulnerabilities (TR 24772).  WG23 would
accept input on Fortran only if it had been approved by WG5.  After
consideration the straw vote was:  8 yes - 1 no - 4 undecided.  It was
]decided to aim
for incorporation of the annex in the September 2012 revision of the TR,
which depended on WG23 adhering to their current schedule.  Dan Nagle,
John Reid, David Muxworthy and Makki Takata agreed to participate in the
development.  A mailing list would be set up.  [This was item 9 on the
WG5 agenda]

** /WG5 ** << being N1860 excerpts>

The proposals, in 11-193r1, to make changes to the coarray collective
procedures in the draft coarray TS were discussed with a view to
obtaining WG5's opinion.  The debate was adjourned to Friday.

The matter of the five intrinsic character functions (above) was raised
again and was referred to subgroup for a recommendation.

The convenor drew attention to a draft of a new strategic plan with a
view to consideration the following day.

** /WG5 ** << begin N1860 excerpts >>

The first draft of the new strategic plan for WG5, N1859, was discussed.
The committee's main concerns were that this gave insufficient time for
scrutiny of public comments on the interoperability TR and that the
further coarray TR (now a TS) was proceeding without objectives or
requirements being adequately specified.  The plan was withdrawn for
revision.

   /J3

     The list of papers for voting, discussion, or action later in
     the week was discussed.

** /WG5 ** << begin N1860 excerpts >>

A revision of the strategic plan, N1859, was discussed.  This gave two
alternatives for the schedule for the Interoperability TR according as
whether an extension to the time limit could be obtained.  Extensions
were granted by SC22 in units of one year but it would be intended to
use only four months.

7. Consider the technical content of the proposed TR on Further Coarray
   Features.
There was a discussion on a draft requirements paper for the further
coarray feature TS {N1858 == 11-176, N1863}.  A straw vote on whether
the requirements should include parallel input/output went:
  2 yes - 1 no - 12 undecided.
The main discussion was on the need to specify objectives.

** /J3 ** << end N1860 >>

5. Friday, July 1, 2011  9:00 am
--------------------------------

** /WG5 ** << begin N1860 excerpts >>

A draft of the resolutions (N1861) was discussed and minor changes made.
A resolution on varying length strings was added: it was agreed that the
convenor would write and make publicly accessible an updated version of
the ISO_VARYING_STRING module.  This would mean that if or when part 2
of the Fortran standard were withdrawn, those character intrinsic
functions which were in part 2 but not in part 1 would still be
generally available.

There was a discussion on the draft requirements document for the
further coarray facility TS (N1863).  This centred on the need for
defined objectives for the project and the extent to which the
content should be based on the current draft in N1858 which was in
turn based on resolution LV5 from 2008.  A straw vote on whether to
restrict the content essentially to N1858 was:  0 yes - 7 no -
4 undecided.

The approach outlined in N1863 was therefore abandoned in favour of a
plan outlined in N1859 which allowed for a public trawl for
requirements, followed by specification of aims and objectives and
selection of features by PL22.3 and WG5.  This, with time scales, is
summarized in resolution G10 and section 3 of the final version of the
new strategic plan (N1859).

Changes were made to the draft resolutions to accommodate the above
decision and further minor edits to the resolutions were suggested.

Reinhold Bader gave a tutorial on coscalars, which was followed by
discussion.  The slides are in document N1864.

5.5 Treasurer's report - Van Snyder

   18 Feb 2011 Closing balance                    $ 2893.13
   27 Feb 2011 Meeting fees                            0.00
   01 Jul 2011 Expenses                                0.00

   01 Jul 2011 Closing balance                    $ 2893.13

   Outstanding obligations: none

   There was a motion at m194 to suspend the meeting fee for the m195
   meeting only:

     "suspend the meeting fee for the June-2011 meeting"

   Therefore the meeting fee for m196 will be $50.

   The Treasurer's Report is in paper 11-226

WG5 records its intent to submit to SC22 a first Technical Corrigendum
for Fortran 2008 before the end of September 2011.

G6.  Varying Length Strings
In order to prepare for eventual withdrawal of part 2 of the Fortran

modern version of the ISO_VARYING_STRING sample module and to make it
available on the WG5 website.

G7. Content and processing of the Interoperability TR 29113
