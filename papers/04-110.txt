Subject: S= on Epsilon(), RRSpacing(), Spacing()


An implementations of real numbers where using an exponent
and mantissa format (corrsponding to the Fortran model),
epsilon, rrspacing and spacing may depend upon the direction
as well as the origin of the request.  Therefore, add
a S= parameter to these intrinsics.

Title: S= on EPSILON, RRSPACING, SPACING

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: Sections 13.7.35, 13.7.100, 13.7.113

Basic Functionality: Add direction to epsilon, rrspacing, spacing

Rationale:  At those numbers where one step causes an exponent to change,
            the step size changes, too.  This information should be
            available to those programs needing it.  The nearest and
            ieee_nextafter procedures accept a direction argument,
            S= (s for sign, I suppose) to signal the direction
            in which the request is being made.  This ability should
            be available to programs calling epsilon, rrspacing and spacing
            as well.

Estimated Impact: No other procedures will be affected.
                  There is some cost to determining the requested delta,
                  but not more than in implementing these procedures
                  in the first place.

Detailed Specification: Add "[, S= s-r-e ]" to epsilon, rrspacing, spacing.
                        Add language similar to that in nearest():

                        "The result has a value equal
                        to the <requested-quantity>
                        in the direction of the infinity
                        with the same sign as S."
