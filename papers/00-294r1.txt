We need some words in the intro about the new i/o stuff.

EDITS:

xvi:25-27 replace j3 note 209 with (new paragraph):
Section 9 also describes the new features of asynchronous input/output,
user defined derived type input/output procedures, and the stream access
method.  Asynchronous input/output allows a program to continue
processing while the processor
satisfies an input/output transfer.  User defined derived type data transfer
procedures allow a user to override the defaults for transferring
data represented as variables of user defined derived types.  The
stream access method allows data to be transferred a file storage unit
sequence between internal storage and external files.
