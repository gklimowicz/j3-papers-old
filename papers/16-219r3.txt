An IMPORT statement is now permitted to appear in the
specification part of a submodule, as well as in module
and internal subprograms.

Edit:

[34:8+6] 2.3.2 Statement order,
         Table 2.2: Statements allowed in scoping units,
         IMPORT row, "Module or submodule" column,
           "No" -> "Submodule".
         "Module subprogram" and "Internal subprogram" columns,
           "No" -> "Yes".
