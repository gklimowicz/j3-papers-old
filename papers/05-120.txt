Subject: Raise then enable halting => halt?   

NUMBER:  F03/0041
TITLE:  IEEE halting and exceptions
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, trapping, exception
DEFECT TYPE:  ???
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

If a specific Floating-Point (FP) exception flag is raised, and
then HALTING for that FP exception is enabled for the first
time, does the program halt?  Or, must the specific FP exception
happen after the halting is enabled for the program to halt?
Section 14.5 [368:1-8] does not answer the question.
