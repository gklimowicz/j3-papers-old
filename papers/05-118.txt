TITLE:  HYPOT()
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, hypot()
DEFECT TYPE:  ???
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

What is HYPOT(NaN,infinity)? HYPOT(NaN,finite)?

DISCUSSION:

HYPOT(X,Y) when X and/or Y is an infinity (even if the other is
a NaN) shall be +infinity.  Reason: hypot(), when one of the
arguments is an infinity, is +infinity independent of the
value of the other argument.  So, if the NaN argument is
replaced by zero, any finite number, or any infinity,
hypot(infinity,NaN) is still infinity.

HYPOT(X,Y) when X and/or Y is a NaN (and neither is infinite)
shall be a NaN, and should one of the NaN arguments.
