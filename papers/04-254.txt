Title:                File Sharing Modes

Submitted By:    Craig Dedo

Status:            For Consideration

Basic Functionality:
    The new standard should allow for the specification of file sharing 
modes.  The file sharing specifier should allow the programmer to 
specify any of the four sharing modes:
* Exclusive use by this unit
* Reading by others, but not writing
* Writing by others but not reading
* Permit full access by others

Rationale:
    Currently, there is no facility for file sharing in the Fortran 
standard.  Some processors already provide this capability but there are 
widely varying implementations.  Some implementations do not allow 
specification of all four sharing modes.  The ability to specify file 
sharing modes would allow Fortran developers to support frequently 
accessed multi-user data bases on time-sharing systems or local area 
networks.  With the growing complexity of software and the growing 
numbers of networked desktop PCs, there will be a large demand for 
simultaneous access to complex data bases.

Estimated Impact:
    There should be no impact on exiting codes.  Processors which 
already provide this capability in a non-standard manner will have to 
develop the support for the standard syntax.

Detailed Specification:
    The best method would be to allow for a second specification in the 
character expression that follows the ACTION= keyword, in the same 
manner that Lahey Fortran does.  In the character expression, the access 
mode specifier and sharing mode specifier would be separated by a 
comma.  Either one could come first. 

    Alternatively, there could be a separate keyword, such as SHARE or 
something similar.

    The sharing mode specifier could have one of these four values, with 
the indicated actions:

Sharing Mode Keywords    Action

NONE        For exclusive use by this unit in this process
READONLY    Allows reading by others, but not writing
WRITEONLY   Allows writing by others, but not reading
READWRITE   Allows others to open the file for both reading or writing
