The atomic subroutines allow for an ATOM argument to be any scalar of
the right type and kind.  Not merely does that permit
copy-in/copy-out, an implementation may quite reasonably get unhappy
if a non-coarray is used.  I can think of no good reason to allow
users to play games with atomic subroutines.

[335:21] In 13.7.20, in paragraph 3, sentence 1, replace "scalar and"
by "a scalar coarray or coindexed object".
