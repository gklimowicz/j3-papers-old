Subject: TS 29113: Changes made to N1885 to create N1904
Date: 2012 February 16
References: WG5/N1885, WG5/N1890, WG5/N1895


The goal of this paper is to produce a final version of WG5/N1905 that
documents the changes made to the initial DTS draft.

-------------------------------------------------------


                                       ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5 N1905

             Changes to N1885 to create N1904

                         Bill Long


WG5 document N1885 was the initial candidate DTS for TS 29113, Further
Interoperability of Fortran with C. An informal WG5 Ballot, N1890,
resulted in comments documented in N1895. Those Ballot comments and
additional comments resulting from email discussions on the interop-tr
email list and the j3 email list resulted in comments included in this
document. Additional changes included arose from these papers passed
at J3 meeting 197:

J3/12-111r2
J3/12-123r2
J3/12-130r2
J3/12-137r1

The accumulation of these changes applied to N1885 resulted in an
updated DTS candidate document WG5/N1904.  Edit citations refer to
N1885.

The comments are divided into two groups:

I) Comments that resulted in changes
II) Comments that did not result in changes

Comments include either a J3 paper number or the name of the commenter
and source of the comment. The commenters are:

Bill:      Bill Long,      Cray Inc. (USA) (TS editor)
John:      John Reid,      RAL       (UK)  (WG5 Convener)

Some comments include explanatory text enclosed in { }.

------------------------------------------------------------

I) Comments that resulted in changes:
=====================================


1) Van: (22-oct-2011 email)

In Foreword p4 "accepted" should be "accepted".

-------------

2) Bill: (Editorial)

In Foreword, final para, change "29113:2011" to "29113:2012".

-------------

3) Bill (Editorial)

5.1 Assumed-type objects, move the sentence "An assumed-type object is
unlimited polymorphic." from just before Note 5.1 to the end of the
paragraph just before constraint C407a.

-------------

4) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 1 of 26 from N1895)

5.1p3 Note 5.2: Replace "within Fortran code" by "for a Fortran
procedure".

------------

5) Bill: (Editorial)

5.2 Assumed-rank objects, in Note 5.3, last sentence, replace "must"
with "should". {Use of "must" is discouraged, even in Notes.}

------------

6) Robert: (Ballot comment 1 of 3 from N1895 [partial])
John: (23-jan-2012 email), Malcolm (25-jan-2012 email)

5.4.1: delete "initiated ... C"

{Potentially conflicts with "defined by means other than Fortran" in
5.4.2p1. Addresses first para of Ballot comment 1.}

------------

7) John: (26-jan-2012 email, Ballot comment 1 of 6 from N1895)

6.3 Argument association:

Replace the third sentence of para 1, "If the actual argument is an
array ... assumed from the actual argument." with

"If the actual argument is an array, the rank and extents of the dummy
argument are assumed from the actual argument, including the lack of a
final extent in the case of an assumed-size array. If the actual
argument is an array and the dummy argument is allocatable or a pointer,
the bounds of the dummy argument are assumed from the actual argument."

{The bounds are assumed only for the allocatable and pointer cases.}

And, delete the fourth sentence of para 1. "The values of the lower
... specified."

{In the allocatable and pointer cases, the sentence does not say
anything. For the other cases, the sentence contradicts the convention
of setting the lower bound to zero.}

{The final wording of the edits varies from those suggested in the
original ballot comment.}

------------

8) Van: (12-137r1)

[6.3p3] "If" should be "When"

------------

9) Bill: (Editorial),  Malcolm: (23-jan-2012 email)

6.4 Intrinsic procedures:

    In 6.4.1 Shape, line 3 change "a value of" to "a value equal to".
    In 6.4.2 Size, lines 2 and 5, change "a value of" to
                   "the value" twice.
    In 6.4.3 Ubound, line 3 change "a value of" to "a value equal to".

{Change wording to match style of F2008 intrinsic descriptions.
The edits in 9.8 do not use "a value of", so no changes there.}

------------

10) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 5 of 26 from N1895)

6.4.3p1: After "result" insert "of UBOUND(ARRAY,RANK(ARRAY),[KIND])".

{The array constructor brackets, [ ], around KIND were removed and
spacing added to match the style of the LBOUND ref later in the
sentence.}

-----------

11) Bill: (12-130r2)

In 7.2 RANK, The example does not really make clear why this function
is needed. Replacing the existing sentence by

"If X is a dummy argument declared with REAL X(..) and is argument
 associated with an effective argument that was declared REAL
 Y(:,:,:), RANK(X) has the value 3."

-----------

12) Van: (21-oct-2011 email)

In 8.1p1 and 8.1p2, "must" ought to be "shall".

-----------

13) Bill (12-111r2)

In the title for 8.1, replace "C_F_POINTER, ... C_FUNLOC" by
"ISO_C_BINDING module procedures"

-----------

14) Bill: (12-111r2)

In 8.1 after paragraph 1 add new paragraph:

 "The function C_F_PROCPOINTER from the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING
  has the restriction in ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 that CPTR and FPTR shall
  not be the C address and interface of a noninteroperable Fortran
  procedure."

-----------

15) Bill: (12-111r2)

In 8.1 after the final paragraph add a new paragraph:

  "If the value of a C function pointer will be the result of a reference
   to C_FUNLOC with a noninteroperable argument, it is recommended that the
   C function pointer be declared with a prototype of
   \cf{void (*funptr_name)()}."

-----------

16) John: (26-jan-2012 email)

8.2 C descriptors: Replace the second sentence "The C descriptor ... a
C function." with

"The C descriptor along with library functions with standard
prototypes provides the means for describing within a C function an
allocatable or data pointer object, a nonallocatable nonpointer data
object of known shape, or an assumed-size array."

-----------

17) Bill: (12-123r2; partly replaces edit above)

8.2 C descriptors:

In the second sentence, change

"a nonallocatable nonpointer data object of known shape, or an
assumed-size array"

to

"or a nonallocatable nonpointer object that is scalar or is an
assumed-shape, explicit-shape, or assumed-size array".

{The term "known shape" is not defined and the list of alternatives
using defined terms is short. Ed: Corrected the edit from the paper,
which had an extra "array of" before "assumed-shape".}

-----------
18) Van: (12-137r1)

[8.3.1] Sometimes "ISO_Fortran_binding.h" is a header and sometimes a
file.  In p1, "file" -> "header file".  In p3, "header
ISO_Fortran_binding.h" -> "ISO_Fortran_binding.h header file".

-----------

19) John: (28-jan-2012 email)

8.3.2 CFI_dim_t, description of "extent": At the end of the sentence
add ", or the value -1 for the final dimension of an assumed-size
array".
{Allow for the special value for assumed-size final dimension.}

-----------

20) Van: (12-137r1)

[8.3.3 "base_addr"] Need a noun after "allocatable". Insert "variable"
after "allocatable".

-----------

21) John/Bill: (27-jan-2012 email)

8.3.3: In the description of the attribute member: Replace
"allocatable, assumed-shape, assumed-size, or a data pointer" with
"allocatable, a data pointer, or a nonallocatable, nonpointer data
object".

-----------

22) Bill: (17-jan-2012 email)

8.3.3: In the para following the dim[] description, the current text
does not cover all of the possible arrays that are represented by a C
descriptor.  Replace the current paragraph "For a C descriptor of an
assumed-shape...is the Fortran lower bound." with:

"For a C descriptor of an array pointer or allocatable array, the
value of the lower_bound member of each element of the dim member of
the descriptor is determined by argument association, allocation, or
pointer association. For a C descriptor of a nonallocatable nonpointer
object, the value of the lower_bound member of each element of the dim
member of the descriptor is zero."

-----------

23) Bill: (11-dec-2011 email)

8.3.3, last para before Note 8.1, change "-2" to "-1" as the extent
member value for an assumed-size array. {Make this consistent with the
SIZE modification on page 14.}

-----------

24) Bill/John: (8-jan-2012 email, 26-jan-2012 email)

8.3.4 Macros, in Table 8.1 Macros specifying attribute codes,
replace the entry for CFI_attribute_assumed with

"CFI_attribute_other    nonallocatable nonpointer"

{This macro corresponds to more than just assumed-shape arrays. Edit
is needed independent of the unknown_size issue.}
{Part of edits to remove CFI_attribute_unknown_size}

-----------

25) Bill/John: (8-jan-2012 email)

8.3.4 Macros, in Table 8.1 Macros specifying attribute codes, delete
the last entry "CFI_attribute_unknown_size | assumed size".
{Part of edits to remove CFI_attribute_unknown_size}

-----------

26) Bill: (Editorial)

8.3.4 Macros, in Table 8.1 Macros, reorder the entries as pointer,
allocatable, other. {Matches the order of the descriptions in the
following paragraph, and puts "other" last.}

-----------

27) Bill: (26-jan-2012 email)

8.3.4 Macros, in Table 8.1, change the Code for CFI_attribute_pointer
from "pointer" to "data pointer".  In the following paragraph, in the
description of CFI_attribute_pointer, change "an object" to "a data
object".

-----------

28) Bill/John: (8-jan-2012 email, 26-jan-2012 email)

 8.3.4 Macros, in the para following Table 8.1, replace the last two
 sentences

 "CFI_attribute_assumed specifies ... CFI_attribute_unknown_size
 specifies an object that is, or is argument associated with, an
 assumed-size dummy argument."

with

 "CFI_attribute_other specifies an assumed-shape array, a
  nonallocatable nonpointer scalar, an assumed-size array, or an array
  that is argument associated with an assumed-size array."

{Part of edits to remove CFI_attribute_unknown_size}

------------

29) Bill: (12-123r2, replaces the edit above)

8.3.4 Macros, in the paragraph following Table 8.1:

In the second sentence change

"CFI_attribute_other specifies an assumed-shape array, a
nonallocatable nonpointer scalar, an assumed-size array, or an array
that is argument associated with an assumed-size array."

 to

"CFI_attribute_other specifies a nonallocatable nonpointer object that
is scalar or is an assumed-shape, explicit-shape, or assumed-size
array."

{If the C descriptor corresponds to a Fortran interface dummy that is
assumed-shape and the corresponding actual argument is explicit-shape,
the C descriptor actually describes the actual argument. Should make
the wording here and in subclause 8.2 similar.}

------------

30) Robert: (Ballot comment 3 of 3 from N1895)

8.3.4 Macros

I agree with Van that a macro for an attribute code for scalars should
be included in Table 8.1.  If no such macro is provided, then the TS
should state how scalars are to be handled.  Bill said that a scalar
should be given the attribute code CFI_attribute_unknown_size.  The
only way I see to derive that information from the existing text is by
elimination.

{The new collection of attribute codes allow description of a scalar
that is allocatable (CFI_attribute_allocatable), a pointer
(CFI_attribute_pointer), or neither allocatable nor pointer
(CFI_attribute_other). No additional edit for this comment.}

------------

31) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 6 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.4p6: It's not obvious what attribute code an
assumed-length character scalar.  CFI_attribute_assumed is probably the
correct one, but (if so) the description ought to say so.

{CFI_attribute_assumed was replaced by CFI_attribute_other which can
be used to describe a scalar. With this change, any of allocatable,
pointer, or other attributes can describe a scalar. No additional edit
for this comment.}

----------

32) Bill/Van (18-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.1 General (at the beginning of the function descriptions): Add a
new paragraph after para1

"In function arguments representing subscripts, bounds, extents, or
strides, the ordering of the elements is the same as the ordering of
the elements of the dim member of a C descriptor."  {Subsumes several
comments on the ordering of elements.}

-------------

33) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 8 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.2p2, description of "subscripts": Is the order of subscripts the
Fortran order or the C order?
{Incorporated into the edit for 8.3.5.1.}

----------

34) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 7 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.2p3:  The symbol $r$ appears without explanation.  After "array"
insert "of rank $r$".

-----------

35) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 9 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.2p5: The example would be more informative if the subscripts
were different.  Inquiring minds might realize that Fortran and C
subscripts have opposite ordering, and wonder which order they ought
to appear in the subscripts array. {Changed element (10,10) ->
(5,10). Also changed subscripts[0] value to 4.}

-----------

36) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 10 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.3p1: The style for descriptions in 1539-1 is telegraphic, and in
active rather than passive voice.  Replace "Allocates" with "Allocate".

-------------

37) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 11 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.3p2, descriptions of "lower_bounds" and "upper_bounds": Is the
order of elements in the arrays the order of C array bounds or Fortran
array bounds?
{Incorporated into the edit for 8.3.5.1.}

------------

38) Bill: (6-jan-2012 email) and John: (10-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.3 CFI_allocate:

para following "elem_len" description: Replace "CFI_allocate allocates
memory" with "Successful execution of CFI_allocate allocates memory".
Before the last sentence of the paragraph, insert a new sentence "The
supplied lower and upper bounds override any current dimension
information in the C descriptor.". At the end of the paragraph add "If
the type specified in the C descriptor is a character type, the
supplied element length overrides the current element-length
information in the descriptor." {Last sentence was moved and reworded
from the original comment.}

para before "Result Value": Delete the first sentence "On successful
execution...".

-------------

39) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 12 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.3p4: Is dv->elem_len updated if no error is detected?

Need to add a sentence saying that the member is updated in the case
of a character type, and not updated otherwise.
{Sentence added as part of the previous edit.}

------------

40) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 13 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.3p7: The example would be more informative if the bounds were
different.  Inquiring minds might realize that Fortran and C bounds
have opposite ordering, and wonder which order they ought to appear in
the lower and upper arrays.  {The upper bounds actually are different:
100 and 1000. However, these might be misread, so changed 1000 to 500
twice.}

------------

41) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 14 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.4p1: The style for descriptions in 1539-1 is telegraphic, and in
active rather than passive voice.  Replace "Deallocates" with
"Deallocate".

-----------

42) Bill: (6-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.4 CFI_deallocate:

para following the "dv" description: Replace the whole paragraph with
"Successful execution of CFI_deallocate deallocates memory for the
object using the same mechanism as the Fortran DEALLOCATE
statement. The base_addr member of the C descriptor becomes a null
pointer."
{This now parallels the wording used in CFI_allocate.}

para before "Result Value": Delete the first sentence "On successful
execution...".

------------

43) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 15 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.5p1: The style for descriptions in 1539-1 is telegraphic, and in
active rather than passive voice.  Replace "Establishes" with
"Establish".

------------

44) Bill: (26-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.5 CFI_establish, description of "attribute" formal parameter,
change "CFI_attribute_assumed, CFI_attribute_allocatable, or
CFI_attribute_pointer" to "the attribute codes in Table 8.1".
{With the revised attribute codes, all are valid here.}

------------

45) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 17 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.5p2, description of "extents": Is the order of extents the
Fortran order or the C order?
{Incorporated into the edit for 8.3.5.1.}

------------

46) John: (26-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.5: In the para following the extents para:  I believe that the
omission of the assumed-size case is deliberate. Let's cement this by
adding "These extents shall all be nonnegative." at the end of the
extents paragraph.

------------

47) Bill: (6-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.5 CFI_establish:

para following the "extents" description: Replace "CFI_establish
establishes a C descriptor for an assumed-shape" with "Successful
execution of CFI_establish updates the object with the address dv to
be an established C descriptor for an assumed-shape".

para before "Result Value": Replace the paragraph with "If an error is
detected, the object with the address dv is not modified."

------------

48) John: (26-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.5: I think a change is needed in the para. following the extents
para. The words "an assumed-shape array, an assumed character length
object" should be "a nonallocatable nonpointer data object of known
shape".

{Ed: Also, before the subsequent text "unallocated allocatable" insert
"an ".}

------------

49) Bill: (26-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.5 CFI_establish:

para following the "extents" description: change
"CFI_attribute_assumed" to "CFI_attribute_other".
{Attribute renamed.}

------------

50) Reinhold: (Ballot comment 6 of 6 from N1895)

8.3.5.5 CFI_establish, para following the argument descriptions:
          italicize "attribute" in "; if the attribute argument ..."
          {Modified to use code font rather than italics to match the
          convention for source text.}


------------

51) Bill: (12-130r2)

In 8.3.5.5 CFI_establish, in the paragraph following the extents
description, in the penultimate sentence change


"... but does not describe a Fortran assumed-shape array".

to

"... but does not describe a data object."

{Objects other that assumed-shape arrays are included in the list of
things not described.}

------------

52) Bill: (26-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.5 CFI_establish:

In Note 8.8 change "CFI_attribute_assumed" to "CFI_attribute_other".
{Attribute renamed.}

-----------

53) John: (29-jan-2102 email)

8.3.5.5 CFI_establish:

In Note 8.8 change "Fortran assumed-shape array" to "nonallocatable
nonpointer data object". {Results other than assumed-shape arrays are
allowed.}

-----------

54) Bill: (26-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.5 CFI_establish:

In the last code statement of Example 2 change "CFI_attribute_assumed"
to "CFI_attribute_other".  {Attribute renamed.}

------------

55) John: (11-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.6 CFI_is_contiguous, replace the body of Note 8.10 with:

"A C descriptor for an array describes a contiguous object if it has
extent -1 in its final dim element or if its attribute member indicates
that the array is allocatable."

{Part of edits to remove CFI_attribute_unknown_size}

------------

56) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 18 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.7p1: The style for descriptions in 1539-1 is telegraphic, and in
active rather than passive voice.  Replace "Updates" with "Update".

------------

57) Bill: (26-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.5 CFI_section:

In the description of the "result" formal parameter, change
"CFI_attribute_assumed" to "CFI_attribute_other".  {Attribute
renamed.}

58) Bill: (27-jan-2012 email)  John: (19-jan-2012 email)
    Van: (12-137r1)

8.3.5.7p2, description of the source member, change "an assumed-shape
array" to "a nonallocatable nonpointer array".

{The C descriptor could be describing an explicit-shape array.}

------------

59) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 19 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.7p2, description of "lower_bounds" and "upper_bounds": Is the
order of elements in the arrays the order of C array bounds or Fortran
array bounds?  What is "the given array?"  Should this be "the array
described by the descriptor dv?"  Is it OK for the number of elements
to be > source->rank?

{Ordering issue incorporated into the edit for 8.3.5.1.}

{The "given array" is the "array described by the C descriptor with
the address source", using the same phrasing as in the description for
the strides formal parameter. Make this change for both lower_bounds
and upper_bounds.}

{Change "shall be source->rank" to "shall be greater than or equal to
source->rank" for both lower_bounds and upper_bounds.}

------------

60) John: (28-jan-2012 email)

8.3.5.7 CFI_section, descriptions of lower and upper bounds:

8.3.5.7, lower_bounds para. Change "element of <source>" to  "element of
the array described by the C descriptor with the address <source>".

8.3.5.7, upper_bounds para. Change "element of <source>" to  "element of
the array".

8.3.5.7, upper_bounds para. After "If it is a null pointer," add "the
C descriptor with the address <source> shall not describe an
assumed-size array and"

{Allow an assumed-size array as the source.}

------------

61) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 20 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.7p2, description of "strides": Is the order of elements in the
array the order of C array bounds or Fortran array bounds?  Is it OK
for the number of elements to be > source->rank?

{Ordering issue incorporated into the edit for 8.3.5.1.}

{Change "shall be source->rank" to "shall be greater than or equal to
source->rank" in the description of extents.}

active rather than passive voice.  Replace "CFI_select part updates"
with "Update".

------------

66) Bill: (26-jan-2012 email)

In the description of the "result" formal parameter, change
"CFI_attribute_assumed" to "CFI_attribute_other".  {Attribute

In 8.7 Interoperability of procedures and procedure interfaces,
paragraph 5, second sentence (top of page 31) change:

"The C descriptor shall describe an object with the same characteristics
 as the effective argument; the type member"

to

"The value of the \cf{attribute} member of the C descriptor shall be
compatible with the characteristics of the dummy argument. The members
of the C descriptor other than \cf{attribute} and \cf{type} shall
describe an object with the same characteristics as the effective
argument. The \cf{type} member"

{In a call from Fortran to C, the attribute member of a C descriptor
pointed to by a formal parameter gets its value from the corresponding
dummy argument in the Fortran interface. This is necessary because of
cases such as an allocatable actual argument corresponding to an
assumed-shape dummy in the interface. The attribute has to be
determined by the assumed-shape dummy and not the allocatable actual.
The other members in the descriptor get their values from the
corresponding effective argument, because the corresponding dummy in
the interface could be assumed type or assumed rank. Whether an object
is allocatable, pointer, or neither is a characteristic, so the
current sentence is misleading.}

2) Comments that did not result in a change:
============================================


103) Van (22-oct-2011 email)

Forward p6 in N1885 says "Attention is drawn to the possibility that
some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights."

Should "may" be "might," or does ISO require this non-ISO-ese sentence?

{No action. This exact wording is required in Annex F of the ISO rules.}

------------

104) Robert: (Ballot comment 1 of 3 from N1895 [remainder])

5.4 ASYNCHRONOUS attribute

My greatest concern is still Clause 5.4.

A small point first.  Clause 5.4.1 states that asynchronous
communication is initiated and completed by procedures written in C.
Clause 5.4.2 states that asynchronous communications occurs through
the action of procedures "defined by means other than Fortran."  Those
statements are not equivalent.  Furthermore, both statements exclude
an important possibility, namely that a Fortran processor might
provide nonstandard intrinsic procedures that perform asynchronous
communications.

The statement in paragraph one of Clause 5.4.2 that whether a
procedure is an asynchronous communication initiation or completion
procedure is "processor dependent" might be misleading.  Malcolm
asserted that a procedure either is or is not an asynchronous
communication procedure is determined by the procedure.  Until I saw
Malcolm's e-mail, I thought the draft TS meant that the processor
would recognize a set of routines as asynchronous communication
procedures.  Malcolm's interpretation makes more sense, but the
current text seems ambiguous.  I would like the "processor dependent"
statement to be replaced by language that says that an asynchronous
communication procedure is one that initiates and/or completes
asynchronous communication.

My last concern is that the text in the draft TS does not address the
impact of Clause 5.4 on processors.  Bill said that the Fortran 2008
standard does not address the impact of asynchronous I/O on
processors.  I concede that the normative text of the standard does
not (and I consider that a defect), but Clause C.6.6 does describe the
intended effect.  If the normative text of the TS does not address the
intended impact of asynchronous communications procedures, a note
similar to C.6.6 should be provided for asynchronous communications
procedures.

I would like definitions of asynchronous initiation procedures and
asynchronous completion procedures to be added to Clause 3 "Terms and
definitions."

------------

105) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 2 of 26 from N1895)

5.4.2p1: It seems to be OK for a processor to decide that
  pure real function xyz ( x )
    integer, intent(in) :: x
    xyz = x + 1.0
  end function xyz
is an asynchronous communication initiation or completion procedure.

{There are no edits proposed.}

------------

106) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 3 of 26 from N1895)

6.3p1: With the <array-spec> being <assumed-rank-spec> there's no place
to write explicit lower bounds.  Therefore, all elements of the LBOUND
result would be 1.  The last sentence ought to be something like "The
value of the lower bound of each dimension of the dummy argument is 1,
and the value of the upper bound of dimension N of the dummy argument is
equal to the result of applying the SIZE intrinsic inquiry function to
the actual argument with DIM=N specified."

{I'm concerned about putting the fact that the default return value
for LBOUND() is 1 here in addition to in the description of LBOUND().
If the definition of LBOUND does not say this value is 1, the
definition of LBOUND() should be fixed.  Change not made.}

------------

107) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 4 of 26 from N1895)


6.4.1p1: I don't understand how the expression can work.

{It seems OK to me.  Suppose you have

    real :: a(10,20,*)
    call sub(a)   ! where the interface for sub has the corresponding
dummy DUM as assumed-rank

then RANK(DUM) is 3 and SHAPE(DUM) is [10,20,-1].

The value of SIZE for DIM=3 is specified in 6.4.2 SIZE.  SIZE(DUM,DIM=3)
is -1.  SIZE(DUM) is -200.}

108) John: (Ballot comment 2 of 6 from N1895)

8.2. In line 2, change "assumed character length, assumed rank" to
"assumed size".

Reason: See the list of possible attributes in Table 8.1.

{The text in this sentence was changed differently to conform with the
revised attribute scheme.}

------------

109) Robert: (Ballot comment 2 of 3 from N1895)

8.3.2 CFI_dim_t

I still think the extent field should be an unsigned type, not a
signed type.  I do not think the definition of CFI_index_t is
adequate.  I would be satisfied by a note added to the TS explaining
that range of values of a CFI_index_t might not include all values of
bounds and extents used by a Fortran program.

{Making CFI_index_t unsigned would conflict with the convention of
specifying the extent = -1 for the last dimension of an assumed-size
array.}

------------

110) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 16 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.5 generally: It's not obvious how to establish an assumed-length
character scalar.

{No proposed edits. If the descriptor is for a dummy argument (in
which case the character length is assumed from the actual in the
caller), then the descriptor is already established by the caller.

To establish a descriptor to be use later - for example for the result
argument in a call to CFI_select_part - based on an incoming argument
descriptor named in, then

extent[0] = in->dim[0].extent;
ind = CFI_establish (result, NULL, in->attribute, in->type, 0, in->rank,
extent);

To establish a descriptor for use as an actual argument to another
function, use CFI_establish with the actual value for elem_len and
base_addr if the variable is not an unallocated allocatable.  The
attribute value would depend on whether the object is intended to be
allocatable, pointer, or other (in which case CFI_attribute_other).}

------------

111) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 22 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.5.8p2: It's not obvious how (or even if it's possible) to select a
substring of a character array.

{Suppose you had a descriptor for a Fortran character array with a
declaration of

   character(20) :: string(100)

that was passed into a C function via an interface that specified this
as an assumed-shape array.

The source descriptor in CFI_select_part would look like:

base_addr = addr(string(1)(1:1))
elem_len = 20
version = 1
rank = 1
type = CFI_type_char
attribute = CFI_attribute_other
dim[0].lower_bound = 0
dim[0].extent = 100
dim[0].sm = 20

If you want to create a descriptor for a character section like this:
string(:)(3:15) then the arguments to CFI_select_part would be

  displacement = 2
  elem_len = 13

and the fields in the result descriptor would be the same as the ones in
the source except for:

  base_addr = addr(string(1)(3:3))
  elem_len = 13
}

------------

112) Van: (24-oct-2011 email, Ballot comment 25 of 26 from N1895)

8.3.9p2,p3(1): "BIND" should be "BIND(C)"

{"BIND" is a duplicate of the text in F2008 [433:5] which is being
replaced buy the text in this section. In addition, the name of the
attribute is "BIND", not "BIND(C)".

I believe the intent of the edit is to better "future-proof" the
standard in the event we introduce binding to other languages, such as
BIND(UPC).   In this context, it is clear that the intent is to have
this text to apply only to interoperability with C, and not some other
language.

The current <language-binding-spec> syntax does include the "(C)" part,
although that definition suffers from (in fact, is the source of) the
defect in terms of future expansion.

The edit is being rejected, leaving the text as it is at [433:5].
This avoids the head scratching for "why did this wording change from
the base standard".  The general problem that our current syntax is
deficient for future expansion is a more widespread issue that should
be taken up in the context of the next revision of the base standard.}

-------------

113) John: (Ballot comment 6 of 6 from N1895)

8.3.9, para 5. Change "If a dummy ... actual argument; the" to
"In a reference to the C procedure from Fortran, if a formal parameter
of the prototype is a pointer to CFI_cdesc_t, the corresponding formal
parameter of the reference is interpreted as the address of a C
descriptor with the following properties
   (1) if the dummy argument is allocatable or a pointer, the C
       descriptor shall describe the actual argument;
   (2) otherwise, if the dummy argument is assumed rank, the C
       descriptor shall describe the actual argument as an
       assumed-shape object;
   (3) otherwise, if the actual argument is assumed size, the C
       descriptor shall describe the actual argument;
   (4) otherwise, if the actual argument is a pointer, the C descriptor
       shall describe the target of the actual argument as an
       assumed-shape object;
   (5) otherwise, the C descriptor shall describe the actual argument
        as an assumed-shape object.
In a reference to the Fortran procedure from C, if a formal parameter

   (2) otherwise, the C descriptor shall describe an object with the
       properties declared in the Fortran interface for the dummy
       argument.
The"

Reason: The present wording is insufficiently precise about which
value should be given to the attribute member in the C descriptor.

{With the renaming and simplification of the attributes codes, the
proposed edits are no longer correct. Further, the new scheme is
simple enough that the added description is not needed.}

A.2.6p2 (after the C prototype for MPI_send_f): replace "there is a
           conversion between" by "there exists a conversion facility
           between"

{Change not made. The current text says "...it is assumed that in C
there is a conversion between the C handle...".  The proposed change
is to "...it is assumed that in C there exists a conversion facility
between the C handle...".  This is a technical change. The current
text says that the conversion actually occurs, whereas the replacement
says that there is only an existing facility but it is not necessarily
used.  I believe the intent is that the conversion does actually
occur, and the original text is preferred.}
