X3J3/92-181:   X3J3 Organization and Major Activities

Jerry Wagener

For the past year X3J3 has focused primarily on processing interpretations
and other activities related to Fortran 90 maintenance and defect management.
Because WG5 decided at its 1992 meeting to produce a revision to Fortran 90
in the 1995-96 time frame, with development done by X3J3, significant
attention must now be devoted to revision activities as well as to
maintenance activities. Fortunately the maintenance activities are well in
hand and the volume of maintenance requests appears to be decreasing;
therefore X3J3 can and should begin serious revision activities. This
document describes the X3J3 organization, major activities, and major
products for the next year or so, assuming roughly equal emphasis is given to
maintenance and revision. Adjustments to this plan will be made as needed,
for example if maintenance requirements decrease and additional functional
areas require specialized subgroups.


Major X3J3 Products
-------------------
The major products of X3J3 are documents. In some respects the most important
products are the documents that are continuously used and updated, over a
period of many meetings. These were formerly called X3J3 standing documents
(and given X3J3 RSS numbers), but in 1993 will be numbered in the manner of
all other documents (e.g., X3J3/93-007). For a document that spans years, the
same sequence number will be assigned each year (e.g., X3J3/94-007, X3J3/95-
007, etc.) to facilitate use of these often referenced documents. In the
following descriptions just the Rdouble-ohS numbers will be used (e.g.,
document 007, or just 007). The major X3J3 documents are:
		003 - X3J3 Processes and Procedures
		004 - X3J3 JOD
		005 - X3J3 Resolutions and Responses to WG5 Resolutions
		006 - Fortran 90 Maintenance
		007 - Draft Revision to Fortran 90

Document 003 - X3J3 Processes and Procedures:
This is currently X3J3/S15. It contains procedures X3J3 uses that augment
those described in the X3/SD-2. For example it contains guidelines for hosts
of X3J3 meetings and the detailed procedures that X3J3 uses for processing
Fortran 90 maintenance requests. This document is updated as needed. The
interim editor of 003 is M. Hoffert.

Document 004 - The X3J3 JOD (database of needs and suggested requirements):
This is currently X3J3/S17, the content of which is nominally appendix F of
X3J3/S8.104 (features removed from Fortran 8x). The purpose of this document
is to collect into a single database those items that X3J3 believes represent
the functional needs and suggested requirements for future revisions of the
Fortran standard. This document constitutes X3J3Us input to a similar
database that WG5 maintains at the international level. Document 004 will be
updated after every X3J3 meeting and continuously made available to WG5. The
editor for 004 is the subgroup X3J3/JOD.

Document 005 - X3J3 Resolutions and Responses to WG5 Resolutions:
This is currently X3J3/S14. The WG5 standing document WG5/SD-4 (Strategic
Plan for Fortran Standardization) calls for official communication between
WG5 and the primary development body via R&R (Resolutions and Responses)
documents. Since X3J3 is the primary development body for the next revision
of the international standard, document 005 is intended as the X3J3 part of
this communication. Responses to WG5 resolutions will normally be
incorporated into 005 soon after each WG5 meeting, and resolutions will
normally be placed in 005 at each X3J3 meeting. Thus document 005 will be
updated after every X3J3 meeting and continuously made available to WG5. The
interim editor for 005 is J. Wagener.

Document 006 - Fortran 90 Maintenance (corrections, clarifications, and
interpretations for F90):
This is currently X3J3/S20. It contains the results of all Fortran 90
maintenance activities, including corrections, clarifications, and
interpretations. Items in this document that have been approved by WG5 will
be incorporated into the 1995-96 draft revision, document 007, and will
comprise a major portion of the changes of this revision from Fortran 90.
This document is updated after every X3J3 meeting and made continuously
available to WG5. The editor for 006 is A. Tait.

Document 007 - Draft Revision to Fortran 90 (to be submitted as a CD in 1995):
This document currently exists only as the base document for the 1995-96
draft revision. That base document is, of course, the Fortran 90 standard,
ISO/IEC 1539:1991. The revision will contain the maintenance edits from
document 006, as approved by WG5, and any additional changes approved by X3J3
that are developed from (a) requirements specified by WG5 and (b) editorial
improvements proposed by the X3J3 editorial subgroup. Document 007 will be
first issued following the February 1993 X3J3 meeting, updated at each X3J3
meeting thereafter, and made available continuously to WG5. The editor for
007 is the subgroup X3J3/editorial.


X3J3 Organization
-----------------
X3J3 functions mainly through the use of small subgroups to prepare material
for the full committee. The tentative subgroup structure and initial
memberships, general charter for each subgroup, and products of each subgroup
are as follow. The subgroups are:
		X3J3/F90maint   - defect management, responsible for 006
		X3J3/JOD        - Journal of Development, responsible for 004
		X3J3/parallel   - responsible for all aspects of parallel computing
                                      in Fortran
		X3J3/posix      - responsible for all aspects of POSIX binding to
                                      Fortran
		X3J3/editorial  - editorial subgroup responsible for the draft
                                      revision, 007

the members of this subgroup are organized into small (subsub)groups to

develop its own internal organization, but an initial configuration could be
as follows; the 006-edits group completes informational fields of 006 and
improves the editorial quality of 006; the interp groups develop responses to
specific requests for interpretation and clarification
