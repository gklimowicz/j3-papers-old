Subject: Eliminating SUBTEAM term
Date: 2013 October 14
References: N1983, N1989

Discussion
----------

The term "subteam" introduces potential confusion. Eliminate this in
favor of "team".  A new team will be a subset of an existing team, but
is still a "team" of images.

Edits to N1983:
---------------

Replace all instances of "FORM SUBTEAM" with "FORM TEAM".

Replace all instances of "SUBTEAM_ID" with "TEAM_ID".

Replace all instances of the separate word "subteam" with "team".

Replace all instances of "subteams" with "teams".

Replace all instances of "<subteam_id>" with "<team_id>".

Replace all instances of "<form-subteam-spec>" with
"<form-team-spec>".
