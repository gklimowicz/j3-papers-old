The 24th edition of Ada-Europe's International Conference on Reliable
Software Technologies took place on 11-14 June in Warsaw, Poland, with
considerable success.

The conference, graciously hosted by the Institute of Aviation, had
nearly 100 participants, enjoyed a rich technical and social program,
and saw much active interaction between participants, presenters,
and exhibitors.

For your information, the following material is now available online:
- the "Conference Booklet" in PDF, which contains the abstracts of all
  presentations in the core program (see first section on [1]);
- copies of conference presentations
  (see "Download" links in "Conference Core Schedule" table on [1]);
- copies of DeCPS workshop presentations
  (see "Download links in "Program" table on [2]);
- pictures of the exhibition booths (see final part of [3]).

On this occasion, the Ada-Europe Board announces a slight update of
the name of its conference series:
- the complete name is "25th Ada-Europe International Conference on
   Reliable Software Technologies";
- the short name is "Ada-Europe Conference 2020";
- the acronym is "AEiC 2020".

Hence on social media when referring to the Ada-Europe organization
we'll use #AdaEurope, and when referring to next year's Ada-Europe
Conference we'll use #AEiC2020.
