From:    David Muxworthy/Malcolm Cohen
Subject: UK proposal UK-15 GENERIC stmt as alternative to interface block
Date: 2014 June 24

1. Introduction

Basic functionality: Allow a GENERIC statement as an alternative to an
interface block, with syntax similar to its use within a type
definition.

Rationale: Reduces the number of statements, and thereby long-term cost.

Estimated impact: Minor

Markham M6 conformance: Remove simple deficiency and discrepancy.


2. Specifications and syntax

Allow a GENERIC statement as an alternative to an interface block, with
syntax similar to its use within a type definition.


3. Edits to 14-007r1

[intro] p2, Program units and procedures bullet, append
 "The GENERIC statement can be used to declare generic interfaces.".

[30:14+] 2.1 High level syntax, R207 <declaration-construct>,
         after "<<or>> <format-stmt>"
         insert "<<or>> <generic-stmt>".

[280:22] 12.4.3.2 replace <procedure-name-list> in R1206
         with <specific-procedure-list>

[280:22+] Insert new syntax rule

R1206a <specific-procedure> <<is>> <procedure-name>

[281:8] Change the reference in C1207 to refer to R1206a.

[282:1-] Insert subclause 12.4.3.2a after subclause 12.4.3.2

<<12.4.3.2a GENERIC statement>>

A GENERIC statement specifies a generic identifier for one or more
specific procedures, in the same way as a generic interface block that
does not contain interface bodies.

R1208a <generic-stmt> <<is>> GENERIC [, <access-spec> ] ::
                             <generic-spec> => <specific-procedure-list>

If <access-spec> appears, it specifies the accessibility (5.3.2) of
<generic-spec>.

[284:5] Insert a sentence in 12.4.3.4.1p1 before the final sentence:
"A GENERIC statement specifies a generic interface for each of the
procedures named in its <specific-procedure-list>."

[284:6] Insert a sentence after the first sentence of 12.4.3.4.1p2:  "The
<generic-spec> in a GENERIC statement is a generic identifier for all of
the procedures named in its <specific-procedure-list>."
