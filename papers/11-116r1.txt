1. Introduction

In N1838, 3.3 para 1 makes it clear that an assumed-rank dummy argument
takes its rank from that of the corresponding actual argument, which is
incompatible with sequence association. Unresolved Technical Issue TR8
asks for an edit to the standard that makes this clear.


2. Discussion

This is fundamentally misguided.  The standard says nothing whatsoever
about "assumed-rank" entities, since they don't exist in the standard,
and you can't have an array element of one either.

Edits to the standard need to be separately provided from the normative
descriptive text of the TR, but that is a completely separate issue.

However, review of TR 3.3p1 reveals some problems, in particular, array
bounds are not arrays so saying that the "bounds are arrays" is nonsense.
An edit is provided.

Also, 2.2p3 overly restricts the appearance of assumed-rank objects.
An edit is provided.


3. Edits to N1838

[4:1] After "An assumed-rank variable shall"
      Change "appear only ... associated with"
      to "not appear in a designator or expression except as an
          actual argument corresponding to".
{Otherwise cannot appear in type declaration statement etc.}

[4:3-4] Delete "The ... object.".
{Does not belong here.}

[4:5] Replace entire paragraph with
  "The intrinsic inquiry function RANK can be used to inquire about the
   rank of a data object.  The rank of an assumed-rank object is zero if
   the rank of the corresponding actual argument is zero."

[5:10] 3.3p1,
  After "rank zero"
  Replace the rest of the sentence "and ... zero size"
  With
    "; the shape is a zero-sized array and the LBOUND and UBOUND
     intrinsic functions, with no DIM argument, return zero-sized
     arrays".

[5:21+0] Delete UTI TR8.
