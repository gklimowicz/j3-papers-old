Discussion
----------

In the description of each collective in the TS, all the images of the
current team are mentioned, not the active images. It was not intended
that a collective subroutine be able to execute successfully with a
failed image in the current team. Edits are suggested to remove the
reference to "active images" from three of the collectives (bringing
them into line with the wording for CO_REDUCE and CO_SUM). The TS
incorrectly used the word "active" in the text for 13.6. Edits are
suggested to remove these, too.

We agree with the editor's rewording in 13.7, para. 7.
