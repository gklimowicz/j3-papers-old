Subject: Unresolved issue 250

Unresolved issue 250 states that there needs to be a restriction
on the use of setjmp and longjmp. setjmp and longjmp are
essentially non-local gotos and subvert the ordinary flow
of control. Their use in Fortran can cause many problems.
It is safe to use them in a call-stack that does not contain
any Fortran subprograms.

[270:30+] Insert the following paragraph:

setjmp and longjmp (C standard 7.13) shall not be invoked by
a procedure defined by means of Fortran. If a procedure defined
by means other than Fortran invokes setjmp or longjmp,
then that procedure shall not cause any procedure defined by
means of Fortran to be invoked.
