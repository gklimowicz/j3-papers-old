Subject: Issue 12 : co-bounds definition
Reference: J3/06-007


Discussion of Issue 12 (page 89)

In 06-174r3, what is now paragraph three of 5.3.7.1 was two sentences
in what is now 2.4.6. It should be restored to 2.4.6 so that the
term 'co-bound' is defined early. The values l_i and u_i were needed
to define the values of the co-extents, but this term is not used
any more so its definition can be discarded.

When discussing issue 13 (paper 06-240), we propose two new subclauses
in 5.3.7 for co-arrays.

Edits to J3/06-007

[21:23]. Between the two sentences of the second para. of 2.4.6, add

"The <<co-bounds>> are given in its <allocate-co-array-spec> or
<co-array-spec>. If the co-rank is <r>, the co-array has <r> lower
co-bounds and <r-1> upper co-bounds."

[88:24-26] Delete third paragraph of 5.3.7.1.
