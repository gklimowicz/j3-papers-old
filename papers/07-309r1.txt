NUMBER: F03/0106
TITLE: inquire by unit inconsistencies
KEYWORDS: inquire, unit, not connected
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

There are many things that can be inquired about, such as ACTION
or READ, that are purely file or connection properties.  In
some cases, such as ACTION, the specifier description includes
"If there is no connection [the result is] the value UNDEFINED"
or similar words.  In other cases, such as READ, there seems
to be a tacit assumption that there is a file connected to the
unit.  The descriptions refer to "the file" and don't specify a
result if there is no connection.  In most cases, there is a
phrase like "if the processor is unable to determine if the
file ... [the result is] {UNDEFINED, UNKNOWN, -1, etc.}".

Question 1)  Are the inquire specifiers DIRECT, ENCODING,
FORMATTED, NAMED, NEXTREC, NUMBER, POS, READ, READWRITE,
SEQUENTIAL, SIZE, STREAM, UNFORMATTED, and WRITE allowed
in an INQUIRE by unit when there is no file connected to the
unit?

Question 2)  If so, should the descriptions for the above
specifiers be clarified by adding phrases such as "if there is
no file specified or connected" to the "UNKNOWN" result
descriptions?

ANSWER:

Question 1)  Yes.  In an inquiry by unit, the specifiers have
little meaning when there is no file connected to the unit.
However, the standard should specify the results.

Question 2)  Yes, edits are supplied below.

Note: 9.9.1.15 NAMED= [213:10] needs no edit; the value will be
      false if the unit specified by UNIT= is not connected to
      a file

EDITS:

9.9.1.8 DIRECT= At [212:15], add to the end of the last sentence
 "or if the unit specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.9 ENCODING= At [212:21], after "file" insert "or if the unit
 specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.12 FORMATTED= At [212:36], add to the end of the last sentence
 "or if the unit specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.16 NEXTREC= At [213:16], after "connection" insert "or if the
 unit specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.17 NUMBER= At [213:21+], insert "If the unit specified by
 UNIT= is not connected to a file, the value is the unit specified
 by UNIT=."

9.9.1.21 POS= At [214:20], after "conditions" insert "or if the unit
 specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.23 READ= At [215:2], add to the end of the last sentence
 "or if the unit specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.24 READWRITE= At [215:7], add to the end of the last sentence
 "or if the unit specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.27 SEQUENTIAL= At [215:26], add to the end of the last sentence
 "or if the unit specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.29 SIZE= At [215:34], after "determined" insert "or if the unit
 specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.30 STREAM= At [216:5], add to the end of the last sentence
 "or if the unit specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.31 UNFORMATTED= At [216:10], add to the end of the last sentence
 "or if the unit specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"

9.9.1.32 WRITE= At [216:15], add to the end of the last sentence
 "or if the unit specified by UNIT= is not connected to a file"
