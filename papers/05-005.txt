Notes. 

A. This plan is based on the assumption that we aim for a minor 
revision in 5 years time, much as for Fortran 90/95. Reasons:
  1. Vendors will need time to implement all of Fortran 2003,
  2. Vendors will need time to optimize any of Fortran 2003,
  3. Users will need time to learn much of Fortran 2003,
  4. Users will need time to learn where Fortran 2003 needs improvement,
  5. Authors will need time to prepare textbooks and other media
     supporting Fortran 2003,
  6. Vendors will need time to keep the on-going costs
     of developing Fortran compilers within that which may be recouped
     from the on-going sales of Fortran processors, and
  7. A minor update is indicated by the alternation
     between major and minor updates experienced so far.
