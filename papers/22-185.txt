Subject: C interoperability for new interchange floating-point types
Date: 2022-September-07

1. Introduction
===============

The ISO C23 specification is expected to ratify support for
extended floating point types, specifically, 16-bit and 128-bit
real numbers [1,2].

These types should be added to C-Fortran interoperability features
so that Fortran's REAL16 and REAL128 types (and their complex
counterparts) can be used in a C-interoperable context.

2 . Proposal
============

In 18.2.2 Named constants and derived types in the module, change

"The values of C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE, and C_LONG_DOUBLE shall each ... 
The values of C_FLOAT_COMPLEX, C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, and C_LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX
shall be the same as those of C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE, and C_LONG_DOUBLE,
respectively.

to

"The values of C_FLOAT16, C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE, C_LONG_DOUBLE and C_FLOAT128 
shall each ... The values of C_FLOAT16_COMPLEX, C_FLOAT_COMPLEX, 
C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, C_LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX and C_FLOAT128_COMPLEX shall be
the same as those of C_FLOAT16, C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE, C_LONG_DOUBLE, 
and C_FLOAT128 respectively.

In Table 18.2: Interoperability between Fortran and C types, change

Fortran type | Named constant from the ISO_C_BINDING module .. | C type
...
             | C_FLOAT                   | float
REAL         | C_DOUBLE                  | double

             | C_FLOAT128_COMPLEX        | _Float128 _Complex 
...

3 . Discussion
==============

It is redundant to add _Float32 and _Float64 since the C document
says these have the same representation and alignment as float
and double, respectively.

The omission of a second underscore in the Fortran names is intentional.
The leading underscore in C names exists due to how C reserves names
and is not a descriptive part of the name.
