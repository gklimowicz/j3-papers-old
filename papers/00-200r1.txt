1. Introduction

This paper proposes to add a section on the interoperability of Fortran and C to Annex C. It consists of two examples: one of a Fortran code calling a C routine, and one of a C code calling a Fortran routine. The examples and edits are shown in section 2.

During the writing of the example, it was noted that the current example in note 12.39 is incorrect. An edit to fix this is included in section 2.

2. Edits

[268:29-30] Change these two lines to:

        INTEGER(C_INT), VALUE :: I, J
        REAL(C_FLOAT), VALUE :: R

C.12.1 Examples of Interoperation between Fortran and C Functions

The following examples illustrate the interoperation of Fortran and C functions. Two examples are shown: one of Fortran calling C, and one of C calling Fortran. In each of the examples, we describe the correspondances of:

 - Fortran actual arguments
 - Fortran dummy arguments
 - C formal parameters

These examples are in addition to the code fragment examples, which are listed in notes throughout the standard document.

C.12.1.1 Example of Fortran calling C

C Function Interface:

int C_Library_Function(void* sendbuf, int sendcount, My_Own_Datatype
        sendtype, int *recvcounts)

Fortran Module:

module FTN_C
        USE ISO_C_BINDING
        private
        TYPEALIAS, public ::    MY_OWN_DATATYPE => INTEGER(C_INT)
        interface block
                INTEGER (C_INT) function C_LIBRARY_FUNCTION    &
                (sendbuf, sendcount, sendtype, recvcounts),    &
                BIND(C, NAME='C_Library_Function') 
                        USE ISO_C_BINDING
                        implicit none
                        type (C_PTR), VALUE :: sendbuf
                        INTEGER (C_INT), VALUE :: sendcount
                        type (MY_OWN_DATATYPE), VALUE :: sendtype
                        type (C_PTR), VALUE :: recvcounts
                end function C_LIBRARY_FUNCTION
        end interface block
end module FTN_C

The module FTN_C contains the declaration of the Fortran dummy arguments, which correspond to the C formal parameters. The intrinsic
module ISO_C_BINDING is referenced in the module FTN_C. The NAME
specifier is used in the BIND(C) attribute in order to handle the
case-sensitive name change between Fortran and C from
'C_LIBRARY_FUNCTION' to 'C_Library_Function'. See also note 12.39.

The first C formal parameter is the pointer to void sendbuf, which
corresponds to the Fortran dummy argument sendbuf, which has the type
C_PTR and the VALUE attribute.

The second C formal parameter is the int sendcount, which corresponds
to the Fortran dummy argument sendcount, which has the type
INTEGER(C_INT) and the VALUE attribute.

The third C formal parameter is sendtype, which has the type
My_Own_Datatype defined by C's typedef facility. The TYPEALIAS
statement is specified in Fortran in order to define a
corresponding type alias name. The C formal parameter sendtype
corresponds to the Fortran dummy argument sendtype of type
MY_OWN_DATATYPE.

The fourth C formal parameter is the pointer to int recvcounts, which
corresponds to the Fortran dummy argument recvcounts, which has the
type C_PTR and the VALUE attribute.

Fortran Calling Sequence:

        USE ISO_C_BINDING
        use ftn_c
        ...
        REAL (C_FLOAT), TARGET  :: send(100)
        INTEGER (C_INT)         :: sendcount
        type (MY_OWN_DATATYPE)  :: sendtype
        INTEGER (C_INT), TARGET :: recvcounts(100)
        ...
        call c_library_function(C_LOC(send), sendcount, sendtype, &
        C_LOC(recvcounts))
        ...

The preceding code contains the declaration of the Fortran actual
arguments associated with the above-listed Fortran dummy arguments.

The first Fortran actual argument is the address of the first element
of the array send, which has the type REAL(C_FLOAT) and the TARGET
attribute. This address is returned by the intrinsic function
C_LOC. This actual argument is associated with the Fortran dummy
argument sendbuf, which has the type C_PTR and the VALUE attribute.

The second Fortran actual argument is sendcount of type
INTEGER(C_INT), which is associated with the Fortran dummy argument
sendcount, which has the type INTEGER(C_INT) and the VALUE attribute.

The third Fortran actual argument is sendtype of type
MY_OWN_DATATYPE, which is associated with the Fortran dummy argument
sendtype, which has the type MY_OWN_DATATYPE and the VALUE attribute.

The fourth Fortran actual argument is the address of the first element
of the array recvcounts, with has the type REAL(C_FLOAT) and the
TARGET attribute. This address is returned by the intrinsic function
C_LOC. This actual argument is associated with the Fortran dummy
argument recvcounts, which has the type C_PTR and the VALUE
attribute.

C.12.1.2 Example of C calling Fortran

Fortran Code:

        subroutine simulation(alpha, beta, gamma, delta), BIND(C)
                        USE ISO_C_BINDING
                        implicit none
                        INTEGER (C_LONG), VALUE                 :: alpha
                        REAL (C_DOUBLE), INTENT(INOUT)          :: beta
                        INTEGER (C_LONG), INTENT(OUT)           :: gamma
                        REAL (C_DOUBLE),dimension(*),INTENT(IN) :: delta
                        ...
                        ...
        end subroutine simulation

C Function Interface:

void *simulation(long alpha, double *beta, long *gamma, double delta[])

C Calling Sequence:

simulation(alpha, &beta, &gamma, delta);

The above-listed Fortran code specifies a subroutine with the name
simulation. This subroutine corresponds to the C function with the
name simulation, which returns a pointer to void.

The Fortran subroutine references the intrinsic module
ISO_C_BINDING.

The first Fortran dummy argument of the subroutine is alpha, which has
the type INTEGER(C_LONG) and the attributes VALUE and INTENT(IN). Note
that the VALUE attribute implies the INTENT(IN) attribute. This dummy
argument corresponds to the C formal parameter alpha, which is a
long. The actual C parameter is also a long.

The second Fortran dummy argument of the subroutine is beta, which has
the type REAL(C_DOUBLE) and the INTENT(INOUT) attribute. This dummy
argument corresponds to the C formal parameter beta, which is a
pointer to double. An address is passed as actual parameter in the
C calling sequence.

The third Fortran dummy argument of the subroutine is gamma, which has
the type INTEGER(C_LONG) and the INTENT(OUT) attribute. This dummy
argument corresponds to the C formal parameter gamma, which is a
pointer to long.  An address is passed as actual parameter in the
C calling sequence.

The fourth Fortran dummy parameter is the assumed-size array delta,
which has the type REAL (C_DOUBLE) and the attribute INTENT(IN). This
dummy argument corresponds to the C formal parameter delta, which is a
double array. The actual C parameter is also a double array."
