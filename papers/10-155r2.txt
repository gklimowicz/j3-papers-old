NUMBER: F03/0008
TITLE: IEEE exceptions for intrinsic functions
KEYWORDS: IEEE_INVALID, SRQT
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTIONS:

Section 13.7.1, page 325, lines 10-12 states

    If an infinite result is returned, the flag IEEE_OVERFLOW
    or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO shall signal; if a NaN result is
    returned, the flag IEEE_INVALID shall signal.

Question (1):
The Fortran 2008 standard does not require a standard-conforming
processor to support IEEE_INVALID [14.3p8, 404:15].  If a
processor does not support IEEE_INVALID, is it required to signal
IEEE_INVALID when a NaN result is returned?

Question (2):
IEC 60559 requires the result of SQRT(+inf) to be +inf without
overflow being signaled.  IEC 60559 requires SQRT(qNaN), where qNaN
is a quiet NaN, not to signal an invalid operand exception.  Does
Fortran 2008 require SQRT(QNaN) to signal IEEE_INVALID?

ANSWERS:

Question (1): No.  If the processor does not support IEEE_INVALID,
it cannot signal IEEE_INVALID.

Question (2): No.  The standard does not specify the behavior of
SQRT on qNaN.
