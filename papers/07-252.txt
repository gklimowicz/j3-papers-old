Discussion

An edit is supplied to correct a bullet point in 2.4.5. The new text
is based on that in 9.11.

Note: This edit is not needed if the whole list is deleted in response
to UTI 118.

Edits to 07-007r2:

[28:24-26] In 2.4.5 Execution sequence, para. 6, replace the third
bullet point by these three bullet points

 "o an error condition occurs during the execution of an
    input/output statement that contains neither an ERR= nor an
    IOSTAT= specifier,
  o an end-of-file condition occurs during the execution of an
    input/output statement that contains neither an END= nor an
    IOSTAT= specifier,
  o an end-of-record condition occurs during the execution of an
    input/output statement that contains neither an EOR= nor an
    IOSTAT= specifier,"
