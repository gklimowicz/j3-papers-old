Revised Suggested edits (cf 06-114)

[294:27]    After "ATAN(X)" add "or ATAN(Y,X)"

[298:16+15] After "ATAN" in the first column in the table in 13.6,
            insert "(X)".

[305:28]    After "ATAN(X)" add " or ATAN(Y,X)"

[305:31-34] Change to read:

Arguments.
Y            shall be of type real.
X            If Y is present, X shall be of type real with the same kind
             type parameter as Y.  If Y has the value zero, X shall not
             have the value zero.
             If Y is absent, X shall be of type real or complex.

Result characteristics.  Same as X.

Result value.  If Y is present, the result is the same as the result of
               ATAN2(Y,X).
               If Y is absent and X is real, the result is real, is expressed
               in radians, and has a value equal to a processor-dependent
               approximation to arctan(X) that lies in the range
                 $-\frac\pi2 \leq$ ATAN(X) $\leq \frac\pi2$.
               If Y is absent and X is complex, the result is complex. The
               real part is expressed in radians and lies in
               the range
                 $-\frac\pi2 \leq$ REAL(ATAN(X)) $\leq \frac\pi2$.

Note 1 to editor:  please add a note on page xiii:
  xx) The ATAN intrinsic is extended so that ATAN (Y, X) is ATAN2 (y,X).

Note 2 to editor: these edits assume that paper 05-204r2 has passed.
     If 05-204r2 is withdrawn, the text in "Arguments."

       X     If Y is present, X shall be of type real with the same kind
             type parameter as Y.  If Y has the value zero, X shall not
             have the value zero.
             If Y is absent, X shall be of type real or complex.

     becomes

       X     shall be of type real.  If Y is present, X shall have the
             same kind type parameter as Y.  If Y has the value zero, X
             shall not have the value zero.

     and the text in "Result value."

               If Y is absent and X is real, the result is real, is expressed
               in radians, and has a value equal to a processor-dependent
               approximation to arctan(X) that lies in the range
                 $-\frac\pi2 \leq$ ATAN(X) $\leq \frac\pi2$.
               If Y is absent and X is complex, the result is complex. The
               real part is expressed in radians and lies in
               the range
                 $-\frac\pi2 \leq$ REAL(ATAN(X)) $\leq \frac\pi2$.

     becomes

               If Y is absent, the result is real, is expressed
               in radians, and has a value equal to a processor-dependent
               approximation to arctan(X) that lies in the range
                 $-\frac\pi2 \leq$ ATAN(X) $\leq \frac\pi2$.

Note to text users:  "$-\frac\pi2 \leq$ ATAN(X) $\leq \frac\pi2$" is
                     fancy way of saying "-pi/2 <= ATAN(X) <= pi/2".
