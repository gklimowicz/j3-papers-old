Subject: Deleting statement functions
Date 2005 July 26

At Delft, it was decided to delete the obsolescent feature
statement functions.  This paper attempts to provide edits to do so.

Edits consist of deleting all references to statement functions
in page order throughout 007.  A paragraph is moved within the appendix.
Edits are also provided to add a new paragraph to Section 1
describing the deleted feature.

Thanks to Van and Dick for useful comments,
which are incorporated herein.

Edits:

[iv] delete "12.5.4 Statement functions" and page number
[viii] delete "B.2.3 Statement functions" and page number
[3:9+] Add a new subsection before the current 1.6.1:
"1.6.1 Fortran 2003 compatibility

Except as identified in this section, this standard is
an upward compatible extension to the preceding Fortran
International Standard, ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004
(Fortran 2003). Any standard-conforming Fortran 2003 program remains
standard-conforming under this standard. The following Fortran 2003
features may have different interpretations in this standard:

(1) Earlier Fortran standards had the concept of statement functions.
These had peculiar scoping rules and did not conform to programmer's
expectations in other ways.  Since Fortran 90, they have been
superseded by contained functions.  Statement functions
have been deleted in this standard."
