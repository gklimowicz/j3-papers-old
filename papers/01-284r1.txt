Page 13, 2.2.3.4, third line.  Change "or that" to "or to specify that"

Page 31, next to last line.  Bad line break.

Page 45, note 4.26.  Put blanks around the = after Organizer

Page 46, note 4.31.  C.1.4 also initializes value to 0.  We should do
that here to avoid confusion.

Page 56, lines 12 and 14. paragraph after note 4.58.  Replace NULL() with NULL in both places.  In general, the references to function names don't include the "()".  Because NULL() is so frequently used, we probably need a good GREP here to check for other uses of NULL() when we mean NULL.

Page 84, C575.  There appears to be no space after the (R553)

Page 107, section 7, first line.  Delete the "the" before "assignment"

Page 113, 7.1.4.2, last 2 lines and several places on top of next page.  The "op" looks bold italic in the PDF version.  Is this real or an artifact of Frame/PDF?  If real, they should be italic, not bold.

Page 113, 7.1.4.1, fifth line.  Remove parens around 4.5.8 ala next
line.
