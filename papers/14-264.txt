The restriction in F2008 13.5 at 329:1-3 reads

"The effects of calling COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE,
GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, and GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE on any
image other than image 1 are processor dependent."

With the introduction of teams, the ambiguity would apply to images
other than image 1 of the initial team, leaving some teams with no
access at all. Lifting the restriction where possible would be
helpful.  In particular, the COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, GET_COMMAND, and
GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT intrinsic subroutines return a relatively small
amount of read-only data that is the same for all images.  There is no
technical reason these subroutine cannot funtion normally on all
images.  In the worst implementaion, image 1 could stash the
information in a known location on image 1 that other images could
reference.


Edits to 14-007r2:

[329:1-2] Delete "COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT,", "GET_COMMAND,", and
"GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT,".
