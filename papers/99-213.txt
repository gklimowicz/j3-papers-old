NUMBER: 000067
TITLE:  writing zeros
KEYWORDS:  list-directed output, namelist output
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS:  J3 consideration in progress

The standard currently requires a real zero to be
written in exponential form when using list-directed
or namelist output. 

QUESTION: Is this requirement intentional or an oversight?

ANSWER:
The requirement is an oversight.

DISCUSSION:
The G edit descriptor was changed in Fortran 90 to
format a real zero as if an F edit descriptor were
provided in most cases.  The same change was not
made for list-directed or namelist output, but should
have been made.

EDITS:

    For Fortran 95:
    In section 10.8.2 (List-directed output), fifth paragraph, [177:41],
    change "If the magnitude x is within this range" to
    "If the magnitude x is within this range or is zero" 

    and in section 10.9.2.1 (Namelist output editing), third paragraph,
    [182:33], change "If the magnitude x is within this range" to
    "If the magnitude x is within this range or is zero" 


    For 99-007r2:
    In section 10.9.2 (List-directed output), fifth paragraph, [246:10],
    change "If the magnitude x is within this range" to
    "If the magnitude x is within this range or is zero" 

    and in section 10.10.2.1 (Namelist output editing), third paragraph,
    [251:4], change "If the magnitude x is within this range" to
    "If the magnitude x is within this range or is zero"
