Subject: THIS_IMAGE simplification
From: Bill Long
Date: 2009 November 08

Discussion:

The THIS_IMAGE intrinsic function referenced with a coarray argument,
but no DIM argument, returns an array with cosubscript values. A
common case is a coarray of rank one, in which case it would be
simpler for users if the result value was an integer scalar rather
than an array of size 1.

Edits for 09-007r3:

[394:6] In 13.7.165 "THIS_IMAGE()...", paragraph 4, 'Result
Characteristics', replace

"or DIM is present"

with

", DIM is present, or COARRAY appears and has corank one".

[394:10-12] In paragraph 5 'Result Value' of the same subclause,
before the current Case(ii) insert:

 "<Case (ii):> The result of THIS_IMAGE(COARRAY) for COARRAY of corank
 one is the cosubscript value for COARRAY that would specify the
 invoking image."

In the current Case(ii) after "(COARRAY)" add " for COARRAY of corank
greater than one".

Renumber the existing Case(ii) and Case(iii) to be Case(iii) and
Case(iv) respectively.
