Edits for 09-007r3

[298:8] Append new sentences to the end of 12.5.2.9p2
  "If both the actual argument and dummy argument are known to be
   functions, they shall have the same type and type parameters.
   If only the dummy argument is known to be a function, the function
   that would be invoked by a reference to the dummy argument shall
   have the same type and type parameters, \obs{except that an
   external function with assumed character length may be associated
   with a dummy argument with explicit character length}".
{The second sentence is there to catch an argument association chain,
 and this case needs to allow the obsolescent assumed-length character
 function.  In the case in the first sentence, the actual argument
 already is prevented from having assumed length by our other rules.}
