Subject: Comments on the Introduction
Date: 2016 October 12

1. Edits accepted (with modification)

[intro,p2,Data declaration]
  Append the sentence from "Data usage and computation":
    "The EQUIVALENCE and COMMON statements and the block data program unit
     have been redundant since Fortran 90 and are now specified to be
     obsolescent."
{Fits better here.}

[intro,p2,Data usage and computation]
  Delete (moved) sentence "The EQUIVALENCE... obsolescent.".
  Move (delete) sentences
    "Labeled DO... obsolescent.  The arithmetic... deleted."
  and
    "The nonblock... deleted."
  and
    "The locality... specified.  The SELECT... array."
  into "Execution control" as described below.
{Fits better there.}

[intro,p2,Data usage and computation]
  Append statement from IEEE update bullet, modified:
    "The <, <=, >, and >= operations on IEEE numbers provide the
     compareSignaling{relation} operations; the == and /= operations on
     IEEE numbers provide the compareQuiet{relation} operations."
{Fits better here.  Modified for anticipated correction to comparisons.}

[intro,p2,Execution control]
  Insert at the beginning the sentences from "Data usage and computation":
    "Labeled DO loops have been redundant since Fortran 90 and are now
     specified to be obsolescent. The arithmetic IF statement has been
     deleted."
   then insert immediately following the next sentence therefrom
    "The nonblock DO construct has been deleted."
   then the final sentence group
    "The locality of a variable used in a DO CONCURRENT construct can be
     explicitly specified. The SELECT RANK construct provides structured
     access to the elements of an assumed-rank array."
{Fits better here.}

[intro,p2,Program units and procedures]
  Move "The ERROR STOP statement can appear in a pure subprogram."
  to be the penultimate sentence.
{Pure subprogram items are better together.}

[intro,p2,Changes to the intrinsic modules IEEE_ARITHMETIC...]
  Delete (moved) sentence "The standard... relations.".
{Fits better elsewhere.}

2. Edits rejected

Under "Data usage and computation" replace the first sentence with "The
declared type of the value specified for a polymorphic allocatable
component in a structure constructor is allowed to be type compatible
with the declared type of the component" and perhaps append "rather than
being required to have the same declared type as the component."

REJECTED: Too verbose.  This is the Introduction, not John Reid's
          comprehensive description of what the new features are.
          The existing sentence is adequate to signal this new feature.

Move the item "Input/Output" to be after the item "Execution control" to
put it in the same order as the relevant clauses.

REJECTED: This is the same order we used for Fortran 2008.

Move the item "Intrinsic procedures and modules" to be after the item
"Program units and procedures" to put it in the same order as the
relevant clauses.

REJECTED: Ditto.

Under "Program units and procedures" move the final sentence before the
penultimate sentence, to bring material about the VALUE attribute
together.

REJECTED: This does not seem to be a significant connection.

Move the item "Features previously described by ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012"
to be after the item "Changes to the intrinsic modules IEEE_ARITHMETIC,
IEEE_EXCEPTIONS, and IEEE_FEATURES for conformance with ISO/IEC/IEEE
60559:2011" to put it in the same order as the
relevant clauses.

REJECTED: Features previously described by TS 29113 are scattered across
          a number of subclauses, not limited to the interop clause.
