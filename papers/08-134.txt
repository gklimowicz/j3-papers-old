Subject: co-indexed object does not apply to procedure components

Discussion:

[472:7] says "FPTR shall be a procedure pointer,
and shall not be a co-indexed object"

This is clearly wrong since procedures cannot be co-indexed objects.

Edits.

[472:7] Change the first setence of the description of the FPTR
argument
to C_F_PROCPOINTER to:
"shall be a procedure pointer,
and shall not be a component of a co-indexed object"
