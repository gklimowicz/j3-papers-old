Subject: Variable definition context

1. Introduction
===============

According to 16.6.7p1(13),  A <variable> appears in a variable
definition context if it is the <selector> in a SELECT TYPE or ASSOCIATE
construct and the associate name of that construct appears in a variable
definition context.

This ought to include that a subobject of the associate name appears in
a variable definition context.

Since we're not doing another corrigendum for Fortran 2008, there's no
point in processing this as an interpretation.

2. Edits to 14-007
==================

[somewhere in a subclause of 1.6 dealing with Fortran 2008 compatibility]

  "o The appearance of a subobject of an associate name in a variable
     definition context within a SELECT TYPE or ASSOCIATE construct now
     results in the selector being considered to have appeared in a
     variable definition context."

[464:14 16.6.7p1(13)] Insert ", or a subobject thereof," after "that
construct".
