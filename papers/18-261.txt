Subject: WG9 (Ada) liaison report
Date: 2018-October-10

WG9 (Ada) will meet during the week of 22 October 2018.  The detailed
agenda is the PDF with the same number as this paper.

WG9 is responsible for seven documents:

ISO/IEC 8652:2012 -- Ada language standard

ISO/IEC 8652:2012/COR.1:2016 -- Ada 2012 Corrigendum 1 (2015)

ISO/IEC 15291:1999 -- Ada Semantic Interface Specification

  This is a specification for compiler output of syntax and semantic
  information, and a collection of software tools to use it.  It has
  not been updated since 1999.  Most people use the "libadalang" tools at

    https://github.com/AdaCore/libadalang

  because they are so much easier to use.  Both are useful for static
  analysis of packages and programs.

ISO/IEC TR 24718 -- Guide for the use of the Ada Ravenscar Profile in
                    high integrity systems

  I have this as a YCS-2017-348, a technical report from University of
  York, not as an ISO document.

ISO/IEC TR 15942:2000 -- Guide for the use of the Ada programming
                         language in high integrity systems

ISO/IEC 18009:1999 -- Conformity assessment of a language processor

  This is a test suite to verify conformance of a processor to the
  standard.  It is available from

    http://www.ada-auth.org/acats.html

  The standard has not been updated, but the test suite has been.
  AdaCore runs this test suite every night as part of regression testing.

ISO/IEC TR 24772-2 -- Guidance to avoiding vulnerabilities in programming
                      languages -- Part 2: Ada

I have not downloaded the test suite.  I do not have ISO/IEC 18009:1999,
or ISO/IEC TR 24772-2, which is published by WG 23.

I also have the Annotated Reference Manual, the Ada 2012 rationale, and
the rationale for 2012 TC1.
