Subject: F202Y Define a standard Fortran preprocessor
Date: 2023-June-14

Reference: 23-141, 23-154, 23-lwm

To support Fortran program portability, users requested we add a Fortran
preprocessor to the Fortran standard for Fortran 202Y.

The goal would be a preprocessor with syntax similar to that used by the C
preprocessor (ISO/IEC 9899:2018), integrated into 'Part 1' of the standard.

Its behavior should be similar to that found in or used with existing
Fortran processors.

The standard preprocessor should be aware of features unique to Fortran
(e.g., awareness of the unique issues in fixed-form source code).
