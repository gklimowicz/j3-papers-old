Under "Data usage and computation" replace the first sentence with "The
declared type of the value specified for a polymorphic allocatable
component in a structure constructor is allowed to be type compatible
with the declared type of the component" and perhaps append "rather than
being required to have the same declared type as the component."

Under "Data usage and computation" move the sentence about EQUIVALENCE
and COMMON to the list item "Data declaration".

Under "Data usage and computation" move the sentences about constructs
to the list item "Execution control".

Move the item "Input/Output" to be after the item "Execution control" to
put it in the same order as the relevant clauses.

Move the item "Intrinsic procedures and modules" to be after the item
"Program units and procedures" to put it in the same order as the
relevant clauses.

Under "Program units and procedures" move the final sentence before the
penultimate sentence, to bring material about the VALUE attribute
together.

Move the item "Features previously described by ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012"
to be after the item "Changes to the intrinsic modules IEEE_ARITHMETIC,
IEEE_EXCEPTIONS, and IEEE_FEATURES for conformance with ISO/IEC/IEEE
60559:2011" to put it in the same order as the
relevant clauses.
