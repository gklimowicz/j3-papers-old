Subject: Allow current team for TEAM argument and image selector

1. Discussion

This paper is another response to Van's Part1 ballot comments.

The optional TEAM argument for various intrinsic coarray procedures in
the TS excludes setting the value to the current team.  Although
alternative syntax is available for that case (i.e. not using the
optional argument), the exclusion is unnecessary, potentially
confusing to users, and forces burdensome conditional logic in some
cases.  E.g.

type (Team_Type) :: heritage(:)

...

! Check to see if everything is still ok
! Check current team and then work out through ancestors:

! Current team is special syntax - no TEAM argument
if ( size (FAILED_IMAGES() > 0) then
   ! do something about it
   ...
end if

do i = 2, size(heritage)
   if ( size(FAILED_IMAGES(TEAM=heritage(i))) > 0 ) then
      ! do something about it
      ...
   end if
end do


Allowing the TEAM argument to be set to the current team is much
cleaner, and enhances consistency within the standard as a whole.
E.g. we allow INT(i, kind=KIND(i)).

A similar, but stronger case arises with image selectors.  The
exclusion of the current team could greatly complicate application
infrastructure that accepts a TEAM_ID argument and must then provide
duplicate logic for the case that TEAM_ID is the current team.
