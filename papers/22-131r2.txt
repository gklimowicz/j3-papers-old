Subject: Desired meeting format for J3 meeting #227
Date: 2022-March-08

ISO guidance allows WG convenors to call hybrid (virtual + in-person)
meetings at their discretion; purely in-person meetings require ISO
approval at this time. It is possible that future meetings will continue to
be allowed the option of being held virtually, even if hybrid or in-person
meetings are permitted. INCITS generally follows ISO guidance regarding
these matters.

J3 meeting #227 will be held jointly with WG5 meeting #26, which is
expected to have a hybrid format. For J3 meeting #227, J3 should adopt the
same meeting format as WG5 if possible, in order to conduct the joint
meeting as efficiently as possible.

Approval of this paper would demonstrate J3's preference to conduct meeting
#227 using a hybrid format, subject to evolving guidance and requirements
from INCITS.
