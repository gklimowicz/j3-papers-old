DISCUSSION

Unresolved Technical Issue TR1 of N1838 refers to the fact that CLASS(*)
and TYPE(*) entities are both unlimited polymorphic but the conditions
on their use differ. In most cases, the restrictions on assumed-type
variables in paragraph 3 of 2.1 in N1838 ensure that a reference to an
unlimited polymorphic entity has to be a reference to a CLASS(*) entity.
Edits are proposed here for the few cases where this is not so.

EDIT to N1838:

[3:18] In 2.1 Assumed-type objects, para 4, at the end of the sentence,
add

Since a CLASS(*) entity is unlimited polymorphic, too, the following
edits to ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 are needed.

4.3.1.3 CLASS
In paragraph 4, line 3, change 'an unlimited polymorphic' to
'a CLASS(*)'.

12.5.2.5 Allocatable and pointer dummy variables
In paragraph 2, line 2, change 'either both the actual and dummy
arguments shall be unlimited polymorphic, or' to 'either both the actual
and dummy arguments shall be CLASS(*), both the actual and dummy
arguments shall be assumed type, or'.
