Subject: Interp request: function references in DATA statements

NUMBER: F08/????
TITLE: function references as variables in DATA statements
KEYWORDS: function, reference, DATA
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The Fortran 2008 standard extended the syntax of variables to
allow references to functions to be variables (6.2, 117:13,15).
Because of that extension, a function reference may appear as a
/data-stmt-object/ (5.4.7, 104:15).  For example, the program

      PROGRAM DATA
        REAL, TARGET :: X
        DATA PF()/1.0/
      CONTAINS
        FUNCTION PF()
          REAL, POINTER :: PF
          PF => X
        END FUNCTION
      END

satisfies the syntax rules and constraints of Fortran 2008.
Was this intended?

ANSWER:

References to function were not intended to be allowed as
/data-stmt-object/s.  An edit is supplied to correct this
oversight.

EDIT:

[5.4.7, 104:26-27]

Replace
    "In a /variable/ that is a /data-stmt-object/, each
     subscript, section subscript, substring starting point
     and substring ending point shall"
with
    "A /variable/ that is a /data-stmt-object/ shall be a
     /designator/, not an /expr./  Each subscript, section
     subscript, substring starting point, and substring
     ending point in the /variable/ shall"
