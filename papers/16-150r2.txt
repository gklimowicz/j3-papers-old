Reference: 16-007

Following the discussion Tuesday morning, subgroup decided
to take one issue from 16-150 and give it further action.

[210:9-10] 9.5.1p3 says that an external unit identified
by the same integer value is the same unit throughout the program.

Surely, the intention is per image, not per program.

Edit to 16-007

[210:9] at the beginning of the sentence, change "The"
to "On each image, the"

[210:10] delete "of the program"

so the new sentence reads:

"On each image, the external unit identified by a particular value
of a <<scalar-int-expr>> is the same external unit in all
program units."

{state correct scope of external unit values}
