This paper attempts to provide edits to implement
the detailed specification
of the enhanced stop item, viz

Detailed Specification: (Task J3-001)

(1) The stop code shall be allowed to be a scalar initialization
    expression of type default integer or default character.
(2) Recommend that the stop code be displayed on ERROR_UNIT.
(3) Recommend that if the stop code is of integer type,
    it should be used as the process exit status (if the processor
    even has such a concept).
(4) Note that the processor might use only a portion of such
    a stop code for the exit status.
(5) That default integer be required to support all the integer stop
    codes allowed by previous standards, i.e. up to 99999.

Syntax:

STOP [<stop-code>]

where <stop-code> may be either 
a scalar default integer initialization expression or
a scalar default character initialization expression.

Edits to 04-007:

In 4.4.1 Integer type, third paragraph, [36:23], Append
  "The decimal exponent range of default integer shall be at least 5."

In 8.4 STOP Statement page 170 of 04-007

[170:22-23]
Change R850 to
"<stop-code> <<is>> <scalar-char-initialization-expr>
             <<or>> <scalar-int-initialization-expr>

C8?? (R850) The <scalar-char-initialization-expr> shall be of default kind.
C8?? (R850) The <scalar-int-initialization-expr> shall be of default kind."

[170:24] delete C834

[170:26-27]
In the following paragraph, delete the second sentence
"Leading zero digits in the stop code are not significant."

[170:29+]
Add a paragraph:

        "It is recommended that the
         <stop-code> is made available by formatted output
         to the processor-dependent external unit
         identified by the named constant ERROR_UNIT
         of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module (Section 9.4)."

Add a Note following the paragraph:
        "Note 8.21+ If the <stop-code> is an integer,
         it is recommended that the value also be used
         as the process exit status,
         if the operating system supports that concept.
         If the integer <stop-code> is used as the process
         exit status, the operating system might be able
         to interpret only values within a limited range,
         or only a limited portion of the integer value
         (for example, only the least-significant 8 bits)."
