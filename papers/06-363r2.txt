Subject: Issue 83 : ENTRY restrictions
Reference: J3/06-007r1


Discussion of issue 83 (page 332)

In addition to the exceptions noted in [331:38-40] there are other
ways in which a name that appears as a dummy argument in an ENTRY
statement might be used before the ENTRY statement.  In particular,
statement and construct entities have a scope restricted to the
statement or construct and would not interfere with a use of the same
name as a dummy argument in an ENTRY statement. The edits below intend
to fix this defect.

Edits to J3/06-007r1

[331:40] Append to the end of the sentence ", except where it appears
as the name of a statement or construct entity (16.4 Statement and
construct entities), a keyword in a constructor (4.5.10 Construction
of derived-type values), or a keyword in a procedure reference (12.5.1
Procedure reference/Syntax)."
