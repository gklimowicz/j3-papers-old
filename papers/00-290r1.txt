    Unresolved issue 122:
        Delete unresolved issue 122 [193:1-26]
    
        [192:31-34], Change "The values returned ... returns." to
        "If one of these arguments has the value true when the user-defined
         derived type input/output procedure returns, the corresponding
         condition is triggered by the processor in the parent data transfer
         statement.  No more than one of these arguments shall have a true
         value when the user-defined derived type input/output procedure
         returns."
    
        [192:35], change "<err>" to
        "<err>, <eof>, or <eor>"
    
        Replace [192:38-40] with:
        "If the <err>, <eof>, or <eor> argument of a user-defined derived
         type input/output procedure has the value true when that procedure
         returns, and the processor therefore terminates execution of the
         program as described in section 9.5.3, the processor shall make the
         value of the <iomsg> argument available in a processor-dependent
         manner."
