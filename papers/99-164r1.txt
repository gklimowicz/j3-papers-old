Date:    3rd June 1999
To:      J3
From:    Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Unresolved issue 44


1. Introduction

Issue 44 says "Are there any requirements relating to accessibility changes
when overriding a binding?".  The answer is yes, once a binding is PUBLIC it
cannot be taken away (viz made PRIVATE); however a PRIVATE binding can be
made
PUBLIC in an extension.

I have put this into the subsection on tbp-overriding (4.5.3.2) as I thought
it fitted better there than in 4.5.1.6 - perhaps the editor will tell me if
it ought to be in 4.5.1.6.

2. Edits

{Delete the J3 note}
[52:29-31] Delete.

{Require PUBLIC tbps to stay PUBLIC}.
[57:11+] Add new item to list
"(6) If the inherited binding is PUBLIC then the overriding binding shall
not
     be PRIVATE."
{Editorial: This list has items separated by periods - should these not be
semicolons?}
