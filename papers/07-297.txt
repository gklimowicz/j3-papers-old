NUMBER:   F03/
TITLE:    Evaluation of bound-expr in data pointer assignment
KEYWORDS: pointer, pointer assignment, bounds, expression
DEFECT TYPE: Error
STATUS:   Erratum

DISCUSSION

Currently there are no rules in 7.4.2.1 to prohibit changing of a
pointer's association status during evaluation of bound expressions
in a data pointer assignment (pointer with either bounds-spec or
bounds-remapping specified).  This may lead to ambiguous code with
regard to the evaluation orders between the bound expression and
the data pointer assignment itself.  Consider the following code,


    integer,  target  :: tar2(100, 100)
    integer,  target  :: tar1(100)
    integer,  pointer :: ptr(:,:)

    ptr(-2:, f1(ptr, tar1, 1, 1):) => tar2

    print*, lbound(ptr)
    print*, ubound(ptr)
    print*, size(ptr)

    contains

    function f1(ptr, arr, i, j)
        integer  :: i, j, f1
        integer, pointer :: ptr(:, :)
        integer, target  :: arr(:)

        ptr (i:j, i:j) => arr
        f1 = -1
    end function

    end


In 7.4.1.3 for interpretation of intrinsic assignments, there are rules
explicitly requesting evaluation of all expressions in variable occurred
before the variable is defined [139:14-19].  It appears that data point
assignment should also follow similar rules.

Note the similar problem also exists for evaluating the <data-target> if
it references a function that returns a data pointer.


QUESTION:

    (a) Is this program intended to be standard conforming?

    (b) If it is standard conforming, then what would it print?


ANSWER:

    (a) Yes, this program is standard conforming.

    (b) The function f1 is evaluated before the data pointer assignment
        occurs. The execution of the program should print the following

 -2 -1
 97 98
 10000

        Edits are provided to clarify this.

EDITS:

    [144:8+] The execution of the data pointer assignment shall have the
    same effect as if the evaluation of <data-target> and the evaluation
    of all expressions in <bounds-spec> or <bounds-remapping> occurred
    before the <data-pointer-object> becomes associated with the <data-
    target>. None of the evaluations shall either affects or be affected
    by any other evaluation.
