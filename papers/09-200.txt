Discussion:

UTI 163 (page 102) contains five paragraphs describing changes to
"5.3.19 VOLATILE attribute". The text rearrangements and changes
described in paragraphs 1, 4, and 5 look OK.

Para 2: The constraint on pointers, coarrays, and VOLATILE (C719 at
[160:6-7]) is in 7.2.2.2, not 7.2.2.1 as indicated in the current text
at [102:14]. Further, the editor objects to the term "described" for
text that is only a single constraint without added explanation.
Edits are provided to address these issues.

Para 3: The proposed new sentence

   "A pointer without the VOLATILE attribute shall not be associated
    with a coarray with the VOLATILE attribute."

is redundant with the current constraint C719

   "A coarray <data-target> shall have the VOLATILE attribute if and
    only if the <data-target-object> has the VOLATILE attribute."

Both prohibit

     integer,target,volatile :: c(10)[:]
     integer,pointer         :: p(:)

     p => c

There are no other conforming associations between a pointer and a
coarray with the VOLATILE attribute.  For example, in the case of
argument association, a coarray dummy shall be associated with a
coarray actual argument [299:2-3], and a coarray cannot be a pointer
[99:15-16].  A pointer dummy argument corresponding to a coarray (and
hence nonpointer) actual argument is not associated [294:20-21]. It is
not clear that the new sentence adds anything.


------------

Edit to 09-007r1:

[102:14] In the last sentence of para 2 of "5.3.19 VOLATILE attribute"
replace "described in 7.2.2.1" with "constrained by C719."
