Subject:   Constraints/requirements on branch targets

1. Introduction
===============

Interp F08/0119, which passed J3 letter ballot and is the subject of a
WG5 straw vote, proposed consolidating the requirements on branch
targets into two constraints.  The description of the range of a DO
construct (subclause 8.1.6.4 in F08 standard) has been deleted, so the
edit proposed to that subclause is not included here.  The nonblock DO
construct has been deleted, so the constraint proposed concerning a
<do-term-shared-stmt> is not included here.
