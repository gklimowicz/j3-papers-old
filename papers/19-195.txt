From: Dan Nagle
Subject: longer lines missing edit US01
Date: 2019-August-05

Reference: 18-007r1, 19-138r1


Introduction

One longer-line missing edit has been found, it is in Annex A.

Previously, any non-default character in a source line
meant that the maximum line length was processor dependent,
and this is mentioned in Annex A.

The new line length rule removed this distinction.
Therefore, this distinction must also be removed from Annex A.
An edit is supplied to do so.



Edits to 18-007r1

{ in the second bullet list in Annex A, in A.2 }

[518:27-28] { the redundant bullet item }
"the maximum number of characters allowed on a source line
 containing characters not of default kind (6.3.2, 6.3.3);"

[518:27-28] Remove the now-wrong PD
delete the bullet at lines 27-28

{ no longer state the PD of the distinction no longer made }
