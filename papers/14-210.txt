Subject: Requiring Asynchronous Progress
Date: 2014 June 26
References: N2007


WG5 agreed to require some form of asynchronous progress, at least for
atomics and events, with details to be worked out by the J3 coarray
mailing list.  The requirements will be specified when N2007 is
integrated with the main standard.  This paper proposes the changes to
N2007 to make this clear.


Edits to N2007
--------------

[1:5+] 1 Scope, after paragraph 1, add a new paragraph

    "This Technical Specification does not specify formal data
    consistency or progress models.  Some level of asynchronous
    progress is required to ensure that the examples in clauses 6 and
    7 are conforming.  Developing the formal data consistency and
    progress models is left until the integration of these facilities
    into ISO/IEC 1539-1."

[3:3+] 3 Terms and definitions, after paragraph 1, add a new subsection

    "3.x
     asynchronous progress
     ability of images to define or reference coarrays without
     requiring the images on which the data reside to execute any
     particular statements"

[17:20-21] 7.2 Atomic subroutines, delete paragraph 2.
