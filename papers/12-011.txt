A. Introduction
---------------

This document lists the technical issues raised by the editor with the
current working document, standing document 007.

Issues are separated into two lists; the resolved ones and the unresolved
ones.  When an issue is resolved, the J3 note in SD-007 will be deleted and
the item moved from the unresolved list to the resolved list.  Issue
numbers will not be reused.

The one-line description is just a hint as to the issue, not a
comprehensive statement of it.

Currently there are no unresolved issues, as work on a new revision has
not begun.


B. Unresolved issues
--------------------

None.


C. Resolved issues
------------------

None.
