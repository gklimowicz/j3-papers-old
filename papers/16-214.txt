Discussion:
-----------

The Result value section for IMAGE_INDEX:

 If the value of SUB is a valid sequence of cosubscripts for COARRAY
 in the team specified by TEAM or the current team if TEAM does not
 appear, the result is the index of the corresponding image in that
 team. Otherwise, the result is zero.

appears to overlook the option of specifying a team using the
TEAM_NUMBER argument. A correction is supplied.



Edit to J3/16-007r1:
--------------------

[386:25] In the Result value section of 13.9.97 IMAGE_INDEX ...,
change "TEAM or the current team if TEAM does not appear" to "TEAM or
TEAM_NUBER, or the current team if neither TEAM nor TEAM_NUMBER
appears".
