Subject: UK-03 - RECL for unlimited records
Date: 2013 October 14

Requirements and rationale
--------------------------
   See N1975.

Specification
--------------
   Standardize the value that will be returned by INQUIRE RECL= for
   files connected for stream access, with a single value that will be
   returned by all processors.

   In order to standardise the RECL= value fully, also standardise the
   return value for no connection.

Syntax
------
   The value shall be -1 for an unconnected unit, and -2 for a unit that
   is connected for stream access.

Edits (relative to 10-007r1)

     After "no connection,"
     "or" -> the  <scalar-int-variable> is assigned the value -1, and"
     "becomes undefined" ->"is assigned the value -2".
   [455:30] Remove an item from the list of events that might cause a
            variable to become undefined by deleting ", RECL=,".
