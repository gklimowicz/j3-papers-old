STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
JP-31)
  The fourth sentence of 10.8 and sixth sentence of 10.9:

  "Each value is either a null value or one of the forms:
        c
        r*c
        r*
   where c is a literal constant or a nondelimited character constant
   and r is an unsigned, nonzero, integer literal constant."

  "a literal constant" should be "an optionally signed literal
  constant"

ANSWER: Add the phrase, "if integer or real" to that last phrase
        above.

EDIT:
[175:5]  Replace "constant or" by "constant, optionally signed if
         integer or real, or"
[178:40] Replace "constant and" by "constant, optionally signed if
         integer or real, and"

Note for F2000:  The phrase "literal constant" [73:34] in F95 is not
                 the BNF term <lit-constant> but F95 doesn't say if
                 "literal constant" is signed.
