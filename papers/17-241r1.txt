Subject: scale factors do not affect integers
Date: 2017 October 18



Introduction

Comment GB048 remarks that the description of the scale factor
and G formatting allows a kP to appear with a G edit descriptor.
But kP does not apply to integer editing.

This should be stated in the description of the P editing.

While checking the edits, note was made that there is a typo
in the discussion of P.  An edit is supplied to repair this.
Specifically, the punctuation following EX is "."
where "," is intended.


Edits

{against 17-007r2}

{13.8 P editing}

[284:14]

Change "numeric"
to "real and complex"

[284:14] change "EX." to "EX,"

The resulting sentence will read
"The scale factor affects the editing done
by the F, E, EN, ES, EX, D, and G edit descriptors
for real and complex quantities."

{exclude I from the effects of P}
