Subject:    POS= specifier and stream access
Reference:  15-226, 16-007
Date: 2016 January 25

1. Introduction
===============

The constraints on R913 and subclause 9.6.2.11 do not limit the POS=
specifier to formatted data transfer. Therefore the description of
positioning in 9.3.3.4 should apply in both the formatted and
unformatted cases.

2. Edits
========

[206:31-32 9.3.3.4p4] Copy the fifth list item, beginning "If
it is possible to position the file," to be the final list item at
[206:21+ 9.3.3.4p3].

3. Alternative edits
====================

[206:12+] Insert a paragraph:

"While a file that can be positioned is connected for stream access, the
file position can be set to a position that was previously identified by
the POS= specifier in an INQUIRE statement."

[206:31-32 9.3.3.4p4] Delete the fifth list item, beginning "If it is
possible to position the file,...."
