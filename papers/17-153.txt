Subject:    Constraints on default pointer component initialization
References: 17-007r1

1. Discussion
=============

If one searches for <initial-data-target> to try to determine the
requirements on the target of pointer component initialization, one
might not find them because they are related to the <designator> that is
the <initial-data-target>.

C765 is a constraint on <component-name> but it is connected to R743, in
which <component-name> does not appear.

2. Edits without technical content
==================================

[78:16-17 C765 7.5.4.6 Default initialization for components]  Delete
"(R743)".  After "If <initial-data-target> appears" insert "in
<component-initialization> in a <component-decl>" so that the constraint
becomes

"C765 If <initial-data-target> appears in <component-initialization> in
      a <component-decl>, <component-name> shall be data-pointer-
      initialization compatible with the <initial-data-target>."

[78:18 C766 7.5.4.6 Default initialization for components] Replace
"(R744) The <designator>" with "A <designator> that is an
<initial-data-target>" so that the constraint begins

"C766 A <designator> that is an <initial-data-target> shall designate a
      nonallocatable...."
