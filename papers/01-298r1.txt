Subject:  Remove bindname

Wg5 resolution L4 in N1443 endorsed N1462, which, among other
things, suggested removing BINDNAME.  Although there is some
use for the feature, it is not adequately explained in the
draft and would require work to fix.  The feature is inherently
nonportable anyway and can be done as a processor extension.
J3 voted unanimously on the specs of J3/01-298 (to remove
bindname).  The edits to do it are:

  {Without bindname, the <bind-spec-list> always consists of
  exactly one <bind-spec>.  We can simplify by collapse out the
  bnf term for <bind-spec>.  Other edits below easly fix the few
  uses of that term.  The result ends up easier to read.}

  [70:20] "<bind-spec-list>" ->
     "NAME = <scalar-char-initialization-expr>"
  [70:21-25] Delete R514, C542, C543
  [70:26] "R514" -> "R513"

  {Delete references to bindname}
  [246:25-26] Delete C1216.
  [258:26-35] Delete C1240 and note 12.35.
  [264:15-31] Delete para and note 12.42.
  [363:35-37] Delete para

  {Fix references to <bind-spec>}
  [65:23],[79:5] "<bind-spec-list>" -> "NAME= specifier"
  [258:22] "<bind-spec>" -> "NAME= specifier"
  [70:26] Delete "in a <bind-spec>"  (The R513 ref covers this).

  {Improve exposition while fixing <bind-spec> references.  Combine
  C1217 and C1218.  It was particularly strange that C1217 talked
  about "any procedure entity" in a context where C1218 says there
  can be only one.}
  [246:27-30] replace C1217-C1218 with
    "C1217 (R1211) If a <language-binding-spec> with a NAME= is
            specified, then <proc-decl-list> shall contain exactly
            one <proc-decl>, which shall neither have the POINTER
            attribute nor be a dummy procedure."
