From:      Van Snyder
Subject:   Branching to END BLOCK and END CRITICAL
Date: 2014 October 02
Reference: 14-191r3

14-191r3 proposed to prohibit to branch to END BLOCK or END CRITICAL
statements from outside the constructs they terminate.  It also proposed
that existing prohibitions on branching to statements that terminate
constructs, from outside the constructs, ought to be constraints.  The
editor rejected 14-191r3 on the grounds that these proposals were not
authorized as work items, that the incompatibilites and additional
constraints proposed address mere oversigits or mistakes, and that they
therefore ought to be corrected by the interpretation process.

NUMBER: TBD
TITLE: Branching to END BLOCK and END CRITICAL
KEYWORD: Branching, END BLOCK, END CRITICAL
DEFECT TYPE: Error
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Do the GO TO statements in the following conform to the Fortran 2008
standard?

  go to 1
  do block
1 end block

  go to 2
  critical
2 end critical

  go to 3
  associate ( ... )
3 end associate

ANSWER:

Branching to END BLOCK and END CRITICAL statements from outside the
construct is not prohibited.

The GO TO statements that branch to statements 1 and 2 are not
prohibited.

This is considered to be a mistake.

Branching to the terminating statement of any other construct from
outside the construct is prohibited, but the prohibitions are not
constraints.

The GO TO Statement that branches to statement 3 is prohibited, but a
processor is not required to diagnose this violation.

It is considered to be a mistake that a processor is not required to
diagnose this violation.

Edits are provided to constrain against branching to these statements.
