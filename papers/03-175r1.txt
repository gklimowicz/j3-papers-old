Subject:  Action on Australian comment

WG5 delegated to J3 the handling of the first three informal
comments from Australia.  Those comments are detailed in WG5
paper N1499.

I propose that we make no edits in response to these comments.

The second edit appears to be suggesting that a requirement be
stated in Annex C.  Annex C is informative and is not a suitable
place for requirements.  Such a requirement would also invalidate
existing compilers, making it a significant technical change in
requirements and causing several objections.

The other two edits propose that the standard make
recommendations about implementations.  The level of detail in
these recommendations is not consistent with the level of detail
that the standard discusses for other comparable issues.  For
example, the standard does not make any recommendations about the
extensions used for object file names or the content of object
files.
