Date: 10 March 2003

1. Introduction

Comment MTC9 was

    Allow for IEEE extended format

    IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE and IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND should handle
    IEEE 754 compliant "extended" types.  We see no need to make a
    distinction between the extended and non-extended IEEE types here.

2. Edits to 02-007r3

[360:18] Change "IEEE single or IEEE double"
         to     "an IEEE floating-point format".
{Allow support of any IEEE-compliant type.}
