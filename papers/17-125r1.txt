Discussion
----------
If TEAM_NUMBER is invoked for the initial team, the value returned is
-1, which is not valid as a team number in an image selector or an
invocation of IMAGE_INDEX or NUM_IMAGES. These inconsistencies
disappear if the value 1 is returned by TEAM_NUMBER instead of -1.
We allow a CHANGE TEAM construct to keep all the images of the current
team in the new team and in this case they all have the same team
number. For consistency, we should treat the initial team similarly.

While working on the edits, we noticed that in 5.3.4 the initial team
is not defined as the team existing at the beginning of program
execution, although it is so defined in the terms section. We have
corrected this.
