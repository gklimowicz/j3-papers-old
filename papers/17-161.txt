Subject: STAT argument for atomics

Discussion:
-----------

17-007r1 does not say that if a coindexed argument of an atomic
subroutine is on a failed image and there is a STAT argument, it is
given the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE. An edit is supplied to do this.

Edit to 17-007r1:
------------------

[345:6-7] In 16.5 Atomic subroutines, para 5, delete
"processor-dependent" and add sentences
"If a coindexed argument is on a failed image, the value is
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. Otherwise,
the value is processor dependent."
