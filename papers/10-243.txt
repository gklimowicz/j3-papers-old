QUESTION:

Consider

  MODULE m
    TYPE t(n)
      INTEGER,LEN :: n
      REAL v(n)
    END TYPE
  END

Is the example intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, the example is standard-conforming in F2008.

C531 in section 5.3.8.2 [94:15-16] of 10-007 says:

 "C531 (R516) An explicit-shape-spec whose bounds are not constant
  expressions shall appear only in a subprogram, derived type
  definition, BLOCK construct, or interface body."
