Discussion
----------

J3 document 13-251 is the initial draft of the Coarray TS. It
incorporates 12-201 (the partial TS at the end of meeting 199) and
13-231r5 (teams) and 13-232r2 (events).  In the process of integrating
these, some editorial problems were noted and fixed as described
below. Additionally, three technical issues are noted at the end of
this paper. Changes were not made for these cases as part of 13-251.


Editorial Fixes made to 13-251.pdf
----------------------------------

1) The Rule number R507 appeared twice. The first was a mistake. When
the section was entered into the TS, automatic rule numbering fixed
the problem. {Fix typo in 13-231r5}

2) In the edit for [13:16+] two instances of "ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
(13.8.2)" needed the reference removed since this is not a subclause
number of the TS. (These were put back in the clause 8 edits.) {Fix
oversight in 13-231r5.}

3) In the first clause 8 edit in 13, the number of paragraphs in 7.2
is now 6, not 2.  Changed "two" to "six". {Missing edit.}

4) Add clause 8 edit to the first paragraph of 13.1, to add
"collective subroutine" to the list of classes of intrinsics. {Missing
edit.}

5) Changed the form of the second edit in 13.1 to be inserted text, so
that the references could be made appropriate to F2008.

6) Regularize the style of several edits in clause 8.

7) In the TEAM_DEPTH() example code, there was a missing ",INTRINSIC
::" in the USE statement. {Fix program example.}

8) Added "statement" after EVENT POST and EVENT WAIT title lines to be
consistent with clause 5 and F2008. {Fix style inconsistency.}

9) In 6.2p1 changed "on" to "and" between EVENT_TYPE and
LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE. (Fix typo in 13-232r3).

10) Add "EVENT_QUERY" to list of new intrinsics in the first sentence
of 7.1. {Omission in 13-232r3}.

11) For the clause 8 edits that move 5.2 TEAM_TYPE and 6.2 EVENT_TYPE
and LOCAL_EVENT_TYEP to 13.8.x, the moved text needs to omit the final
sentences of the initial paragraphs that say the names are defined in
the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module. {Oversight correction.}

12) In the clause 8 edit for 8.5.7 para 1,2, remove the reference for
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, as there is a reference already for ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
and no reference for STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE. {Fix style consistency in
13-231r5}

13) In R503, change end-team-construct-name to
team-construct-name. {Fix clearly wrong syntax in 13-231r5}

14) In 3 and the corresponding edits in 8, reorder the terms under
'team' to be alphabetical. {Fix style in 13-231r5.}



Technical issues. Page/line numbers refer to 13-251.
----------------------------------------------------

1) The Introduction (page iv) should be expanded to mention the
facilities for detecting and identifying failed images.

2) [13:3-5] 6.1 should mention the EVENT_QUERY intrinsic subroutine.

3) [14:6] The sentence "Unsuccessful .. count." should be reworded to
be parallel to the corresponding sentence at [13:31].
