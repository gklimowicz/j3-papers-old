Discussion
----------

It was intended that ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, and the synchronization
statements continue to work on active images in the presence of failed
images. This is in the hope that the user can arrange for the
calculation to continue in this case. It is confusing to describe such
executions as successful. The solution seems to be to describe these
as erroneous but nevertheless to specify that when STAT_FAILED_IMAGE
is returned the expected actions will have occurred on the active
images.

We also replace the paragraphs that define the effect of an error in
the ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE statements by a single paragraph for both,
for consistency with the way the ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE statements
are described together in 6.7.4.


Edits to J3/16-007r1
--------------------

[133:14-16] In 6.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, delete

[136:21+] In 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 2, delete UTI 16.

[137:4] In 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, after the first sentence add
"Otherwise, if a failed image is detected and no other error condition
occurs, the allocations or deallocations shall be performed on all the
active images of the current team and the STAT= specifier is assigned
the value of the named constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic
module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."

[137:6] In 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, at the end of the second
sentence add "and STAT_FAILED_IMAGE".

[137:6] In 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, at the start of the third
sentence change "In either case" to "For an error condition for which
the STAT= specifier is assigned a value other than STAT_FAILED_IMAGE".

[137:12+] At the end of 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, before NOTE 6.25, add
para "The set of error conditions for an ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE
statement is processor dependent. If an error condition occurs
during execution of an ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement that does not
contain the STAT= specifier, error termination is initiated.
