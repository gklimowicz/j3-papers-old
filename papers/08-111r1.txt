Discussion:

Note 9.23 at the end of 9.5.6 Open, was not updated to reflect the
change to the treatment of preconnected units introduced in
07-008. Except in the three noted cases, bu default preconnected units
are now local to each image, and are no longer restricted as indicated
in the note. On the whole, the note is no longer needed.


Edits to 08-007:

[228:13+] Delete Note 9.23 at the end of 9.5.6 OPEN statement.
