Discussion
----------

Paper 16-208r2 dealt with UTI 25 by rewriting the STAT= and ERRMSG=
paragraphs from TS18508. However a sentence [TS 38:33-34] got
overlooked. This paper restores the sentence.

Edits to 16-007r1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After applying the [209:1-9] edit from 16-208r2, insert a new paragraph
after paragraph 2 of the new text:

"After execution of an image control statement with a STAT= specifier
 that is not a SYNC MEMORY statement, all failed images involved in
 the statement shall be known by the executing image to have failed."
