OpenACC
=======

Information about OpenACC, including the current standard document,
training materials, and upcoming events can be found at
http://www.openacc.org/.

Jack Wells, Oak RIdge Leadership Computing Facility's Drector of
Science has been named tot he newly-created Vice President position.

In other news, NVIDIA announced they would be providing OpenACC
support on Arm processors.

The current OpenACC standard is version 2.7. It includes the following
changes beyond version 2.6:
1. Make it clear that the host can be a device.
2. Listing which fortran intrinsics and math.h functions
   should be supported.
3. Fortran bindings for API routines.
4. Treat reduction as a data clause (for parallel loop reduction).
5. Clarify that the host data construct used without "use device"
   means nothing
6. Array reductions
7. "acc parallel self" - run this in parallel on the current device

Version 2.7 of the OpenACC specification can be found at
https://www.openacc.org/specification.

There are over 110 applications in production or development using
OpenACC, including:
    - Gaussian 16
    - ANSYS Fluent
    - VASP
    - MPAS-A
    - COSMO
    - GAMERA for GPU
    - Quantum Espresso


The OpenACC annual meeting will be September 2, 2019 in Kobe, Japan.
There will also be a GPU Bootcamp at RIKEN R-CCS, September 3, 2019,
RIKEN R-CCS, Kobe, Japan.

There are more "hackathons" coming up in 2019, where researchers
bring their codes to work alongside with OpenACC experts to
accelerate their applications. Event dates are posted at
https://www.openacc.org/events.
