1. Introduction

There appears to be no prohibition against the same name being used as an
<associate-name> several times in the same ASSOCIATE statement; this would
appear to be an oversight.

There appears to be no requirement that the same procedure have the same
binding label in different interface blocks (in different scoping units);
this would also appear to be an oversight.

2. Edits to 03-007

[163:3+] Insert new constraint
  "C808a (R818) An <associate-name> shall not be the same as another
   <associate-name> in the same <associate-stmt>."
               
[407:24] Append to paragraph
  "A global entity of the program shall not be identified by more than one
   binding label."
