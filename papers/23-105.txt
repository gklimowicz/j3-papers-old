From: Van Snyder
Subject: Two intrinsic functions EXPM1 and LOGP1
Date: 2023-January-12

13.7.58a EXPM1 (X)

Description. Exponential function of X, less 1.

Class. Elemental function.

Argument.  X shall be of type real.

Result characteristics.  Same as X.

Result value.  The result has a value equal to a processor dependent
approximation to $e^{X}-1$.

Example.  EXPM1(1.0E-11) has the value 1.0E-11 (approximately).

NOTE 16.xxx
It is recommended that the result be calculated using a method that
does not incur loss of precision by forming $e^X$ and then
subtracting 1.

Note to J3: EXP(1.0E-11) has the value 1.0 + 1.0E-11 to first order.
This is 1.0 in IEEE single precision, so EXP(1.0E-11)-1.0 has the
value 0.0 in IEEE single precision, not the more correct value 1.0E-11.

13.7.98a LOGP1 (X)

Description.  Natural logarithm of X+1.

Class.  Elemental function.

Argument.  X shall be of type real.

Result characteristics.  Same as X.

Result value.  The result has a value equal to a processor dependent
approximation to $\log_e^{X+1}$.

NOTE 16.xxx
It is recommended that the result be calculated using a method that
does not incur loss of precision by forming X+1.

Example.  LOGP1(1.0E-11) has the value 1.0e-11 (approximately).

Note to J3: 1.0 + 1.0E-11 has the value 1.0 in IEEE single precision,
so LOG(1.0 + 1.0E-11) has the value 0.0 in IEEE single precision, not
the more correct value 1.0e-11.
