Subject: STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE and C's exit()

The current standard requires SYNC ALL and SYNC IMAGES statements with
the STAT= specifier to return with a status of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE if
another image has initiated a normal termination.  This seems reasonable
except it includes the normal terminations initiated by a C's exit()
function.  A Fortran implementation on SYNC ALL and SYNC IMAGES in general
can not understand the termination from a C's exit function call.
Therefore the exit() function from C should be excluded from the list of
normal terminations that is listed in 8.5.7.

EDIT:

    [196:5] 8.5.7 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control statements
    Change from
            "an image that has initiated termination"
    to
            "an image that has initiated a normal termination that is not
             by executing C exit function"
