Here is a draft response for F03/0037, with thanks to Malcolm Cohen
for his help.

NUMBER:  F03/0037
TITLE:  IEEE_RINT()
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, rint()
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation 
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

What is RINT(+infinity)?  RINT(-infinity)?  RINT(NaN)?

DISCUSSION:

RINT(X) when X is an infinity shall be X.

RINT(X) when X is a NaN shall be a NaN, and should be the NaN
argument.

ANSWER:

The second and third paragraphs of 14.8 state

"The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN is provided to inquire 
whether the processor supports IEEE NaNs. Where these are supported, 
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic 
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard.

The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_INF is provided to inquire whether 
the processor supports IEEE infinities. Where these are supported, 
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic 
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard. "

Therefore, the behaviour of IEEE_RINT for the cases cited here is as 
defined by the IEEE International Standard.

EDITS: None.
