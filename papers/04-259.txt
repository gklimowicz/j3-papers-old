Title:                Field and Record Justification

Submitted By:    Craig Dedo

Status:            For Consideration

Basic Functionality:
    Fortran should provide edit descriptors which allow the user to
specify whether a particular field is right justified, center justified,
or left justified.  If justification is not specified, it would default
to the current rules.

Rationale:
    The current Fortran 95 standard and the Fortran 2003 FCD only allow
justification as defined by the standard.  If the programmer could
specify field and record justification, s/he could produce much better
aligned output with much less effort.  Right now, it takes quite a lot
of effort on the programmer's part in order to justify output,
especially if it is to be centered on a record.

Estimated Impact:
    Likely minimal.  The existence of this feature in almost all word
processing and spreadsheet software indicates that the algorithms are
already highly developed and well known.

Detailed Specification:
    One method would be to precede each field with JR for right
justification, JL for left justification, and JC for center
justification, with the target field immediately following in
parentheses.  Specifying JR, JC, or JL at the beginning of a record
could specify justification for entire records.  Investigation may
reveal more effective methods for implementing each of these features.
