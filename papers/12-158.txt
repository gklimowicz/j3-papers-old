KEYWORDS: Abstract type, array constructor

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Question:

Is the following program intended to be standard conforming?
If so, what is its expected output?

module m
  abstract interface
    integer function afoo()
    end function
  end interface

  type, abstract :: abstract_base
    integer i
  contains
    procedure(afoo), nopass, deferred :: foo
  end type

  type, extends(abstract_base) :: child
    integer j
  contains
    procedure, nopass :: foo => foo_child
  end type
contains
  integer function foo_child()
    foo_child = 1
  end function
end module

use m
implicit none
class(abstract_base), allocatable :: x, y(:)
allocate(x, source=child(1,2))
allocate(y(1), source=[x])
select type(y)
  type is (child)
    print *, y
  class is (abstract_base)
    print *, y(1)%i
end select
print *, y(1)%foo()
end

Discussion:

Fortran 2008 (and an interp of Fortran 2003) specify the relationship
between the declared and dynamic types of an array constructor and the
declared type of its ac-value.  Specifically,
section 4.8 "Construction of array values" of Fortran 2008 states:

"2 If type-spec is omitted, each ac-value expression in the array
constructor shall have the same length type parameters; in this case,
the declared type and type parameters of the array constructor are
those of the ac-value expressions."

"4 The dynamic type of an array constructor is the same as its
declared type."

In the above program, the declared type of the ac-value is abstract.
The two rules above make the dynamic type of the array
constructor [x] abstract and cause y to have an abstract dynamic type.

There is a constraint in the standard to forbid this situation for
the unlimited polymorphic case:

"C4106 (R472) An ac-value shall not be unlimited polymorphic."

But I don't see one to forbid it for the abstract type case.

ANSWER:

This was not intentional.  A new constraint should be added to forbid
an ac-value to have an abstract declared type.

EDITS:

Change C4106 (R472)
from:
"C4106 (R472) "An <ac-value> shall not be unlimited polymorphic."
to:
"C4106 (R472) "An <ac-value> shall not be unlimited polymorphic or of
an abstract type."
