Subject:  Fortran Character Set

For use with Interval Arithmetic and in other features to be determined
later, the following extensions to the Fortran Character set are proposed:

 1.  The characters "[" and "]" also known as the "Left Square Bracket"
     and the "Right Square Bracket" respectively.  These characters are
     intended to be used somewhat like parentheses in a manner to be
     determined later.  They are not intended to occur in variable names,
     operator names, or in other places wherein an alphanumeric character
     may occur.

 2.  The characters "{" and "}" also known as the "Left Curly Bracket"
     and the "Right Curly Bracket" respectively.  These characters are
     intended to be used somewhat like parentheses in a manner to be
     determined later.  They are not intended to occur in variable names,
     operator names, or in other places wherein an alphanumeric character
     may occur.

 3.  The character "@" also known as the "Commercial At."  This character
     will be used in a manner to be determined later.  It is not intended
     to occur in variable names.

 4.  The character "#" also known as the "Number Sign."  This character
     will be used in a manner to be determined later.  It is not intended
     to occur in variable names.

 5.  The character "\" also known as the "Reverse Slant."  This character
     will be used in a manner to be determined later.  It is not intended
     to occur in variable names.

 6.  The character "~" also known as the "Tilde."  This character will be
     used in a manner to be determined later.  It is not intended to occur
     in variable names.

 7.  The character "`" also known as the "Grave Accent."  This character
     will be used in a manner to be determined later.  It is not intended
     to occur in variable names.

 8.  The character "|" also known as the "Vertical Bar."  This character
     will be used in a manner to be determined later.  It is not intended
     to occur in variable names.
