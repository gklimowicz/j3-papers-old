Subject:    <action-stmt> syntax rule
References: 16-007r2
Date: 2016 October 11
1. Introduction
---------------

C501 excludes <end-function-stmt>, <end-mp-subprogram-stmt>,
<end-program-stmt>, and <end-subroutine-stmt> from R509
<execution-part>, which eventually includes <action-stmt> in R1139
<if-stmt>. C1142 excludes them from <action-stmt>.

The only places where <execution-part> appears in a syntax rule (and
those statements are therefore excluded), those statements appear later
in the same syntax rule, after a <contains-part>.

The only place where <action-stmt> is part of a syntax term excludes
those statements.

The only place where these statements being part of <action-stmt> is
important is in the list of branch target.

It would be clearer not to have them listed as part of the <action-stmt>
syntax rule, and then have them excluded by constraints everywhere the
syntax rules would have them appear.

2. Edits
--------

[7:37-41 3.19 "branch target statement"] and
[204:4-6 11.2.1p1 "Branch concepts"]
  Insert "<end-function-stmt>, <end-mp-subprogram-stmt>,
          <end-program-stmt>, <end-subroutine-stmt>"
  in the lists in alphabetical order.

[21:10 3.136.1 "executable statement"] at the beginning of the line,
  insert "one of the statements <end-function-stmt>,
          <end-mp-subprogram-stmt>, <end-program-stmt>, or
          <end-subroutine-stmt>, or a "
  so the section reads:

    3.136.1
    executable statement
    one of the statements <end-function-stmt>, <end-mp-subprogram-stmt>,
    <end-program-stmt>, or <end-subroutine-stmt>, or a statement that is a
    member of the syntactic class executable-construct,  excluding those in
    the <block-specification-part> of a BLOCK construct

[37:39-42 5.1 "High level syntax": "R515 action-stmt"]
  Delete "<<or>> <end-function-stmt>" ... <<or>> <end-subroutine-stmt>".

[38:19-20 "5.1 High level syntax": "C501"] Delete C501.

[196:4-5 C1142 11.1.8.4 IF statement C01"]
  Delete "<end-function-stmt> ... or".
