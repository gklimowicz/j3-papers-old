1. Introduction
===============

This was originally in 14-143r1, which didn't get processed at 204.

4.5.2.2p1 is nearly identical to the first two sentences of 5.3.2p2, the
only difference being that 4.5.2.2p1 is specialized for type names
instead of identifiers.

There are cross references from 9.11.5 to 13.8.2.13 and 13.8.2.14 for
IOSTAT_END and IOSTAT_EOR, but none to 13.8.2.15 for
IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT.

Note 13.1 uses the term "atomic variables", but this term is not used
anywhere else (because Fortran has no such concept).  It should be
"variables using atomic subroutines".

That the effects of calling COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT,
EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE, GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, and
GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE on any image other than image 1 [in the initial
team after TS 81508] are processor dependent, is discussed in 13.5p3.
Subclause 13.5 should contain only summaries and generalities, not
specifics.  Considerations concerning invoking a procedure on other than
image 1 [in the initial team after TS 81508] ought to be discussed in
descriptions of the individual procedures, in subclauses 13.7.37,
13.7.58, 13.7.66, 13.7.67, and 13.7.68.

The interleaving of calls to any procedure in unordered segments is
processor dependent (although a standard-conforming program cannot
observe this).  It does not depend upon whether a processor uses a
common random number generator.  The final sentence of 13.5p4 is not
even informative.  Indeed, one might wonder "Since it's said here and
not elsewhere, is it perhaps untrue elsewhere?"

That the results of CPU_TIME, DATE_AND_TIME, and SYSTEM_CLOCK might be
dependent on which image calls them, is discussed in 13.5p5.
Similarly, these discussions ought to be in subclauses 13.7.43, 13.7.45,
and 13.7.167.

13.5p6 doesn't say anything useful, since the consideration applies to
all procedures, not only "all other standard intrinsic procedures."

An ASSOCIATE CONSTRUCT might have several associations; "the associate
name" is therefore ambiguous.

The list items at [482:38-40] concerning subclause 13.7.67 are followed
by items with smaller subclause numbers.  They should be put into
subclause order.

2. Edits to 14-007r2
====================

[64:23-25] Delete 4.5.2.2p1.

[64:26 4.5.2.2p2]  Prepend a sentence:

"Accessibility of a type name is determined as specified in 5.3.2."

[244:5-6 9.11.5p1 second list item] After IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT
insert "(13.8.2.15)" for consistently with [244:10] and [244:12].  Delete
"from the intrinsic module IOSTAT_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2)".

[321:16 13.1p3] Replace "atomic variables" with "affected variables".
(The term "atomic variables" is not defined or used elsewhere in the
standard.)

[321:17+2 Note 13.1] Replace "use atomic variables" with "use atomic
subroutines".

[329:1-3 13.5p3] Delete the paragraph.  The description reappears later.

[329:7-8 13.5p4] Delete "On images ... dependent."  The description
reappears later.

[329:9-330:2 13.5p5-6] Delete the paragraphs and Note 13.8.  The
descriptions reappear later.

[344:2 13.7.37p1] Replace description with "Number of program invocation
command arguments"

[344:6-9 13.7.37p5] Replace paragraph with:

    "Result value: The result value is the number of available arguments
    on the command that invoked the program. If there are no command
    arguments available, or if the processor does not support retrieval
    of a command argument count on the invoking image, then the result
    has the value zero. If the processor has the concept of a command
    name, the command name does not count as one of the command arguments.
    The manner in which command arguments are distinguished is processor
    dependent. Whether or not all images return the same number of
    arguments is processor dependent."

[346:6+ 13.7.43p3] Append a sentence:

  "Whether the value assigned to TIME depends upon which image invokes
   the subroutine is processor dependent.  Whether the value assigned to
   TIME is a per-image value or per-program value is processor
   dependent."

[347:40+ 13.7.45p3+] Insert a paragraph:

   "A clock may be available on some images and not others.  If a clock
    is available on more than one image, it is processor dependent
    whether or not all images share the same clock or time zone
    information."

[353:12+ 13.7.58p5+] Append a paragraph:

  "Support for command-line execution and the interpretation of the
   COMMAND argument may be different on different images."

[356:23+ 13.7.66p3+] Append a paragraph:

   "Success of command line retrieval and the values assigned to the
   output arguments may vary across images."

[357:15+ 13.7.67p3+] Append a paragraph:

   "Success of command argument retrieval and the values assigned to the
   output arguments may vary across images. The manner in which command
    arguments are distinguished is processor dependent."

[358:6+ 13.7.68p3+] Append a paragraph:

   "Success of environment variable retrieval and the values assigned to
   the output arguments may vary across images."

[387:8+ 13.7.138p3] Append a sentence:

  "If images use a common random number generator, the sequences of
   values of the HARVEST argument in unordered segments are processor
   dependent."

[400:7 13.7.167p3] Replace "the processor clock" with "a processor
 clock"

[400:15+ 13.7.167p3+] Insert a paragraph:

  "The number of processor clocks is processor dependent.  Whether an
   image has no clock, has a clock of its own, or shares a clock with
   another image, is processor dependent."

[492:4-5 16.6.7p1(11)] Replace "the <selector>" with "a <selector>",
insert "corresponding" before "associate name", and delete "of that
construct", because an ASSOCIATE construct might have several
associations.

[496:35-37] Delete the bullet item. Insert into the list in subclause-
appropriate positions the following:

"o  Whether command line execution is supported, and the interpretation
    of command line execution in different images (13.7.58)"
"o  The manner in which command arguments are distinguished for
    invocations of COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT (13.7.37) and
    GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT (13.7.67)"
"o  Whether invocations of COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT (13.7.37),
    GET_COMMAND (13.7.66) or GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT (13.7.67) are supported,
    or return or assign consistent values, in different images.

[496:38-40] Move the two list items concerning subclause 13.7.67 to
[497:8+], being careful to put the subclause number order with
respect to the other items moved to the same place.

[496:41-42] Replace "whether" with "if RANDOM_INIT is not invoked,
whether".  Replace "13.5" with "13.7.138" and move the list item to
[497:8+], being careful to put it in subclause number order with respect
to the other items moved to the same place.

[497:1-2] Replace the list item with:

  "o  if images use a common random number generator, the sequences of
      values of the HARVEST argument resulting from invocations of
      RANDOM_NUMBER in unordered segments are processor dependent
      (13.7.138);"

Then move it to [497:8+], being careful to put it in subclause number
order with respect to the other items moved to the same place.

[497:3-4] Delete the item.

[497:8+] Insert list items being careful to put them in subclause number
order with respect to the other items moved to the same place:

  "o  Whether the value of the TIME argument of the CPU_TIME intrinsic
      subroutine (13.7.43) depends upon which image invokes the
      subroutine is processor dependent.  Whether the value of TIME is a
      per-image value or per-program value is processor dependent.

   o  Whether the values of the arguments of the DATE_AND_TIME intrinsic
      subroutine (13.7.46) depend upon which image invokes the
      subroutine is processor dependent.

   o  Whether the values of the arguments of the SYSTEM_CLOCK intrinsic
      subroutine (13.7.167) depend upon which image invokes the
      subroutine is processor dependent."
