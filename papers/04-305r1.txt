NUMBER: F90/000207
TITLE: Integer bit-model inconsistency
KEYWORDS: Bit manipulation procedures, models for integer data
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: Is the following observation true?

[F90 185:last sentence of 13.5.7] and [WG5/N1176, 219:22+] says ``In
particular, whereas the models are identical for w_{z-1}=0, they do
not correspond for w_{z-1}=1 and ...''

This statement assumes r==2 in the model for integer data defined in
 13.7.1, it is not true for general r. The above sentence should be
 changed to something like

``In particular, whereas the models are identical for r=2 and
  w_{z-1}=0, they do not correspond for r/=2 or w_{z-1}=1, and ...''

ANSWER: Yes.

DISCUSSION:

The integer model in 13.7.1 describes integer values using a
signed-magnitude, base r representation. The bit model in 13.5.7
describes a method for characterizing a sequence of bits. The two
models do not generally correspond and the final sentence of 13.5.7 is
defective.

EDITS: [219:22-24] Remove the sentence beginning "In particular..."
