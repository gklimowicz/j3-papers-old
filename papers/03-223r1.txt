          Typos and suggestions for small changes in J3/03-007

[12:27-29] Delete the second sentence of 2.2.3.2 because it is a 
misleading half truth.

[228:41]  "right-justified" -> "right justified"
[239:28]  "right-justified" -> "right justified"

[234:27]  "left-justified" -> "left justified"

[397:13]  "nonkind" -> "length"
          (Only occurrence in document of "nonkind")

[446:5]   "centeroid" -> "centroid"

[454:13] WG5 recommends that J3 review the style of the example in C.2.3.
Replace the example on [453:35 thru 454:19] with

SUBROUTINE TERMINATE_ITERATIONS

   LOGICAL, VOLATILE    ::    USER_HIT_ANY_KEY

!     Have the OS start to look for a user keystroke and set the variable
!     "USER_HIT_ANY_KEY" to TRUE as soon as it detects a keystroke.
!     This pseudo call is operating system dependent.
   CALL OS_BEGIN_DETECT_USER_KEYSTROKE( USER_HIT_ANY_KEY )

   USER_HIT_ANY_KEY = .FALSE.      ! This will ignore any recent keystrokes

   PRINT *, "Hit any key to terminate iterations!"

   DO I = 1,100
      ...                    ! Compute a value for R
      PRINT *, I, R
      IF (USER_HIT_ANY_KEY)     EXIT
   ENDDO

! Have the OS stop looking for user keystrokes
   CALL OS_STOP_DETECT_USER_KEYSTROKE

END SUBROUTINE TERMINATE_ITERATIONS
