Subject: Erroneous constraint in CRITICAL
Date: 2009 May 06
References:


Constraint C810 is not statically checkable, because the image control
statement may occur inside a subroutine whose code is not known to
the compiler.  It should not be a constraint.

Edits:

[174:18] In 8.1.5, after paragraph 1, change constraint 810 to be an
ordinary restriction by removing "C810 (R810)".
