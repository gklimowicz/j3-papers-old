Subject: Revision of INTERP F90/000070

NUMBER: F90/000070
TITLE: Characteristics specified by interface bodies
KEYWORDS: characteristics, array bounds, array shape, function result
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Section 12.3.2.2 indicates that an interface body specifies all of a
procedure's characteristics and that the characteristics must be
consistent with those in the procedure definition.  Are the following
code fragments standard conforming?

(a)      PROGRAM FRED
           INTERFACE
             SUBROUTINE SUB (ARR,J)
               INTEGER ARR(1:)
             END SUBROUTINE
           END INTERFACE
         INTEGER ARR(10)
         CALL SUB(ARR,2)
         END PROGRAM

         SUBROUTINE SUB(ARR, J)
           INTEGER ARR(J:)
           ...
         END SUBROUTINE SUB

(b)      FUNCTION C1( )
           CHARACTER(*) C1
           ...
         END FUNCTION C1
         FUNCTION C2(N)
           CHARACTER(N) C2
           ...
         END FUNCTION C2

         SUBROUTINE CALLER( )
           INTERFACE
             FUNCTION C1( )
               CHARACTER(*) C1
             END FUNCTION
             FUNCTION C2(N)
               CHARACTER(2) C2
             END FUNCTION
           END INTERFACE
           CHARACTER(5) CC
           CC=C1( )//C2(2)

ANSWER:

  (a)  This example is standard conforming.

  (b)  This example is not standard conforming.

Discussion:

(a) 12.2.1.1 states that the characteristics of a dummy data object
include its shape, and that if the shape is assumed then that is a
characteristic.  Section 2.4.5 states that the shape of an array is
determined by its rank and extent in each dimension (but not by its
bounds, 5.1.2.4.2).  Both the interface block for SUB and the
definition of SUB describe the shape of ARR as assumed, so they are
describing the same shape, and the program is standard conforming.

(b) Section 12.2.2 states that the characteristics of a function
include whether or not the function result value is a character of
assumed length.  So the interface body for function C1 must indicate
that C1 is of assumed length. However, item (3) in 5.1.1.5 indicates
that scoping units that invoke an external character function of
assumed length must have access to a declaration of the function name
with a length type parameter value other than *. This is explained in 
Note 5.6, (which has been removed in Fortran 2003).

In addition, the interface for C2 does not conform to the standard as
the length of C2 specified as 2 is not consistent with the length
specified as N within the function definition.
