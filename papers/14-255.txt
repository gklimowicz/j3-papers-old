1. Introduction
===============

C1302 says

 "A named variable of type LOCK_TYPE shall be a coarray.   A named
  variable with a noncoarray subcomponent of type LOCK_TYPE shall be a
  coarray."

The only places variables of type LOCK_TYPE can be manipulated are in
LOCK and UNLOCK statements.  Therefore, aside from "subcomponent" being
wrong, it would be more economical to require the <lock-variable> to be
a coarray or a coindexed object.

This would make the corrections to C1302 advocated in interp F08/0107
irrelevant to the next revision.

2. Edits
========

[195:8 C852] Insert "a coarray or coindexed object" after "shall be".

[480:17-18 C1302] Delete C1302.
