1. Introduction

This paper proposes fixes to two minor editorial glitches.


2. The problems.

One. ATOMIC_CAS has different argument names in Table 16.1 than what
     it has in its description. The description is assumed correct. (A
     an example test using keyword arguments for the names listed in
     the description compiles correctly with multiple compilers that
     have atomics implemented.)

Two. There is an extraneous closing parenthesis in a line of example code.


3. Edits to 18-007r1

[444:23] 17.11.7 IEEE_GET_MODES, p4 Example,
    Delete a closing parenthesis, leaving the line as:
        "CALL IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE (IEEE_TO_ZERO)".

[333] Table 16.1, ATOMIC_CAS entry,
      Change "VALUE" to "NEW".
{The argument names in the description are:
    "ATOM, OLD, COMPARE, NEW, STAT".}
