QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      MODULE m
        PRIVATE
        TYPE, PUBLIC :: t
          INTEGER :: i
          INTEGER :: j
        CONTAINS
          PROCEDURE, PRIVATE :: readFormatted => readFormattedT
          GENERIC :: READ(FORMATTED) => readFormatted
        END TYPE
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE readformattedT(dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
          CLASS(t),     INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
          INTEGER,      INTENT(IN)    :: unit
          CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
          INTEGER,      INTENT(IN)    :: v_list(:)
          INTEGER,      INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
          CHARACTER(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg
          READ (unit, *) dtv%i
          dtv%j = dtv%i * 2
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE
   
      PROGRAM p
        USE m
        TYPE(t) :: x
        NAMELIST /nml/ x
        READ (*, nml)
        PRINT *, x%i, x%j
      END PROGRAM

Question 1:
Is the following input valid for the above program?

&nml
 b1%i = 100
/

Question 2:
If the input is valid, what is the output of the program, when using
this input?


ANSWER:

1. No, this input is not valid for the given program.  The name of a
component of a structure should not appear in namelist input if that
structure would be processed by a user-defined derived-type I/O
procedure.  Edits are supplied to correct this oversight.

2. N/A

Replace
    "If the namelist group object name is the name of a variable of derived
     type, the name in the input record may be either the name of the variable
     or the designator of one of its components, indicated by qualifying the
     variable name with the appropriate component name."
with
    "If the namelist group object is a variable of derived type, the name in
     the input record may be the name of the variable.  If the variable would
     not be processed by a user-defined derived-type input/output procedure,
     the name in the input record may also be the designator of one of its
     components, using the syntax of object designators."
