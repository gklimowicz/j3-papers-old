Subject:  Minor spelling and wording edits

I ran a spell checker through the text version of the current
007 and here are the things it didn't like.  Words are given in
source text order without page and line numbers.  Richard told
me in a private communication that that was fine with him.  He'd
use a search and change editor option to fix them anyhow.

Mostly I just cut and pasted the incorrect spelling here with no
attempt to suggest a better spelling.

Once I found the first instance of an error I stopped looking for
that particular spelling.  So, there might be many instances of
"oject" in the text.

In a few cases I added comments, generally for things that aren't
pure spelling issues.

Should "multipart" be hyphenated?

In note 7.55
          A (I, J) = A(I, J-1) + A(I,J+1) + A(I-1,J) + A(I+1, J)
               #         #           ^            ^          #
I think we usually have a blank after the "," in subscripts

In note 8.7
          LEVEL=0
I think we usually have blanks on both side of the "=" sign;
I have to admit I haven't been
consistently looking for either of these things up til now.
And as I  look more, I think we are consistently inconsistent
with how we add spaces to things.  Unless Richard feels real
ambitious you can ignore this comment.

"sn" should be "an" in (8) just before 9.4

4 lines after C901 there is a "module module"

What does ST{...} mean?

Page 225, line 28, should "cr*c" be "r*c"?

Note 11.2  names are arbitrary, but should we replace
"ANALYSE" with ANALYZE" in 2 places?

note 12.27  should "nonpredictable" be "unpredictable"?  We get
acussed of inventing enough new stuff.

Page 262:24.  Is (4) hosed up?  What are the I16... things?

Note 12.43, fifth line.  Looks like the wrong kind of quotes to me.
I think I complained about this for something else, so it might just
be a fonting problem, or it might be a problem with the magic in going
from Frame to LaTex.

Maxloc example (ii) and (iii) there is a "the the"

representat      extra ta in first line of note 13.6; hard for me
                 to see because of the line break

In RANGE (iii)   "teh" => "the"

There is also an emIn in the example for selected_real_kind
TINY also has a reference to both bemIn and emIn
Is there a generic problem with "emin"?
