NUMBER: F08/0068
TITLE: Pointer association and extended type arrays
KEYWORDS: pointer association, extended type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Should a pointer that is pointer associated with a dummy array or an
element or section of a dummy array remain associated after return
from the procedure that contains the dummy array if the dummy array
is not polymorphic and the dynamic type of the effective argument of
the dummy array is not the same as the type of the dummy array?

ANSWER:

It was not intended to be possible for a nonpolymorphic dummy
argument to be associated with an effective argument with an
incorrect dynamic type.  An edit is supplied to fix this.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[292:16] 12.5.2.3p2,
  Change "the dummy" -> "a polymorphic dummy"
  Insert after "that target"
  "and a nonpolymorphic dummy argument becomes argument
   associated with the declared type part of that target".
Making the whole paragraph read:
  "If a nonpointer dummy argument without the VALUE attribute
   corresponds to a pointer actual argument that is pointer associated
   with a target, a polymorphic dummy argument becomes argument
   associated with that target and a nonpolymorphic dummy argument
   becomes argument associated with the declared type part of that
   target".

[292:18] p3
  Change "it" to ", a polymorphic dummy argument",
  Insert after "that actual argument"
  "and a nonpolymorphic dummy argument becomes argument associated
   with the declared type part of that actual argument".
Making the whole paragraph read:
  "If a present nonpointer dummy argument without the VALUE attribute
   corresponds to a nonpointer actual argument, a polymorphic dummy
   argument becomes argument associated with that actual argument and
   a nonpolymorphic dummy argument becomes argument associated with
   the declared type part of that actual argument".
