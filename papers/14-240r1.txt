Subject: Interpretation concerning variable definition context

NUMBER: F08/0118
TITLE: Subobject of variable in variable definition context
KEYWORD: subobject, variable definition context
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Does this program conform to the Fortran 2008 standard?

  type :: T
    integer :: C
  end type T

  type(t), parameter :: V = T(41)

  associate ( W => V )
1   w%c = 42
  end associate

  end

DISCUSSION:

Because the selector is not permitted to appear in a variable
definition context, the associate-name is not permitted to appear in a
variable definition context.  However, that does not affect subobjects
of the associate-name.

ANSWER:

The associate-name is not permitted to appear in a variable definition
context because no interpretation is established; however, it should
be explicitly stated that this is not permitted.  An edit is provided
to clarify this.
