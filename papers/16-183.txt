----------

The editor's change is unsatisfactory because it makes TEAM_TYPE too
special. Instead, we suggest that TEAM be required to be present if
COARRAY is of TEAM_TYPE.

Edit to J3/16-007r1
--------------------

[427-27-28] In 13.9.190 THIS_IMAGE ([TEAM]) ..., para 3, replace the
description of COARRAY by
"COARRAY shall be a coarray of any type. If it is allocatable, it shall
         be allocated. If it is of type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic
         module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, the argument TEAM shall be present."

[427-28+] In 13.9.190 THIS_IMAGE ([TEAM]) ... delete UTI 29.
