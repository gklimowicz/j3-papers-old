1.  Introduction

Bob Corbett has pointed out that although Constraints C1213-C1215 were
originally in Clause 16, they were not in 16.2 or 16.3, and therefore
a processor was not required by 1.4p2(6) to report violations of the
rules they specify.  Making them constraints imposes this requirement.

Do we want to require processors to report violations of these rules?

2.  We want to require processors to report violations of these rules

Edits: None

3.  We don't want to require processors to report violations of these
rules
