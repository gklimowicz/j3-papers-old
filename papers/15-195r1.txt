Introduction
------------

The Editor remarks in 15-184 that material the introductory paragraph
of subclause 10.8.1 Position Editing is badly organized.

The Editor also remarks that the character string editing discussion
(towards the end of subclause 10.3.2 page 250) is archaic.

This paper attempts to improve this situation.

Edits to 15-007r1
-----------------

[250:15] 10.3.2 Edit descriptors, p3
         Beginning of sentence "T, TL" -> "A T, TL",
         "and DP indicate" -> "or DP edit descriptor indicates".
{Singularise, use "edit descriptor".
 Actually T, TL, TR, X, slash, colon do not "indicate the manner of
 editing" ... do we care about this apparent untruth?}

[250:19] same subclause, p4
  after "Each <rep-char> in a character string edit descriptor shall be"
  delete "one of the characters"
  rest is "capable of representation by the processor.".

[250:21] same subclause, p6,
         "The character string edit descriptors provide"
         ->"A character string edit descriptor provides"
{Singular, indefinite.}

[250:22] same subclause, p7,
         "except for the characters in the character constants"
         -> "except within a character string edit descriptor".
{Singular, more accurate}

[262:25-26] 10.8.1.1 Position editing, p2,
  Replace entire paragraph
    "The position specified by a T ... editing."
  with
    "On input, if the position specified by a position edit descriptor is
     before the current position, portions of a record can be processed
     more than once, possibly with different editing."
{Delete misleading sentence and reword the rest.  The deleted sentence,
 with significant rewording, will reappear later.}

[262:27] same subclause, p3,
  Delete the first sentence "The position specified by an X ... position.".
{Entirely redundant as well as out of place.}

[262:28+1-2] same subclause, NOTE 10.23,
             Move note "An nX ... TRn edit descriptor."
             to 10.8.1.3 X editing, p1+, see below.
{move Note comparing X and T descriptors}

[262:21] 10.8.1.1p1,
         between "The" and "T, TL..." insert "position edit descriptors,",
         and change "X edit descriptors" to "X,".
{Simplify, singular}

[262:22,29,263:1,3] change remaining "T, TL, TR, or X" -> "position"
                    throughout subclause (i.e. 4 times)

[263:3-4] same subclause, p5,
          "record may" -> "record can",
          "However," ->"A",
          ". Such edit descriptors may" -> ", but it might".
That whole para will now read
  "On output, a character in the record can be replaced.  A position edit
   descriptor never directly causes a character already placed in the
   record to be replaced, however it might result in positioning such that
   subsequent editing causes a replacement."
{Simplify}

[263:12] 10.8.1.2 T, TL, and TR editing, p2,
         Append to paragraph
           "This position can be in either direction from the current
            position."
{Insert modified text we deleted earlier.}
