Subject: Coindexed actual arguments
Date: 2009/02/10


1. Discussion

It is undesirable to allow sequence association for actual arguments that
are coindexed array elements as this could require passing the whole rest
of the array (by copy-in/out) instead of just that element.

An edit is provided to eliminate this, by requiring the dummy argument to
be scalar if the actual argument is coindexed.  Sequence association only
comes into effect for dummy arrays ([303:4]), so there is no need to change
the definition of element sequence.


2. Edits to 09-007

[298:28-30] In 12.5.2.4 Ordinary dummy variables, para. 13, sentence 1,
  Change "If the actual argument is scalar,"
  to
    "If the actual argument is a coindexed scalar, the corresponding dummy
     argument shall be scalar.  If the actual argument is a noncoindexed
     scalar,".
