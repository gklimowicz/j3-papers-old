Subject:    Trivial syntactic sugar (feature creep) in CHANGE TEAM

1. Proposal
-----------

It is simple and useful to include the functionality of the ASSOCIATE
construct in the CHANGE TEAM construct.

2. Edits
--------

[185:9 R1112] Replace "<coarray-associaton-list>" with
"<team-association-list".

[185:10+ R1113+] Insert a syntax rule

"  R1113a <team-association> <<is>> <coarray-association>
                             <<or>> <association>
"

[185:25 C1117+] Maybe insert a constraint:

"C1117a (R1113a) A <selector> in an <association> shall not be a
coindexed object."

{This constrains against the same functionality that TEAM in an
<image-selector> provides, but doing it here means you needn't write it
there.  Don't insert the constraint if it's not clearly harmful to allow
it.}

[186:4+ 11.1.5.1p2] Insert a paragraph:

"Each <associate-name> in an <association> in the CHANGE TEAM statement
is an associate name that is associated with its corresponding
selector in the same way as in an ASSOCIATE construct (11.1.3.2)."

If constraint C1117a suggested above is not included, append a sentence
to this paragraph:

"If the <selector> in an <association> is a coindexed object, the
meaning of its <image-selector> is interpreted in the parent team; the
effect of the CHANGE TEAM construct does not change its interpretation."
