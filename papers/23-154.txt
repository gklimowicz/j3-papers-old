Introduction
-------------

At its February 2023 meeting (meeting #229), J3 (formally, 
INCITS/Fortran) collected lists of potential features to recommend to WG5 
for inclusion in Fortran 202Y from its subgroups (Data, HPC, JoR, and 
Generics). J3 called straw votes on the items in the lists.

Collected below are items that received positive responses (i.e. more 
"yes" than "no" and more "yes" than "undecided") from the straw votes. 
They are listed in no particular order. One sentence descriptions are 
provided for convenience where needed. Reader should consult the 
cited references for more context.


Data
-----------------------------

1. Namespace for modules
   Provide a "remote access" to access module entities, for e.g. 
   "modulename % entityname" (syntax here for illustrative purposes only).
  
2. More assumed-rank functionality
   Make assumed-rank more useful inside Fortran. 

3. Obsolete default implicit typing
  
4. Pointer intent (read-only pointer)

5. "Proper" enumeration types
   Provide additional functionality for our existing enumeration types.
   
6. Program-specified default KINDs for constants and intrinsic

 
HPC
------------------------------
1. BITS data
   Add an intrinsic type BITS to Fortran. 

2. BIND (Fortran, name= )
   Provide a way to specify the binding name for a Fortran program unit. 

3. Additional types to list of interoperable types
   See 22-185r1 for potential types.

4. Async tasking
   Provide a mechanism to do asynchronous tasking in Fortran. 
   See 22-169.pdf.


JoR
-------------------------
1. FPP - a preprocessor for Fortran

2. F.P. model
   Add note to the standard that this model is not the model any 
   particular hardware uses, and for floating point, is not the same as 
   IEEE 754.

3. Scan/prefix sum
   See 23-113

4. IEEE math intrinsic operations
   See 23-111r1

5. Deprecate D edit Descriptor

6. Source position
   Provide a way to retrieve the current position in a source file as 
   printable text or a value.

7. TABs in source code
   Treat TAB as space in source input. See 23-117.


Generics
-------------------------

1. Generic programming
   See 22-154r5, 22-120r5, 22-102 and references therein. 

2. Additional generics features
   See 23-148.
