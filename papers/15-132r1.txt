Subject: Changes to C_LOC in F2008

NUMBER: F08/0131
TITLE: Are the changes to C_LOC in the 2010 revision intentional?
KEYWORDS: C_LOC, interoperability
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The description of C_LOC in the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING permits
noninteroperable array arguments that are contiguous, provided the
type and kind are interoperable.  This was not permitted by the
previous revision of ISO/IEC 1539-1, which required all type
parameters to be interoperable (and only exempted allocatable arrays
from the "interoperable variable" requirement); however this is not
listed in the Introduction as a change.

For example, each of the following is apparently permitted by the
C_LOC requirements in Fortran 2008 but not in Fortran 2003:
  CHARACTER(13,C_char),TARGET :: x(100)
  CHARACTER(14,C_char),TARGET :: y
  REAL(C_float),CONTIGUOUS :: dummy1(:)
  INTEGER(C_int),CONTIGUOUS,POINTER :: z(:)
(the CONTIGUOUS attribute does not exist in Fortran 2003).
and also
  REAL(C_float) :: dummy2(:)
  INTEGER(C_int),POINTER :: z2(:)
when dummy1 is argument-associated with a contiguous array, and z2 is
pointer-associated with a contiguous array.

Was this change intended?

ANSWER:

Yes, this change was intentional.  An edit is provided to add this to
the Introduction.

EDITS:

[xvi] Introduction, "Intrinsic modules" bullet point,
  Before "The function C_SIZEOF"
  insert new sentence
    "A contiguous array that is not interoperable but which has
     interoperable kind and kind type parameter, and a scalar
     character variable with length>1 and kind C_CHAR, can be used as
     the argument of the function C_LOC in the intrinsic module
     ISO_C_BINDING, provided the variable has the POINTER or TARGET
     attribute."
