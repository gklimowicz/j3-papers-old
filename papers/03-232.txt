Eliminate the exception:

1.  75:34 After "with", insert "nonpolymorphic".

2.  272:42-273:2  Delete final sentence of paragraph.

3.  485:27-28,29-30,32-33,41-42 Change existing comment to

=======
Edits B
=======

Provide alternative functionality:

1.  59:18+  Insert new paragraph
     "Because the dynamic type of a polymorphic object may extend
     its declared type, polymorphic objects have an additional
     parent component whose name is that of the declared type of
     the object.  This component is nonpolymorphic, but otherwise
     its type and type parameters are the declared type and type
     parameters of the object.  If the dynamic type of the object
     is the same as its declared type, the component denotes the
     entire object; otherwise, it denotes the ancestor component
     in the dynamic type that denotes an object of the declared type."

2.  485:28+ Insert "CALL TUB2 ( P2%POINT ) ! Valid alternative to
     above"

3.  485:34-40 Do _not_ delete these lines as specified in A.
     Instead, replace "( P2 )" with "( P2%COLOR_POINT )".

4.  485:42+ Insert "CALL TUB3 ( P2%COLOR_POINT ) ! Valid
     alternative to above"

                               - end -
