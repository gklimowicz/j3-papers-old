    Unresolved Issue 359

To:         J3

Subject:    Unresolved issue 359

Introduction

Unresolved issue 359 (p. 294)
[Begin J3 note]
While entering paper 02-149, I noticed that there were similar
errors in 13.6, some dating back to f90.  We should either fix them
also or (my preference) delete the argument lists entirely from
13.6.  That's not where anyone looks for argument lists. besides,
deleting the argument lists would make the column headers (which
just say these are names) correct.
[End of J3 note]

An additional problem is that [72:16] asserts that the type of a
specific intrinsic function is listed in 13.6.  Only the argument
types, not the result types, are given in 13.6.

Edits

[294:9+1-6] [Editor: Replace unresolved issue note 359 with the
following:]

Except where the description of the generic reference form shows
that an explicit INT or REAL function is applied to the result of
the MAX or MIN generic function, the result type of the specific
function is the same as the result type of the corresponding
generic function if it were invoked with the same arguments as the
specific function.

[294-295:Table] Delete the parenthesized argument lists in the
first two columns, except for the four functions AMAX0, AMIN0,
MAX1, and MIN1.  For those four functions, replace the
parenthesized argument lists in both columns with "(...)".
