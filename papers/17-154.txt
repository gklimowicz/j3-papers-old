Discussion:
-----------

The description of the result value of the intrinsic TEAM_NUMBER is
broken. By "the team of the invoking image" we must mean the current
team or an ancestor of the current team. By "the team of the
invoking image within the specified team", we must mean the team
whose parent is the specified team. But the example and the use of
TEAM_NUMBER elsewhere in the standard show that we mean the team
number of the specified team within its parent.

For example, in 16.9.97 IMAGE_INDEX, we have
"TEAM_NUMBER shall be an integer scalar. It shall identify the initial
team or a team whose parent is the same as that of the current team."

While we are at it, we can simplify the wording by using the defined
term "team number".


Edit to 17-007r1:
---------------

[434:24-359] In 16.9.189, TEAM_NUMBER, para on Result Value, replace
"The result value is the team number that identifies the team of the
invoking image within the specified team."

by

"The result value is the {\ref team number} of the specified team."
