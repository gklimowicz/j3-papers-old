Discussion
----------

The coarray TS introduces statements that, when executed, have the
effect of causing a variable to be defined. Edits are needed in Clause
8 to incorporate these cases into 16.6.7 of the base standard.


Edits to N1967:
---------------

[30:17+] Add new subclause:

" 8.6a Edits to clause 16

{At the end of the list of variable definition contexts in 16.6.7p1,
replace the "." at the end of entry (15) with ";" and add a new entry
as follows}

(16) a <team-variable> in a FORM SUBTEAM statement;

(17) an <event-variable> in an EVENT POST or EVENT WAIT statement.
