Subject: Beginning a source line with a semicolon

Number:
Title: Beginning a source line with a semicolon
Submitted By: J3
Status: For consideration

Basic Functionality:

Remove the restriction against beginning a source line with a
semicolon.

Rationale:

This restriction is stated in 3.3.1.3 (for free source form)
and 3.3.2.4 (for fixed source form) of Fortran 2003.

This restriction was not in the original F90, but was added
by F90 corrigendum 3.  It remained in F95.

It is an unnecessary restriction:  removing it simplies the
standard.

Estimated Impact:

It is row #39 in spreadsheet 05-145.  It received a Hate-Love
vote of 0-0-13-2 and was judged an impact of 3 on the Reid scale.

Detailed Specification:

Remove the restriction against beginning a source line with a
semicolon as stated in section 3.3.1.3 (for free source form)
and 3.3.2.4 (for fixed source form) of Fortran 2003.

History:  Submitted as paper 04-282 at meeting 168 by Rich Maine.
