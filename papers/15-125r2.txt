Discussion
----------

In his recent ballot (see N2045) Reinhold Bader suggested some changes
in clause 8.7. The reasons are given with each edit.

Edits to N2040:
---------------

[37:14] Before "FORM TEAM", insert "\uwave{EVENT POST, EVENT WAIT,}".
Reason: Similar to locks, events only impose one-way segment ordering,
and this ordering is already defined in [18:21-24], so a SYNC MEMORY
appears unnecessary. See 09-193r2 for the reasoning for LOCK/UNLOCK.


[37:18+] Add a new edit

"{In 8.5.2 Segments, edit the first sentence of NOTE 8.34 as follows}
The model upon which the interpretation of a program is based is that
there is a permanent memory location for each coarray and that all
images \uwave{on which it is established} can access it."
Reason: The addition of teams renders the old wording incorrect.

[38:13] Replace "on all images" by "on the involved images".
Reason: For each statement it is clear on which images it is
executed; this may be a subset of all images.

[38:25] Replace "a END TEAM" by "an END TEAM".

[38:25] Replace "SYNC ALL, or SYNC MEMORY" by "or SYNC ALL".
Reason: SYNC MEMORY does not involve the "set of images in the current
team". It executes locally and involves completion of memory
operations to any image, possibly ones outside the current team.
