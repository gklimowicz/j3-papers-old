Subject: RANGE attribute and statement.

Paper 18-119 included a request for a RANGE attribute and statement

The feature would allow a programmer to restrict the array bounds
for an array without having to create a pointer with restricted
bounds.   More to the point, this means that the array does not
need to be declared as TARGET so that POINTER-remapping can be
used.  The TARGET attribute could have a performance impact.

Paper 18-119 also requested functions to inquire about the RANGE,
including being able to check the original bounds as well as the
RANGE values.

Data subgroup does not believe that the effort required for
this feature would be worth the value returned.  Also, performance
impact of TARGET is not as heinous as originally expected.
