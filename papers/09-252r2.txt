1. Introduction

UTI 166 suggests that "associating entity" was wrong for internal
procedures as actual arguments or procedure pointer targets, and that
"host instance" was likewise wrong; on closer examination it appears that
there was nothing wrong with "associating entity" but that "host instance"
was indeed wrong.  Edits are supplied to correct this.


2. Edits w.r.t. 09-007r2

[309:19-21 12.6.2.4p4]
  Replace "an internal procedure \obs{or statement function}"
  by "\obs{a statement function or} an internal procedure that is invoked
      by its name",
  replace "the internal subprogram \obs{or statement function}"
  by "the \obs{statement function or} internal subprogram".
{Insert necessary condition on internal procedures, swap ordering to keep
 the sentence readable.}

[309:21 12.6.2.4p4] Before "The host" insert
  "The host instance of an internal procedure that is invoked via a dummy
   procedure or procedure pointer is the host instance of the associating
   entity from when the argument association or pointer association was
   established (16.5.5)."
{Handle this case separately: careful wording because pointer association
 does not always happen via pointer assignment.}

[454:8+1:6] Delete UTI 166.
