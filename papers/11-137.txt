INTRODUCTION:

This paper collects (with one exception) the minor comments from
N1844 that are not already covered in other papers.
(The exception is a comment on section 5.2.7 para 1 which needs a
 separate paper since it may involve a technical change).

EDITS to N1838:

[3:16-17] On line 16, add "one of" before "the intrinsic"; on line 17,
          change "or" to "and".

[5:11] Change "the bounds" to "the rank and bounds".

[5:21+]   Reword NOTE 3.1 to

"Because the type and type parameters of an assumed-type dummy argument
are assumed from its effective argument, neither can be used for generic
resolution. Similarly, the rank of an assumed-rank dummy argument cannot
be used for generic resolution."

[9:30]    Add period at line end.

[11:1-3]  Replace the paragraph by
"If any actual argument is associated with a dummy argument that is an
assumed-size array, the array shall be simply contiguous, the member
attribute shall have the value CFI_attribute_unknown_size and the member
extent of the last dimension of member dim shall have the value -2."

[14:3]    Replace "for use in C functions" by "for invocation from C".

[14:7-8]  Replace "Pointer objects" by "A pointer object".

[15:12] Delete comma after "void *".

[15:39]   Add comma after "pointer".

[16:5-6]  Move the sentence "Since ..." to a note, since it is just
            explanation.  [Redundant if 11-123 is accepted.]

[16:14] Change "while the members of the descriptor are capable of
being referenced" to "while the descriptor represents the object".

[17:17-19] Delete 5.3 [The contents of 5.2.6.7 and 5.2.7 make this
        redundant.]

[20:4] Change "the shape" to "the rank, shape,".
