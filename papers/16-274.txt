1. Introduction
---------------

The requirements on actual arguments to elemental subroutines belong in
15.8.3.  It is unlikely anybody would find them in 15.5.4 without being
told to look there.  It is more likely they would be found in a
subclause entitled "Elemental subroutine actual arguments".

2. Edits
--------

[326:15-18 15.5.4p1] Delete "(15.8)".  Then move the final sentence of
15.5.4p1 ("If a reference...")  to the end of 15.8.3, appending it as a
new paragraph after [339:5+ 15.8.3p1+].

3. Optional alternative feature creep
-------------------------------------

The requirement in 15.5.4p1 that at least one array correspond to a
dummy argument with INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT) isn't necessary if the
subroutine is impure.

[xix Introduction under "Program units and procedures"] Insert an item
"It is not necessary for an array to correspond to at least one dummy
argument with INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT) in an elemental reference to
an impure elemental subroutine."

[326:15 15.5.4p1] Replace "an elemental" with "a pure elemental" before
moving it as described above.

[339:5+ 15.8.3p1+] Insert an additional paragraph after moving the last
sentence of 15.5.4p1 to [339:5+ 15.8.3p1+]:

"In an elemental reference to an impure elemental subroutine, every
actual argument that corresponds to a dummy argument with INTENT(OUT) or
INTENT(INOUT) shall be an array, and those arrays shall conform."
