There is a problem with assumed type that was hinted at in N1766 and was
discussed, but has been forgotten.  That is whether assumed type
arguments necessarily have an associated but hidden 'true type' and
whether it is required to be passed down a call chain.

I believe that the intent is that it is, that it isn't entirely obvious
to anyone concentrating on the C interface, and that it should be
clarified.

[11:0+] After table 5.2 add a new NOTE:

    "NOTE 5.0x
    The intent is that the type of an actual argument be passed down
    through all levels of a call chain, which is why there is no type
    code for an assumed type argument.  It is not intended that the
    type code for all assumed type actual arguments be CFI_type_cptr."
