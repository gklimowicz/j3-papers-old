OpenACC Liaison Report
======================
 
Information about OpenACC, including the current standard document,
training materials, and upcoming events can be found at
http://www.openacc.org/.
 
The current OpenACC standard is version 3.1. Version 3.1 of the OpenACC
specification was adopted November 2020.  The specification can be found
at https://www.openacc.org/specification. A notable feature of this
release is a definition for interactions with DO CONCURRENT when used
within OpenACC compute regions.
  
News
-----
Mentor, a Siemens business, has contracted with the Oak Ridge Leadership
Computing Facility (OLCF) to improve the implementation of OpenACC in
the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for NVIDIA and AMD processors.
 
Oak Ridge scientists are also working to implement OpenACC in the open
source LLVM Flang compiler (FLACC) and LLVM Clang compiler (CLACC).
 
NVIDIA has released its compiler for free in its HPC SDK, which includes
support for offloading DO CONCURRENT loops to a GPU with and without
OpenACC directives.
 
Applications
-------------
There are over 250 applications in production or development using
OpenACC, including:
	- Code LEO (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
	- NekCEM (Computational Electromagnetics)
	- INCOMP3d (3D incompressible Navier-Stokes solver)
	- Cloverleaf
	- MAESTRO and CASTRO (modeling stellar explosions)
	- LSDalton (quantum chemistry)
	- SPECFEM-X (Geophysics)
	- GTS (Fusion)
And the usual suspects:
	- Gaussian 16
	- ANSYS Fluent
	- VASP 6
	- MPAS-A
	- COSMO
	- GAMERA for GPU
	- Quantum Espresso
 
More information on these can be found on the OpenACC
web site at https://www.openacc.org/success-stories.
  
Hackathons
----------
In 2020 the OpenACC organization sponsored 18 hackathons, mostly
virtually, and have more events planned for 2021. Event dates are
posted at https://www.gpuhackathons.org/events. It is not a requirement
to use OpenACC directives to participate in these hackathons.
  
Community Engagement
--------------------
The OpenACC community slack is open to anyone interested and currently
supports a community of nearly 2700 members. The most recent users group
meeting, held virtually, had more than 300 attend live.
  
Upcoming Hackathons (22)
------------------------
Applications are still open for 19 of the 22 events.
