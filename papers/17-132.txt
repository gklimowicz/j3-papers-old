1. Introduction

This paper addresses a small number of miscellaneous typographical and
editorial errors.


2. Spacing anomaly discussion

We consistently inconsistently put a blank after the BNF "[" for
introducing optional syntax, and a following comma.  For intrinsic
procedure arguments, it is pretty consistently omitted.  For specifiers
in statements, it is inserted more often than not.

I think it looks better with a space for statement syntax, so edits
below are included to change some of these.  However, I am certainly
used to the way intrinsic procedures look, so these will be left alone.
The edits are not necessarily a comprehensive list of such anomalies, just
the ones I noticed.

NB: If instead we want to change "[ ," to "[,", changes will be needed to
    R401, R721, R722, R727, R737, R749, R751, R775, R801, R837, R840, ...
    (bored now).  Obviously this is going to be a significantly longer
    list than changing the other way, provided we exclude intrinsic
    argument lists from this.


3. Edits to 17-007

[throughout] Index appropriately "allocation status".

[69:15] 7.5.2.1 Syntax,
        Change heading to the more explicit
            "Syntax of a derived-type definition".
{Improve subclause title.}

[69:31] Same subclause, C732,
        Delete "(R727)",
        After "more than once in a" insert "given",
        making the whole constraint read
  "C732 The same <type-param-name> shall not appear more than once in a
        given <derived-type-stmt>."
{Repair statement of constraint.  Remove unnecessary BNF ref.}

[98:4] 8.2 Type declaration statement, R803 entity-decl,
       Change "[(" before "<array-spec>" to "[ (",
          and ")]" to ") ]".
{This is the only syntax rule missing a space between "[" and "(".}

[101:4] 8.5.5 BIND attribute for data entities, R808 language-binding-spec
        Change "[," before "NAME =" to "[ ,".
{Spacing anomaly.}

[140:19] 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement, R927 allocate-stmt,
         Change "[," before "<alloc-opt-list>" to "[ ,".
{Spacing anomaly.}

[169-170] 10.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, Table 10.8 Type
          conformance for the intrinsic assignment statement,
          Repair broken page-break, either by shortening the table
          title, artificially widening the table, or moving it so
          that the table does not cross a page boundary.
          E.g. "Intrinsic assignment type conformance".
{Wide caption with narrow table and a page break results in "(Cont.)"
 landing on top of the repeated caption on the next page.}

[187:8] 11.1.5.1 Purpose and form of the CHANGE TEAM construct,
        R1112 change-team-stmt,
        Between "<team-construct-name>" and ":" insert a space.
{We always have a space between a construct-name and the colon.
 Except here.}

[187:9] Same subclause, same rule,
        Change "[," to "[ ," twice,
        once before "<coarray-association-list>",
        once before "<sync-stat-list>".
{Spacing anomaly.}

[190:21] 11.1.7.2 Form of the DO construct, R1123 loop-control,
         Change "[," before "<scalar-int-expr>" to "[ ,".
{Spacing anomaly.}

[206:30,31] 11.4 STOP and ERROR STOP statements, R1160 stop-stmt and
            R1161 error-stop-stmt,
            Change "[," before "QUIET =" to "[ ,".
{Spacing anomaly.}

[213:2] 11.6.6 SYNC TEAM, R1168 sync-team-stmt,
        Change "[," before "<sync-stat-list>" to "[ ,".
{Spacing anomaly.}

[213:28] 11.6.8 EVENT WAIT statement, C1176,
         Delete "(R1172)" and change "in an" to "in a given",
         making that whole constraint read
  "C1176 No specifier shall appear more than once in a given
         <event-wait-spec-list>."
{Our normal wording.  No syntax rule annotation is needed.}

[214:16] 11.6.9 FORM TEAM statement, R1175 form-team-stmt,
         Change "[," before "<sync-stat-list>" to "[ ,".
{Spacing anomaly.}

[239:27] 12.6.3 Data transfer input/output list, p7, first bullet,
         After "nor may any array element appear more than once"
         change "in an" to "in a given",
         making that whole bullet item read
  "- If an array appears as an input/output list item, it is treated as if
     the elements, if any, were specified in array element order
     (9.5.3.2). However, no element of that array may affect the value of
     any expression in the input-item, nor may any element appear more
     than once in a given input-item."
{I believe this is what is intended - i.e. it is talking about vector
 subscripts, not multiple appearances of an array in an input list.}.

[335:35] 15.6.4 Statement function, C1580,
         After "more than once in" change "any" to "a given",
         making the whole constraint read
  "C1580 (R1544) A given <dummy-arg-name> shall not appear more than once
         in a given <dummy-arg-name-list>.
{Another "more than once" fix.  I've left the syntax rule in because there
 appears to be no such constraint on other occurrences of
 dummy-arg-name-list (requirements, but not, I think, constraints).}

[342:33+-343:1-] 16.3.1 General (in 16.3 Bit model),
                 enable proper line numbering in p2.

[344:0-1-,2-3] 16.4 Numeric models,
               enable proper line numbering in p2 and p3.

[357:16] 16.9.13 ANY, p3 Arguments, MASK argument,
         Change "shall a logical" to "shall be a logical".
{Fix typo.}

[Index] Create an index entry "association status"
        which simply points to "pointer association status".
