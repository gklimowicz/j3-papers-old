To: J3
From: Van Snyder and Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Editor's report on 07-007r1, part 1
Date: 2007 March 28

1. Introduction

This is the report arising from entering the papers passed at meeting 179.

2. Infrastructure - j3.cls

Added an "intrinargs" list environment to set intrinsic procedure
arguments, so that they get line numbers.  Changed the "intrinarg" command
to create such a list with one item.  Left the old definitions as comments.

Added an "argcase" list environment for setting cases within intrinsic
procedure argument descriptions.  The case is indented by IIplus, and the
case width is the same as Ial + IIplus.  The result is that it is indented
by IIplus compared to the argument description.  This is different from the
"incase" environment, which is used for setting cases in the "description"
or "examples" parts of intrinsic procedure descriptions. (I think I ended
up not using this anywhere.)

Changed the indentation margins for lists of arguments, and cases of
various things, in Clause 13, to be the same as for the subclause headings
(0.75in).  Clause 13 looks a little bit better with these margins aligned,
and the standard is two pages shorter.

3. Miscellaneous changes

Noticed that the enum after C552 in Annex E is not in Clause 5.
Repaired that by removing the enum (which was obsolete) from Annex E.

Did some work on the index.
Removed type specifier keywords from the index as primary index items.
Entered them instead as ``type specifier, INTEGER,'' etc.

Changed the list style in the intro from enum to itemize.

Turned on line numbers in Annex E.

Examined all instances of "present" and "absent" and repaired the ones
that were incorrect.

4. Meeting Papers

07-103r2

  Second paragraph of BACK replaced by
    "If more than one image has a value that matches VALUE, and BACK is
     absent or present with the value false, the smallest such image index
     is assigned to RESULT. If BACK is present with the value true, the
     image whose index is assigned to RESULT is the largest such image
     index."
  This replacement assigns a value ``to RESULT'' instead of just assigning
  a value somewhere.

  Corrected the first example by replacing "CALL CO_FINDLOC (CO_ARRAY, 6)"
  by "CALL CO_FINDLOC (CO_ARRAY, 6, RESULT)"

  Modified the second example to make it more illuminating.

07-121r1

  As passed.

07-122

  As passed.

07-127r1

  523:20-23 Inserted (13.7.154) (not 13.7.54) after SELECTED_REAL_KIND.
  544:38 use "is assigned" instead of "will contain"
  554:4 didn't do this,  since the previous edit deleted text that would be
        edited.

07-143r1

  As passed.

07-144r2

  Inserted ``the blank padding character...'' after ``the kind of a
  character length type parameter'', not after ``the value assigned to the
  <errmsg-variable>'', and combined the one for formatted output with it.

  Inserted UTI 110.

  In ``which value is chosen...'' used (10.7.2.3.7) instead of (10.7.2.4).
  Replaced "as described in ..." by "(...)" four times in the annex, for
  consistency.

  As passed.  Deleted UTI 107.

07-148r2

  Deleted UTIs 073 and 090.

07-149r1

  As passed, but I was tempted to make "the maximum number of images" a
  separate list item.

  Deleted UTI 099.

07-150r2

  Added cross references in Clause 6 for "ultimate argument" since that's
  in Clause 12, and indexed "ultimate argument".

07-151

  As passed.  Deleted UTI 104.

07-152r1

  127:2+ Reworded C640a to say that the <type-spec> shall not specify C_PTR
         or C_FUNPTR, to cover the case of renaming during use association.
  164:28+ added it as a clause instead of a sentence so the existing
          "Otherwise" makes sense.
  Deleted UTI 089.

07-154r1

  As passed.

07-155r2

  Added stuff about stop code from ALL STOP statement to Annex D. 256:25-26
  Used STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE instead of SYNC_STOPPED_IMAGE since the latter
  isn't defined anywhere.

07-157r2

  As passed.  Deleted UTI 081.

07-158

  As passed (nothing to do).

07-159

  As passed.

07-160

  As passed.

07-161r1

  Nothing done.  It suggested to remove UTI 102, but that was not done,
  since in its emasculated state (C_PTR and C_FUNPTR do not have pointer
  components), 07-161r1 does not address the subject of UTI 102.

07-162r2

  As passed.

07-163r1

  Added a cross reference to the subclause heading for Annex C.

07-164r1

  As passed.

07-168r1

  As passed.

07-169

  As passed.

07-170

  Used "the unit" instead of "this unit" for consistency with the rest of
  the list.

07-171

  As passed with "parenthesis" replaced by "parentheses".  Deleted UTI
  097 because we passed 07-172, a related interp that has the same edits.

07-173 (Straight from Mike to /edit)

  Caused me to reorder some subclauses in Annex C to put them into order
  according to the normative subclauses to which they apply.
  Used 4.5.7 instead of 4.1 for abstract types.
  Added paragraphs about vector and matrix two-norms.
  pdflatex refused to work with cross references on "Module for THIS_IMAGE
  and IMAGE_INDEX" in Annex C.
