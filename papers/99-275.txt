TITLE:  Usage of BOZ literal constants

DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress
QUESTION:

Consider:
  INTEGER X(10)
  DATA X(B"001")/42/
  END

This is apparently conforming, since the constraint at [32:15] says
  "A <boz-literal-constant> may appear only in a DATA statement."
But this rules out
  X(B"001") = 42

Is this an error?

ANSWER 1:

Yes, BOZ literal constants should be allowed anywhere an integer literal
is allowed.

ANSWER 2:

Yes, BOZ literal constants should be restricted to being a
<data-stmt-constant>.

EDITS 1:

[32:10-11] Delete.

[32:15] Delete.

[35:14+] Add the semantics for BOZ constants from the DATA statement, viz
  "A <boz-literal-constant> is treated as if the constant were an
   <int-literal-constant> with a <kind-param> that specifies the representation
   method with the largest decimal exponent range supported by the processor."

[63:3-6] Delete the old semantics from the DATA statement.

EDITS 2:

[32:15] Replace text of constraint with
  "A <boz-literal-constant> may appear only as the <data-stmt-constant> in a
   DATA statement."
