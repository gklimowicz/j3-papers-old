Subject:        Issue #94: global variables and name mangling

Issue 94 says that we need to mention C global variables
and name mangling. C global variables are now addressed
in section 6.2.7. Name mangling still needs to be addressed
as part of issue 232.

Edits:

"Name mangling still needs to be addressed. See Issue 232."
