Overview
========

While working on issue 323, /data discovered a number of errors
and infelicities on the draft related to the word "keyword".
This document attempts to repair some of them:
o  Simplify 2.5.2 by grouping three of the meanings together.
o  Fix BNF error related to <keyword>.
o  Fix font typo in BNF.
o  Fix a small number of inconsistent uses of the word keyword.
o  Change "component name keyword" to simply "component keyword"
   to be more consistent in terminology.
o  Delete unhelpful glossary entries.

Edits

[19:2-25] Replace the text of 2.5.2:
{Note to Richard: some of this text comes from the existing
2.5.2; it is re-entered here to better allow J3 to see the effects
of some fairly extensive edits.}
"The term <<keyword>> is used in two ways in this standard.

  (1) It is used to describe a word that is part of the syntax
      of a statement.  These keywords are not reserved words; that
      is, names with the same spellings are allowed.  In the
      syntax rules, such keywords appear literally.  In descriptive
      text, this meaning is denoted by the term <<statement
      keyword>> and by the use of the term keyword without any
      preceding modifier.  Examples of statement keywords are:
      IF, READ, UNIT, KIND, and INTEGER.

  (2) It is used to denote names that identify items in a list.
      In argument lists, type parameter lists, and structure
      constructors, items may be identified by a preceding
      <keyword>= rather their position within the list.  An
      <<argument keyword>> is the name of a dummy argument in the
      interface for the procedure being referenced, a <<type
      parameter keyword>> is the name of a type parameter in the
      type being specified, and a <<component keyword>> is the
      name of a component in a structure constructor.

R2XX <keyword> <<is>> <name>

NOTE 2.6

Use of keywords rather than position to identify items in a list
can make such lists more readable and allows them to be reordered.
This facilitates specification of a list in cases where optional
items are omitted."
