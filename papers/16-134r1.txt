Subject:    Comments on DATE_AND_TIME
Reference:  16-007
Date: 2016 February 10

The specification of the values for date, time, and time zone in the
description of the intrinsic subroutine DATE_AND_TIME (356, 13.8.54p3)
should prohibit zero suppression.  The formats specified in
ISO 8601:2004 do not allow embedded blanks.

The specification of the year has the form CCYY, where CC is the
century and YY is the year in the century.  The form is unnecessarily
complicated and subject to ambiguity (which century is it?).
ISO 8601:2004 specifies that the form of years is YYYY.  That form
avoids ambiguity.

Edits are provided to address these issues.
