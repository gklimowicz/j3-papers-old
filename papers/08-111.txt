Discussion:

Note 9.23 at the end of 9.5.6 Open, was not updated to reflect the
change to the treatment of preconnected units introduced in
07-008. Except in the three noted cases, bu default preconnected units
are now local to each image, and are no longer restricted as indicated
in the note. Edits are provided to correct this.


Edits to 08-007:

[228:13+] In Note 9.23 at the end of 9.5.6 OPEN statement, replace the
second sentence with

"If the number of images is greater than one, file positioning
statements and READ are not allowed for the preconnected units
identified by the values OUTPUT_UNIT and ERROR_UNIT."
