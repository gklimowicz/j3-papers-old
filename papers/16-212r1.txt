We accept the editor's recommendations, including changing "coselector" to
"selector".


Edits to J3/16-007r1
--------------------

[3:6-7] In 1.3.6 associate name, after "ASSOCIATE," add "CHANGE TEAM,"
and delete ", or associated ... CHANGE TEAM construct".

[3:21-22] In 1.3.8.2 construct association, after "ASSOCIATE," add
"CHANGE TEAM," and delete ", or between ... CHANGE TEAM construct".

[175:2] In 8.1.3.3 Other attributes of associate names, para 1, line 1,
after "ASSOCIATE" add ", CHANGE TEAM,".

[175:11] In 8.1.3.3 Other attributes of associate names, after
         "as those of the selector.", end the paragraph;
         insert a new paragraph:
  "Within a CHANGE TEAM construct, the associating entity is a coarray.
   Its corank and cobounds are as specified in its <codimension-decl>.".
         begin a new paragraph, changing
            "If the associating"
         to
            "Within an ASSOCIATE, CHANGE TEAM, SELECT RANK, or SELECT
             TYPE construct, if the associating".

[177:1+] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, at the start, add subclause
title "8.1.5.1 Purpose and form of the CHANGE TEAM construct".

[177:2] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, paragraph 1, append
  "Names can be associated with coarrays in the scoping unit in the same
   way as for the ASSOCIATE construct (\ref{D16:Statement and construct
   entities} 16.4, \ref{D16:Construct association} 16.5.1.6).  Each
   <coarray-name> in a <codimension-decl> in the CHANGE TEAM statement
   is an associate name which is associated with the corresponding
   selector.  The associating coarray assumes the type and type parameters
   of the selector; it is polymorphic if and only if the selector is
   polymorphic.  The other attributes of the associating entity are
   described in \ref{D8:Other attributes of associate names}8.1.3.3.".
{This works after the changes in 8.1.3.3 above.}

[177:8,19,22,23] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, para 1, third BNF rule,
fifth constraint, and final two constraints, change "coselector-name"
to "selector-name".

[177:23+] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, after para 1, add subclause
title "8.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct".

[178:1-5] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, replace para 3 by

"Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct causes evaluation of the
expressions within each <codimension-decl> in the CHANGE TEAM statement,
followed by execution of its block.  The associating coarray shall be
established when the CHANGE TEAM statement begins execution.

It is permissible to branch to an <end-change-team-stmt> only from within
its CHANGE TEAM construct."

[178:5+] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, para 3, maybe delete UTI 19.

[507:9] In 16.4 Statement and construct entities, para 10, change
"8.1.5" to "8.1.5.1".

[510:9] In 16.5.1.6 Construct association, para 1, final sentence, change
"coselector" to "selector".

[522:36] In 16.6.7 Variable definition context, para 1, item(12), change
"coselector" to "selector".
