Subject: Issue 276 (Identifier)                       J3/01-185r1
From: Kurt W. Hirchert                  (Meeting 156) 23 Mar 2001 

========
Overview
========

Issue 276 points out a particular place where the use of the
word "identifier" was subject to possible misinterpretation.
This paper attempts to clarify that particular situation, to
insert a warning to the reader that "identifier" means different
things in different places, and to fix other infelicities
discovered along the way.

[23:11+] Add the following as a note:
"The word name always denotes this specific syntactic form.
The word identifier is used when entities may be identified
by other syntactic forms or by values; its specific meaning
depends on the context in which it is used." { The warning }

[235:36] Add "The entities made accessible are identified by the
names or generic identifiers used to identify them in the module.
By default, they are identified by the same identifiers in the
scoping unit containing the USE statement, but it is possible to
specify that different local identifiers be used." { This is the
text intended to resolve issue 276. }

[236:27-31] Delete the J3 note.

[341:13+] Insert unresolved issue note:
"This list is known to be seriously incomplete.  At a minimum,
it is known to be missing dtio generic identifiers and data
transfer operation identifiers (9.5.1.8).  This also means that
the scope of these new items must be properly stated in the
subsequent subsections of 14 and that they should be in the
glossary."  { The systematic search for other "identifiers" seemed
to much to get right this late in the meeting, so we leave a
reminder to do it for next meeting. }
