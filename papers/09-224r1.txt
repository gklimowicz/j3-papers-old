Subject: Allow return back to a block
Date: 2009 May 06

Paper 09-176r1 remarks that, due to definitions
of "transfer of control" and the prohibition
on transfers of control into a block, technically,
a program cannot return to a block
from a subprogram referenced within a block.
The repair proposed in 09-176
involves changing the definition of branch,
and tracing the results of that change throughout
the standard.

Subgroup is reluctant to make so sweeping a change
at this date in the revision cycle, so a more modest
change is proposed to repair the defect.

Edits:

[171:20 8.1.2.1p1] -----------------------------------------------------

Editor: Replace "Transfer of control" by "Branching (8.2)" because
"transfer of control" prohibits procedures from returning.  Alternate
returns are branches, so "Branching" covers that case correctly.  8.2.1
explicitly says that there are transfers of control that are not
branches.  The two other occurrences of "transfers" in this paragraph
are correct.

[176:42 8.1.6.4p2] -----------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "transfer of control" by "branching (8.2)" because
"transfer of control" prohibits procedures from returning.  Index this
occurrence of "branch" (this occurrence of "transfer of control" is not
currently indexed).

[178:20-23 8.1.6.6.3p5]-------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the first "transfer of control" by "branch (8.2)" the
second by "branching" or "a branch", and the third by "branch".  Index
these occurrences of "branch" (these occurrences of "transfer of
control" are not currently indexed).

[188:3-4 8.2.1p1] ------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the first two sentences ("Branching ... same scoping
unit") to use the definition of execution sequence in 2.3.5:

"A <<Branch>> alters the normal execution sequence (2.3.5).  When a
branch occurs, the next statement executed is the branch target
statement, in the same scoping unit, that is labeled by the label in the
branch, instead of the one that would be executed by continuing the
normal execution sequence."

[188:7 8.2.1p1] --------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "cause transfer of control" by "change the normal
execution sequence".

[188:16-17 8.2.2p1] ----------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the paragraph by:

"Execution of a <<GO TO statement>> causes a branch to the branch target
statement identified by the label."

[313:29-30 12.6.2.7p1] -------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "transfers control to the" by "branches (8.2) to the
branch target".  Replace "transfer of control" by "branch".  Index these
appearances of "branch".
