Subject: Files connected to more than one unit

Discussion:

Output on the units OUTPUT_UNIT or ERROR_UNIT on every image are
normally expected to display on the same device (such as a terminal
screen) or be redirected to the same physical file.  Whole records
from the images are to be interleaved into one stream of text, to
enhance readability.

In 09-007 there is a contradiction in that OUTPUT_UNIT is connected to
the same file for all images ([206:22-23]) with a similar rule for
ERROR_UNIT ([206:26]), and that more than one unit cannot be connected
to the same file ([207:26-27]).

One resolution of the contradiction is to change the text so that
OUTPUT_UNIT and ERROR_UNIT are exceptions to the rule that multiple
units (one from each image) cannot be connected to a single file.
This option is consistent with the design of parallel I/O that was
originally proposed and later removed for future reconsideration.  It
also matches what actually happens in some implementations. Edits for
this option are in 09-119r1.

Another option is to have separate files, one pair for each image, and
add a Note that the processor is expected to do the right thing with
these files, effectively as a postprocessing step. This option
maintains the current (f03) standard design while still allowing
implementations to continue doing what already happens with output from
MPI and OpenMP programs. Edits for this option are provided in this
paper.


Edits to 09-007:

[206:22-23] In 9.5.1 Referring to a file, para 4, sentence 3, delete
"to the same file on all images".

[206:26] In 9.5.1 Referring to a file, para 5, sentence 2, delete
"to the same file on all images".

[206:28+] At the end of 9.5.1 Referring to a file, add a new Note:

"Note 9.14a 
Even though OUTPUT_UNIT is connected to a separate file on each image,
it is expected that the processor can merge the sequences of records
from these files into a single sequence of records that is sent to the
physical device associated with this unit, such as the user's
terminal. If ERROR_UNIT is associated with the same physical device,
the sequences of records from files connected to ERROR_UNIT on each of
the images could be merged into the same sequence generated from the
OUTPUT_UNIT unit files. Otherwise, it is expected that the sequence of
records in the files connected to ERROR_UNIT on each image could be
merged into a single sequence of records that is sent to the physical
device associated with ERROR_UNIT."
