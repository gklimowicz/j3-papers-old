NUMBER: F03/0074
TITLE: Type mismatch for C character arguments
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, dummy procedures
DEFECT TYPE: ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following conforming if the C character kind (C_CHAR) is not
the same as the default character kind (KIND('A'))?

use iso_c_binding
Interface
   Subroutine sub(string) Bind(C)
      import C_Char
      Character(Kind=C_Char) :: string(*)
   End Subroutine
End Interface

Character(Kind=C_Char,Len=10) :: string
Call sub(string)

The second and 3rd paras of 12.4.1.2 do not treat C character kind the
same as default character kind, and seem to require matching type
parameter values between the actual and dummy. This makes Note 15.23
nonconforming if C_CHAR is not the same as default character kind, and
is also not in sync with 270:25-26.

ANSWER:

Yes, the program fragment is standard-conforming.  An edit is provided
to correct the oversight in 12.4.1.2.

EDITS:

[269:3,5,8] After each "of type default character",
  Insert "or of type character with the C character kind (15.1)",
  Thrice.
