Here is a draft response for F03/0031, with thanks to Malcolm Cohen
for his help.

NUMBER:  F03/0031
TITLE:  IEEE invalid
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, invalid exception
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

What exceptions (if any) are raised by the following:
 infinity + (-infinity)
 infinity - infinity
 0.0 * infinity
 infinity / infinity
 0.0 / 0.0

Fortran 2003 is silent on these expressions.  
IEEE-754 defines (in 7.1) those as invalid.

ANSWER:

The Fortran Standard and Technical Report ISO/IEC TR 15580 were 
written to supplement the IEEE International Standard and to allow
for systems that do not fully support it. That the IEEE International
Standard is a normative reference is made clear in 1.9. 

The questions related to infinity are answered by the third paragraph
of 14.8, which states

"The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_INF is provided to inquire whether 
the processor supports IEEE infinities. Where these are supported, 
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic 
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard."

The expression 0.0 / 0.0 is defined as invalid by the IEEE
International Standard and therefore causes the exception 
IEEE_INVALID to occur. 

EDITS: None.
