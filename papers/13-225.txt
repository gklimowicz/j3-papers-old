Subject: Characters in formatted records
Date: 2013 December 29

The deficiency:

The character set is processor-dependent.  Thus, presumably,
so is the division of characters into control characters and
graphic characters.  The processor must allow any graphic
character to be printed in a formatted record, but is allowed
to forbid a set of control characters from appearing
in a formatted record.  However, which control characters
are so forbidden cannot be detected by a program (at least,
not without non-obvious, and possibly processor-dependent tricks).
With ever-larger character sets supported by processors,
diagnosis of "character format-ability" would be helpful
to diligent programmers.

The proposal:

Give the programmer the ability to detect whether a character
may be included in a formatted record.  This might be
something as simple as is_formatable() to return a s-d-l value
when given a character of any kind supported by the processor.

With such a diagnostic intrinsic, the programmer could choose
the appropriate action when device-control-2 is not allowed
in a formatted record, for example, substituting a blank.
