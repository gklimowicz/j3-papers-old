1. Editorial stuff with edits
-----------------------------

[4.3 51:1+] Introduce a subclause number 4.3.1, with a name such as
"General", to satisfy ISO structural rules.

[4.6p4 83:3] Replace "result" with "value" (expressions don't have
results).

[7.1.2.3 134:4-5] Replace R703 by
R703  <defined-unary-op>  <<is>> <defined-op>
R703a <defined-op>        <<is>> . letter [ letter ] ... .

[7.1.2.3 134:6]
Within C703 replace "<defined-unary-op>" by "<defined-op>"

[7.1.2.8 136:17] Replace R723 by
R723  <defined-binary-op> <<is>> <defined-op>

[7.1.2.8 136:18-19] Delete C704.

[8.1.6.2 174:28] C607 says "<int-variable> shall be of type integer."
The <scalar-> prefix and <-name> suffix in <scalar-int-variable-name>
in R819 are assumed syntax rules.  Concerning assumed syntax rules,
1.4.3p1 [22:14-15] says "... and convey appropriate constraint
information...."  Therefore C607 applies to R819.  Therefore C812 is
redundant with C607.  Delete C812.

[10.11.3.2p4 267:28-29] A discussion of namelist comments ought to be in
subclause 10.11.3.6 Namelist comments.  The essence of 10.11.3.2p4,
except for the part about namelist comments not being allowed after the
slash that terminates execution of the input statement, is already in
that subclause.  Since a slash terminates execution of the input
statement, it seems the processor doesn't care what's after the slash,
so why are comments prohibited?  This might have had something to do
with namelist stream input, but 10.11.3.6 prohibits comments in namelist
stream input.  Delete 10.11.3.2p4.

[A.2 461:50+] Since namelist output is only required to be consistent
with namelist input, and component names are optional in input, it is
processor dependent whether component names appear in namelist output.
[461:50] specifies that "the results of namelist output" are processor
dependent.  It is not obvious that this applies to more than the
organization of output items into records, and the format used for
numeric items.  Since whether component names appear in namelist output
is not mentioned in 10.11.4, it should be mentioned here.  Add a list
item
  "o whether structure component names appear in namelist output
     (10.11.4);"

R703  <defined-unary-op>  <<is>> <defined-op>
R703a <defined-op>        <<is>> . letter [ letter ] ... .

C703 (R703a) A <defined-op> shall not contain...,

R722 were defined as

R722  <defined-binary-op> <<is>> <defined-op>

and C704 were deleted.

This might in any case be a desirable editorial change, since it
eliminates one constraint (at the expense of adding a syntax rule).

2. Questions without edits
--------------------------

There are several places where "for example" appears embedded in
normative text:

  1.4.4p3, 1.4.4p4, 3.3.2.2p1, 5.5p2, 9.2.1p1 9.3.3.3p2--200:4
  9.3.3.4p3--200:20, 9.4p2--203:20, 10.7.2.3.7p2, 13.7.44p3--341:7,
  13.7.70p5--352:18, 13.7.136p5--380:28--380:33, 14.3p5, 14.3p6, 14.3p7.

Are any of these normative?  Should at least some be in notes (or maybe
deleted)?  I have a dim, perhaps incorrect, recollection that in some
standard we specified that nonnormative material appeared in boxes and
with shaded background (or some such description), but I can't find it
in 10-007r1.  Do we still say it?  Should we?  Should the "Example"
paragraphs of the descriptions of intrinsic procedures and procedures in
intrinsic modules be specified to be nonnormative?

[9.8.3p3 232:19-20] After a discussion of the effect of executing an
ENDFILE statement for a stream access file, the last sentence of the
paragraph says "Subsequent stream output statements may be used to write
further data to the file."

Does this mean before the terminal position of the file?  Does it change
the terminal position of the file if data are written after the
previously-established terminal position?  Can we handle this without an
interp?
