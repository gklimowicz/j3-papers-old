Subject: Editor's list of unresolved technical issues
Date: 2020-December-18


A. Introduction
---------------

This document lists the technical issues raised by the editor with the
current working document, standing document 007.

Issues are separated into two lists; the resolved ones and the unresolved
ones.  When an issue is resolved, the J3 note in SD-007 will be deleted and
the item moved from the unresolved list to the resolved list.  Issue
numbers will not be reused.

The one-line description is just a hint as to the issue, not a
comprehensive statement of it.

The editor notes that all Unresolved Technical Issues are indexed in the
working draft 007, as ZZZUTInnn. Thus you can find them quickly by going
to the last page and clicking on the index reference.
