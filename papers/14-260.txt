----------

Several constants are defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module as
specified at the end of Clause 13.  Included are ones beginning STAT_.
Where the names for these constants are included in text far from
place where they are described in Clause 13, there should be a
reference.

This paper inserts such references in the TS descriptions of the
intrinsic functions FAILED_IMAGES and STOPPED_IMAGES.

Edits to N2027:
---------------

ISO_FORTRAN_ENV".
{Add citation in FAILED_IMAGES description.}


[27:22] After "STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE" insert "from the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV".
{Add citation in STOPPED_IMAGES description.}
