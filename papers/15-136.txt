NUMBER: F08/0132
TITLE: Can a procedure pointer be declared with an interface block?
KEYWORDS: procedure pointer, interface block
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the program

  PROGRAM c11
    INTERFACE
      REAL FUNCTION F()
      END FUNCTION
    END INTERFACE
    POINTER F
    EXTERNAL G
    F => G
    PRINT *,F()
  END PROGRAM
  REAL FUNCTION G()
    G = 206
  END FUNCTION

According to 12.4.3.2 paragraph 5, F is an external procedure (and
seems to be missing).  There is no mention of the possibility of a
procedure pointer in the subclause on interface blocks.

Is this intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, this is intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to correct the mistake in 12.4.3.2.

EDITS:

[281:26] In 12.4.3.2 Interface block, paragraph 5,
  After "specific interface for an external procedure"
  change "or a dummy procedure"
  to     ", dummy procedure, or procedure pointer".
{Add procedure pointer for the list of things this can declare.}

[281:27-28] Same paragraph,
  After "interface body, the procedure is a dummy procedure"
  change "; otherwise"
  to ".  If the procedure has the POINTER attribute, it is a
      procedure pointer.  If it is not a dummy procedure and is
      not a procedure pointer,".
{Correct how we establish what it is.}

This makes that whole paragraph read:

  An interface body in a generic or specific interface block specifies
  the EXTERNAL attribute and an explicit specific interface for an
  external procedure, dummy procedure, or procedure pointer.  If the
  name of the declared procedure is that of a dummy argument in the
  subprogram containing the interface body, the procedure is a dummy
  procedure.  If the procedure has the POINTER attribute, it is a
  procedure pointer.  If it is not a dummy procedure and is not a
  procedure pointer, it is an external procedure.

{Note careful wording to avoid saying that a dummy procedure is not a
 procedure pointer, since a dummy procedure pointer is indeed both a
 dummy procedure and a procedure pointer.}
