----------

Replacing "whole coarray" by "coarray" is correct here. Putting in an
image selector is explicitly disallowed for each subroutine. What is
allowed is for the argument to be a non-coarray, e.g. a local object
declared without square brackets. In this case, the collective will
need to use its own coarray for its intermediate working (or the
equivalent of this) copying data into it soon after entry and back
out of it before return.

In the middle of para. 2 of 13.6, we find the wording "between
executions of CHANGE TEAM and END TEAM statements" unsatisfactory
because it needs to include "between two executions of CHANGE TEAM
statements" and "between two executions of END TEAM statements".
An edit is suggested.


Edit to J3/16-007r1
-------------------

[337:17] In 13.6 Collective subroutines, middle of para 2, replace
"between executions of CHANGE TEAM and END TEAM statements" by
"between an execution of a CHANGE TEAM or END TEAM statement and
another execution of a CHANGE TEAM or END TEAM statement".

[337:24+] In 13.6 Collective subroutines, para 3, delete UTI 26.
