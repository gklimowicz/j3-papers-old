Subject: Renumber 13.8.2

Section 13.8.2 describes the constants contained
in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  Several
proposals suggest adding new named constants
and procedures to ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

It makes sense to renumber the subsections
in order to give the procedures a separate sequence
from the constants.

This is a separate paper from any proposed addition
to ISO_FORTRAN_ENV in order to separate the issues
of proposed additions from renumbering.
