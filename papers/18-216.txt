1. Introduction

In the Contents:

Please remove the clauses in Annexes.
ISO only keeps the Annex titles in the Table of contents.


2. Response

Accepted.


3. Edits to N2146

Add and use new LaTeX macros for subclauses in Annexes.

Perhaps something line

\newcommand\NoContentsLine[3]{}
\newcommand\asection[1]{%
\bgroup\let\addcontentsline=\NoContentsLine%
\section{#1}%
\egroup}
\newcommand\asubsection[1]{%
\bgroup\let\addcontentsline=\NoContentsLine%
\subsection{#1}%
\egroup}

Or alternatively, rename our current \section and \subsection to be
\jsection and \jsubsection, with \section and \subsection defined to
just call those, then at the beginning of the annexes use \renewcommand
to redefine \section and \subsection as the nocontents versions.
