Title:  New intrinsics to determine current scope

Basic Functionality:
--------------------

Provide instrinsic routines which return information about
the current lexical scope.

Rationale:
----------

Logging and reporting of exceptional events can be significantly
enhanced by providing means to determine the location of the event
within the source code.  Such intrinsics strongly compliment
traditional ASSERT capabilities and enable development of
general error handling utilities.  Some of these intrinsics may also
be of value in certain processes requiring registration (ala software
frameworks).

Example:

        ASSERT(...,msg=my_msg(PROCEDURE_NAME()),...)

Estimated Impact:
-----------------

Small impact for the standard and probably small impact for the compiler
vendors.  Might get tricky if a consensus on some arbitrary details cannot
be arrived at.

Detailed Specification:
-----------------------

Provide the following new intrinsic procedures:

        * LINE_NUMBER()
        * SOURCE_NAME()
        * PROCEDURE_NAME()
        * MODULE_NAME()

LINE_NUMBER() returns the line number within the source file at which the
invoking statement begins.

SOURCE_NAME() returns the name of the source file in which the intrisic
has been invoked.  If the file is from standard input, the result
should be " " (or "STDIN"?).    Result is compiler dependent.


PROCEDURE_NAME() will return the qualified name of the procedure
within which the intrinsic is invoked.  For internal procedures, the
result should consist of both the concatenation of the hosting
procedure and the internal procedure names.

Results are:
         <main-program-name>[:<internal_subprogram>]   or
         <external-subprogram>[:<internal_subprogram>] or
         <module-subprogram>[:<internal_subprogram>]

MODULE_NAME() will return the name, of the module in which the
intrinsic is invoked or an empty string if not within any module.

Results are:
         " "           or
         <module-name> or
         <parent-identifier>:<submodule-name>
