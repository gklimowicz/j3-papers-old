Subject: Edits for UK comment TC3 (Default DT parameter initialization)
Date: 31 March 2003
Author: Lawrie Schonfelder

Comment TC3 of the UK vote was:

    Allow default initialization of parameter values of derived types.

    This is an editorially easy change to make and will lead to
    consistency with the properties of intrinsic types.


Here are the edits for this: w.r.t. 03-166

41:11-13. Replace ". There ... entity." by "and may have a default value."

45:3. Change "<name>" to "<decl>".

45:3+. Add 
   <type-param-decl> <<is>> <type-param-name>  #
                            # [ = <scalar-int-initialization-expr> ]

45:14+. Add paragraph:
    If a <type-param-decl> has a <scalar-int-initialization-expr>, the
    type parameter has a default value that is specified by the
    expression. If necessary, the value is converted according to the
    rules of intrinsic assignment (7.4.1.3) to a value of the same kind
    as the type parameter.

45:17+ NOTE 4.25+3. Replace line by
       INTEGER, KIND :: k = kind(0.0)

58:24. Delete "if and".

58:25. At the end of the sentence, add
  "that does not have a default value, and at most one <type-param-spec>
   corresponding to each parameter of the type that has a default value".

57:34+. Add paragraph:
    The value of a type parameter for which no <type-param-value> has
    been specified is its default value.
