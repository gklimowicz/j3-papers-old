KEYWORDS: subroutine, generic, implicit

STATUS: Submitted

QUESTION:

 Q1. Is the following generic allowed?
 
     interface q
       subroutine qr(f)
         implicit real(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
       subroutine qc(f)
         implicit complex(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
     end interface q

     The uncertainly arises because it is not established
     whether F is a subroutine or a function. If either F
     were a subroutine, then it would be clear that the
     generic was disallowed. One might be able to use this
     to deduce that both Fs must be functions. This seems
     like an obscure deduction to demand of the compiler.

 Q2. Consider the following "obviously" allowed generic
 
     module m
       interface q
         subroutine qr(f)
           real, external :: f
         end subroutine
         subroutine qc(f)
           complex, external :: f
         end subroutine
       end interface q
     end module m

     Is the following main program valid?
    
     program main
       use m
       external ff
       call q(ff)
     end
     
     Again, the problem is that it is unclear whether of not
     ff is a function or subroutine. If it is a subroutine,
     then the call is ambiguous. One might thus deduce that
     ff must be a function, and therefore of type real,
     but this seems like an obscure deduction to demand of
     the compiler.

ANSWER:

 I'm not sure. But presumably either the compiler is required
 to make the mentioned deductions or the code must be
 nonconforming. If the code is intended to be nonconforming,
 edits to say so might be needed.

EDITS

To be supplied.
