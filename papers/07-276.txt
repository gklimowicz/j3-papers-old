Details

We seem to have forgotten to specify that co-arrays are not interoperable.
In fact, reading Clause 15 says nothing about co-rank.

Edits:
--------

[487:8,13] Replace "is interoperable if its type" with:
"is interoperable if it is not a co-array, its type"

[487:8,13] Add a comma after the second (non-bolded) "interoperable"
