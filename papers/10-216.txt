1. Introduction

5.2.7p2 of 10-165r2 states
  "It is possible for a C function to acquire memory through a function
   ***such as malloc*** ..."
(emphasis added).  This sentence is good.

However, the paragraph ends with
  "The memory may be released by reference to the free library function
   in a C function."
which is true only if the memory acquisition was precisely through malloc
and not via some other means such as mmap or VirtualAlloc.

Furthermore, whether the user is permitted to do this is entirely within
the scope of the C standard (or Posix, or Win32, or ...) and outwith the
scope of the TR.


2. Edits to 10-165r2

[12:37-38] Delete "The memory ... C function.".
