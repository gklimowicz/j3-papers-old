QUESTION:

Consider

  PURE FUNCTION F(X)
    REAL,VALUE :: X
    F = X**2
  END FUNCTION

This subprogram does not conform to the Fortran 2003 standard, but
appears to conform to the Fortran 2008 standard, as constraints C1276
and C1277 (in Fortran 2008) have been modified to remove the previous
requirement for an INTENT specification in the case of arguments that
have the VALUE attribute.

However, this is not mentioned as a change in the Introduction.

Was this change inadvertant?

ANSWER:

No, this change was deliberate.  An edit is provided to clarify.

EDITS:

[xvi] Introduction, paragraph 2, last bullet point:
      Before "An impure"
      Insert the new sentence
        "An argument to a pure procedure may have default INTENT if
         it has the VALUE attribute.".
