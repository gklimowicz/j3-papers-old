Typos:

[65:39-41] Move Note 5.3 after [65:47]
   The note currently sits amongst the constraints, but doesn't refer to a
   preceding constraint.

[79:9] Change "nore"
       to     "more"

[83:5] Change "if"
       to     "of"

[394:26] Change "|"
         to     ":"

The following items were missing in the fix for issue 147 in 99-205r2.  Those
edits introduced a <language-binding-spec> for use in the BIND statement,
BIND attribute and BIND <prefix-spec> syntax, but neglected to complete the
changes for the BIND <prefix-spec>.

[265:40] Change "BIND(C [, <bind-spec-list>])"
         to     "<language-binding-spec>"

[266:1]  Change "BIND"
         to     "a <language-binding-spec>"

[266:2]  Change "A <bind-spec>"
         to     "A <language-binding-spec> with a <bind-spec>"

[266:4]  Change "The BIND <prefix-spec>"
         to     "A <language-binding-spec>"

The following edit was missing from the fix for issue 163.  That issue required
binding labels to not be treated as global entities, but rather as things that
identify global entities.  The glossary entry for entity still includes a
binding label in the list of things that are entities.

[397:13] Delete ", a binding label"

An earlier version of this paper contained edits to address, in part,
Unresolved issue 218.  Those edits are deferred to another paper.

Issue 229.  Paper 99-205r2 introduced a subclause for the term binding label
and added a reference to it.  Paper 99-270r1 removed the subclause without
adjusting the reference.  These edits remedy that.

[341:13] Change "(???)"
         to     "(12.5.2.7, 16.2.7.1)"

[341:14-18] Delete Unresolved issue 229.
