1. Edits w.r.t. 07-007r2

[279:26-28]---------------------------------------------------------------
It is specified that the entire output field is filled with asterisks if
the number edit descriptor specifies the exponent width and the number of
digits in the exponent is greater than the specified width.  At [282:1-2],
[283:1-2], and [284:1-2] it simply says the edit descriptor form that
doesn't specify the exponent width shall not be used if |exp| > 999.  What
happens if this dictum is violated?  Does an error occur?  What's wrong
with filling the field with asterisks?

If we want to fill it with asterisks insert the sentence "If |exp|>999
using the Ew.d, Dw.d, ENw.d, ESw.d or Gw.d edit descriptors, the processor
shall fill the entire field of width <w> with asterisks." after
"asterisks."  Then delete "The edit ... 999." at [282:1-2], [283:1-2], and
[284:1-2].

In any case, the first sentence of item (5) should be reversed because it
seems to say that the field is filled with asterisks only if the format is
one of the four mentioned ones.  Replace the first sentence of item (5) by
"On output, if an exponent exceeds its specified width using the Ew.dEe,
ENw.dEe, ESw.dEe or Gw.dEe edit descriptors, or if the number of
characters produced exceeds the the field width, the processor shall fill
the entire field of width <w> with asterisks."
