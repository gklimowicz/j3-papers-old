TITLE:  asterisks as I/O units
KEYWORDS:  asterisk, I/O, unit
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS:  submitted

QUESTION:

Does the Fortran 95 standard require the external
unit corresponding to the I/O unit identified
by an asterisk for input or output to be the same
as the external unit identified by some fixed
nonnegative integer value?

Can the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for
input or output correspond to more than one
external unit?

If the external unit identified by an integer
value that corresponds to the I/O unit identified
by an asterisk for input or output is closed, does
that cause the I/O unit identified by an asterisk
to become disconnected?

ANSWER:

Discussion:

At least one Fortran 95 implementation uses -1 as
the value of the I/O unit identified by an asterisk.
A carefully constructed INQUIRE statement can
expose this value to the user.

Many users expect I/O to the units identified by
asterisks to continue to work even after the
corresponding units identified by integer values
have been closed.
