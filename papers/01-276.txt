Subject:  General questions about 007

Here are four general topics that didn't seem to fit into the chapter by
chapter approach for detailed comments.  I'm also doing separate papers
for each of the first seven chapters with detailed comments.

References:

Should we get rid of all of the references?  They are spotty at best.
If not, let's assign somebody not named Richard the task of going
through and making sure that we consistently reference things that need
to be referenced.  I think we should delete them all and turn them into
index entries instead.   See e.g. 2.2.3.4 references to 12.3 and 12.4;
nobody will follow them forward.  See also last 3 sentences on page 29.
The terms are all in the glossary/index

Other changes such as
Page 12, 2..2.3.2   remove reference to R213.  adds nothing to the text

Page 13, 2.2.3.3   remove reference to R211   adds nothing to the text

make me think we would be better off to start over.

Enhancements
Could we add an appendix E or so that has the BNF rules and
constraints?   Ala F77 railroad tracks?

Page 64 C522.  Why don't we allow initialization of allocatable
objects?  We allow an allocatable object to be of derived type and allow
every component in the type to be initialized.  Why not allow the easy
case?

R525, etc.  Isn't this a case where -list could be used on the right of
the BNF?  I've noticed a few cases where we have BNF like
        thing1     IS     thing2 [,thing2]...
but thing2-list is equivalent.
