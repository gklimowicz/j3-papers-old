From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Interpretation re pure procedures and VOLATILE
Date: 2008 November 19

NUMBER: F03/0126
TITLE: References to VOLATILE variables in pure procedures
KEYWORDS: VOLATILE, PURE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
Was it intended to allow a VOLATILE variable to be referenced
in a pure procedure?

ANSWER:

No.  It was intended that the result of invoking a pure function in a
FORALL assignment statement should never depend on the order in which
the invocations are executed, see NOTE 12.44.  The value of a variable
with the VOLATILE attribute might change between invocations of the
function in ways incompatible with this design.

EDIT:

[286:22+] In 12.6, Pure procedures, add a new constraint:

  "C1271a The <designator> of a variable with the VOLATILE attribute
          shall not appear in a pure subprogram."
