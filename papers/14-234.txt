-----------

There is a bug in the code for the call to CFI_section in C.10.12. The
second argument in the propotype for CFI_section is

   const CFI_cdesc_t * source

The variable int_array is a formal parameter for set_odd declared

   CFI_cdesc_t  * int_array

which is already the correct type declaration for the second argument
to CFI_section. So the second argument to the call to CFI_section in
the example should be just int_array.


Edits to 14-007r2:
-----------------

[561:43] In C.10.12 change "(CFI_cdesc_t *) &int_array" to
"int_array".
