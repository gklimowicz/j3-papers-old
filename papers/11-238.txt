Comment GB36 says that a note with a simple example would be helpful
for 5.3.7, para 2 of WG5/N1869. Here is a suggestion for that note.

Add after 5.3.7, para 2 of WG5/N1869:

NOTE 5.12
The situation is illustrated by the code fragment
     real ary(1000),b
     interface
        real function Cfun(array) bind(c)
           real array(:)
        end function Cfun
     end interface
     b = Cfun(ary)
where Cfun is a C function. Before Cfun is invoked, the processor
will create a C descriptor for the array ary as an assumed-shape array.
On return from Cfun this C descriptor becomes undefined, as do any
C pointers that were made to point to any part of ary via this
descriptor during the execution of Cfun.
