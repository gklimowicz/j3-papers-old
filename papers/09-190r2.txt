Discussion:

UTI 160 (page 196) points out that Note 8.44 is defective. The first
sentence refers to the requirement that detecting a stopped image is
required, but ignores all the new error conditions associated with
locks whose detection is required.  The UTI also suggests that the
processor dependent statement be normative and added in Annex A.


Edits are supplied to correct these issues.

Edits to 09-007r1:

[130:27-31] Join paragraphs 10, 9 and 11 into a single paragraph in that
   	    order, and prepend the sentence:
  "The set of error conditions for an ALLOCATE statement is processor
   dependent."

[132:13-16] Join paragraphs 4, 3 and 5 into a single paragraph in that
	    order, and prepend the sentence:
  "The set of error conditions for a DEALLOCATE statement is
   processor dependent."

[196] Fix missing space before references (many times) on this page.

[196:8,18] Change "error" to "error condition", in both places.

[196:26+] Following para 5 of 8.5.7 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers on
image control statements, add a new paragraph:
  "The set of error conditions that can occur in an image control statement
   is processor dependent."
{This is more like how we say it for i/o errors.}

[196:Note 8.44] Replace all of the body of Note 8.44 with:
  "A processor might detect communication failure between images and
   treat it as an error condition.  A processor might also treat an invalid
   set of images in a SYNC IMAGES statement as an error condition."

[196] Delete UTI 160.

[463:37+] Insert new list item
  "- the set of error conditions that can occur in ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE
     statements (6.7.1, 6.7.3);"
{The statements about the error conditions being processor dependent are
 actually in 6.7.1.2 and 6.7.3.1, but other subclauses nearby discuss the
 "standard" error conditions so referencing the whole statement subclauses
 is better.}

[464:21+] In the list of things processor dependent in Annex A,
  insert new list item
    "- the set of error conditions that can occur in image control
       statements (8.5.7);".
{The cross-ref is actually to the STAT= specifier, but that's where we
 talk about the error conditions.}
