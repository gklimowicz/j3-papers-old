Subject: Binding label fixes

The wording of the material on binding labels on 16.1 is inconsistent
and can be misinterpreted.  The first sentence says that procedure
binding labels are global entities.  However, the third sentence then
talks about "A binding label of a global entity".  It is my belief
that the "of a global entity" in the third sentence was intended
to be descriptive rather than restrictive.

By the glossary definition of "global entity", anything with a
binding label is a global entity.  If we say it that way, it directly
corresponds to the definition of global entity and avoids missing
cases.  The current words miss the case of module procedures
with binding labels and thus are actually incorrect, at least
by implication.

  [405:18-19] "procedure binding labels...BIND attribute" ->
    "and entities with binding labels"
  [405:22-23] "A binding label of a global entity" ->
              "A binding label of an entity"
  [405:23-24] "the binding label of any other global entity" ->
              "the binding label of any other entity"
  [405:24] "a name of any other global entity" ->
           "the name of any other global entity"
           {The unique name; not some possible local name.}
  [405:25] "A global entity" -> "An entity"
