Subject: Interpretation request re SPACING

NUMBER: F03/00xx
TITLE: Inconsistency with Fortran 95 re SPACING
KEYWORDS: IEEE_SCALB, IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The result of SPACING in Fortran 2003 is different from that in
Fortran 95 (and Fortran 90). In the lines 1-2 of Result Value,
"b^{e-p}, ... , provided this result is within range. " has been
replaced by "b^{max(e-p,e_MIN-1)}, ... .". Was this intended?

This affects values that are slightly larger than
TINY(X). If denorms are available, they may be used to accurately
return the spacing of numbers in the Brown model (13.4).
For example, in Fortran 95, this program
  program test
    real x
    x = TINY(1.0)*4
    do i= 1,6
       write(*,*) x, spacing(x)
       x= x/2
    end do
  end program
on a machine that fully supports the IEEE standard returns
   4.7019774E-38   5.6051939E-45
   2.3509887E-38   2.8025969E-45
   1.1754944E-38   1.4012985E-45
   5.8774718E-39   1.1754944E-38
   2.9387359E-39   1.1754944E-38
   1.4693679E-39   1.1754944E-38
It is correctly returning the spacing of values within the Brown
model, which is what the Description promises. On a machine with
no denorms it returns
  4.7019774E-38  1.1754944E-38
  2.3509887E-38  1.1754944E-38
  1.1754944E-38  1.1754944E-38
  0.0000000E+00  1.1754944E-38
  0.0000000E+00  1.1754944E-38
  0.0000000E+00  1.1754944E-38
so it does not return the spacing of values within the Brown
model (it cannot).

It seems undesirable to require the incorrect behaviour on machines
that fully support the IEEE standard.


ANSWER:

No. It was intended that this definition be consistent with
that in Fortran 95. An edit is supplied.


EDITS:

Page and line numbers refer to J3/04-007.

[353:8-9] Subclause 13.7.113, Result Value, lines 1-2.
Replace "b^{max(e-p,e_MIN-1)}" by "b^{e-p}" and add
", provided this result is representable" at the end of the sentence.
