NUMBER: F03/0108
TITLE: Is IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN consistent with the other IEEE_SUPPORT
       functions
KEYWORDS: IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN, IEEE support functions
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:
The restriction of IEEE_IS_NAN requires that IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN returns
the value true.  The restrictions for the similar functions
IEEE_IS_{FINITE, NEGATIVE, and NORMAL} all require that
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE be true.  This is a much stronger restriction.

Should IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN also require that IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE
return true?


ANSWER:

Yes, an edit is supplied to correct the IEEE_IS_NAN restriction.

EDITS:

[375:10]
In section 14.10.9, IEEE_IS_NAN, in the "Restriction" line, change
"IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN" to "IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE"
