In UTI 005, the Editor quite reasonably remarks that effective arguments
are not addresses, and recommends that the offending paragraph be split
into two for the cases described.

The following is proposed as a resolution:

{rewrite the paragraph as two}

[454:1-6] replace paragraph 5 with the following

"In an invocation from Fortran of an interoperable procedure whose
Fortran interface has a dummy argument that is assumed shape or assumed
rank with the CONTIGUOUS attribute, or is of type CHARACTER with
assumed character length, the processor shall ensure that a contiguous
object is passed for such an argument.

In an invocation from C of an interoperable procedure whose Fortran
interface has a dummy argument that is assumed shape or assumed rank
with the CONTIGUOUS attribute, or is of type CHARACTER with assumed
character length, the invoking procedure shall ensure that the C
descriptor for such an argument describes a contiguous object."
