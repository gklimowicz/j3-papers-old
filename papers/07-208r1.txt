Discussion

We agree that it is desirable to check calls of the FORM_TEAM intrinsic
subroutine, where the check's affect on performance would be less
significant.  Assuming a team is cleanly formed, it should not later
become defective, so checks in later usage would be unnecessary.


Edits to J3/07-007r1:

[377:17-19] In 13.7.70 FORM_TEAM, in the description of the IMAGES 
argument, replace

", and shall ... THIS_IMAGE()."
by
". An error condition occurs unless:
   (1) IMAGES specifies the same set of images on all images of the team,
   (2) all the elements of IMAGES have values in the range
       1, ... , NUM_IMAGES() and there are no repeated values, and
   (3) one of the elements of IMAGES has the value THIS_IMAGE()."

[377:28-29] In 13.7.70 FORM_TEAM, replace para. 4 by
"If FORM_TEAM is invoked by an image, an error condition occurs unless
it is invoked by the same statement on all images specified by the
IMAGES argument. In the absence of an error condition, there is an
implicit team synchronization after the team is formed."
