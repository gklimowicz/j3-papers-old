Subject: Count of derived types in IEEE modules

Introduction
------------

The introductory sentence in 17.2 (Derived types, constants, and operators
defined in the modules) begins:

"The modules IEEE_EXCEPTIONS, IEEE_ARITHMETIC, and IEEE_FEATURES define 
five derived types..." William Clodius correctly observed that there are
currently six derived types defined in these modules, not five. Malcolm
Cohen then observed that the specific count might be seem to restrict an
implementation from adding additional types. The text should be reworded 
to remove the specific count.

In the process of reviewing this, I noticed that paragraphs 2 through 4,
which name derived types, constants and operators in the three modules,
have inconsistent introductory sentences. 

Paragraph 2: "The module IEEE_EXCEPTIONS defines the following types." It
then lists types and named constants.

Paragraph 3: "The module IEEE_ARITHMETIC defines the following types, 
constants, and operators." This is an accurate summary.

Paragraph 4: "The module IEEE_FEATURES defines the type IEEE_FEATURES_TYPE,
for expressing the need for particular ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 features."
The paragraph also lists named constants, and unlike the preceding two
paragraphs, is not a bullet list (probably because it lists only one type.)

I suggest that the introductory sentences of paragraphs 2 and 4 be revised
to properly summarize their contents. No technical changes are proposed in
this paper.

Edits
-----

[452:6, 17.2p1]

Replace "define five derived types" with "define various derived types"

[452:8, 17.2p2]

Replace:

"The module IEEE_EXCEPTIONS defines the following types."

with:

"The module IEEE_EXCEPTIONS defines the following types and constants."

[452:31-35, 17.2p4]

Insert after "The module IEEE_FEATURES defines" the text " the following
types and constants."

Convert the rest of the paragraph into a bullet, capitalizing the first
word "The", so that the bullet begins:

"The type IEEE_FEATURES_TYPE..."
