This is a set of edits to F2008 09-007r1 for fixes passed at
meeting 188 for F2003 interps.

1. Paper 09-194r1 - F2003 interp F03/0131

   In 5.7.1.2 "Equivalence association" [113:6+] insert new paragraph

    "If any data object in an <equivalence-set> has the SAVE attribute,
     all other objects in the <equivalence-set> have the SAVE attribute;
     this may be confirmed by explicit specification."

2. Paper 09-195 - F2003 interp F03/0132

  In 9.6.3 "Data transfer input/output list" [220:13-15] replace bullet
  with

   "If a derived-type list item is not processed by a user-defined
    derived-type input/output procedure and is not treated as a list of
    its individual components, all the subcomponents of that list item
    shall be accessible in the scoping unit containing the input/output
    statement and shall not be pointers or allocatable".

3. Paper 09-204 - F2003 interp F03/0133

   In 5.7.2.1 "General" C597 [114:25] after "BIND attribute," insert

    "an unlimited polymorphic pointer,"

3. Paper 09-205 - F2003 interp F03/0024

   In 6.7.3.3 "Deallocation of pointer targets" [133:31] after "by
   allocation." insert new sentence

    "The pointer shall have the same dynamic type and type parameters
     as the allocated object, and if the allocated object is an array
     the pointer shall be an array whose elements are the same as
     those of the allocated object in array element order."

4. Paper 09-217 - F2003 interp F03/0130 contained no edits so no
   edit is needed in F2008

5. Paper 090-221r1 - F2003 interp F03/0034

   Subclause 14.11.13 "IEEE_LOGB (X)" Result value [416:29+] add:

    "Case (iii) If IEEE_SUPPORT_INF(X) is true and X is infinite, the
                result is +infinity.
     Case (iv) If IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN(X) is true and X is a NaN, the result
               is a NaN."

6. Paper 09-222r1 - F2003 interp F03/0039

   In 14.12 "Examples" [428] delete note 14.17

   The HYPOT example in note 14.17 is too easily confused with the
   ointrinsic function HYPOT.

7. Paper 09-223r1 - F2003 interp F03/0022

   In 14.1 "General" 1st sentence of 2nd paragraph [405:9-10] replace

     "for all kinds of real and complex data"

   with

    "for all kinds of real and complex IEEE floating-point data"
