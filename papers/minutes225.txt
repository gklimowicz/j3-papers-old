   2. National Items
      1. Liaison reports
         1. INCITS report (if any) - B. Friesen
            Updated to Annex A that includes a new item
         2. IEEE 754 report (if any) - R. Corbett
             Robert reminded us that that his was his last meeting and
             a new liason should be chosen
         3. MPI Liaison report (if any) - B. Long
              MPI 4.0 is the current release. There was some work on
              MPI_Count for greater than 32-bit counts (for MPI 4.1),
              and in the process some of the Fortran interfaces might
              have been overlooked. If needed, fixes in 4.1 errata or
              version 4.2.  (Actually could have just made the Fortran
              interfaces generic and no need for new forms.)
             Q: Steidel asked if there was any support for image failures
             A:  Long does not think so.
         4. OpenMP Liaison report (if any) - B. Long

           Deemed of lower priority, subsumed by conditional

        /Edit
** Motion 21-180 "Edited constraint in F2018" [Steidel](Cohen/Steidel)
         As amended UC

        Discussion of edits for 21-189, which contains several
        alternatives requiring straw votes.
          Results will be presented in a revision paper.

        1) In the table for "Type of operands and results for intrinsic
           operators" should we have a new code for "enum type"
        New code   Incorporate it into E      Undecided
           9                 6                  8
        Majority decision is to have a new code which should be:
          En   N  Undecided
           2   11   10

        2)In section on SELECT CASE, addition of enum as a CASE could make
          the wording awkward.  The existing convention is to use "type"
          before intrinsic type name and after enum, enumeration, derived
        Keep to our existing convention Change these two only  Undecided
                16                             4                     4

        3) Suggestion to replace "homomorphic" used in description of
           "Interoperable enumerations and enum types" because it is not
           accurate.
         Isomorphic  Has 1 to 1  Undecided
            4          15           3

      2. Tutorials (if needed)   None needed
      3. Subgroup reports (if needed)  Nothing added.

      1. Closing business - B. Friesen
         Last J3 before committee draft.  What happens next?
         Issue the CD by December which goes to ISO for an ISO level vote.
         Ballot results in March
         Disc constructed April
         WG5 meeting would evaluate disc.
         February meeting is a deep dive into the CD and to vote on the
           draft.

      2. Future meetings - B. Friesen
         The February meeting will be remote.
         Brian noted that it is important to incorporate hybrid in
         future meetings; could cause meeting fee to increase a lot
         to cover cost of video equipment.
         One option to resolve the cost is to have rotating hosts.
