1. Introduction

This paper contains a revised answer to interp request F03/0128 together
with an edit to apply the fix to Fortran 2008.

NUMBER: F03/0128
TITLE: Subobjects in namelist output
KEYWORDS: NAMELIST
DEFECT TYPE: Error
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
Was it intended to disallow vendors to provide namelist output that
includes a subobject designator followed by a value?

ANSWER:
No, it was intended that vendors should have the same choice as users
writing namelist input as to whether to provide the name of an object
followed by a list of values that give the value of the object or to
provide a sequence of subobject designators, each followed by a list
giving the value of the subobject.

DISCUSSION:
At the start of clause 10.10.2 (Namelist Output) of the Fortran
2003 standard, as amended by Corrigendum 3, is the text
"The form of the output produced is the same as that required for
input, except for the forms of real, character, and logical values, and
output produced with user-defined derived-type output".
There is no exception for the freedom on input to use subobject
designators.

The text in the second paragraph of clause 10.10.2.2, says "The name
of each namelist group object list item is placed in the output record
followed by an equals and a list of values of the namelist group object
list item.". The intention here was to use "name" in the generalized
sense of name or designator, as in paragraph 1 of clause 10.10.1.1:
"If a namelist group object is an array, the input record corresponding
to it may contain either the array name or the designator of a
subobject of that array, using the syntax of object designators (R603).
If the namelist group object name is the name of a variable of
derived type, the name in the input record may be either the name of
the variable or the designator of one of its components, indicated by
qualifying the variable name with the appropriate component name."

Because of the meaning attached to "name", in the rest of the standard,
it should not be used in this way in clause 10.10.2.2.

EDIT:
[247:17] In 10.10.2.2, Namelist output records, paragraph 2, change
"The name" to "The name or designator".
