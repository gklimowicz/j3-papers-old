From: Bill Long
Subject: Interop TR: Multiple includes of header file
Date: 2010 October 12
Reference: 10-165r2.pdf

Discussion:

Paragraph 2 of 5.2.1 Summary of contents of the ISO_Fortran_binding.h
file deals with what happens if the header file is included more than
once.  It was proposed at 192 that we should more closely mirror the
wording used in the C standard. While my notes indicated page 179 of
C99, I believe that the intended citation is to paragraph 4, sentence
1 of 7.1.2 'Standard headers' on page 165, which states:

 "Standard headers may be included in any order; each may be included
 more than once in a given scope, with no effect different from being
 included only once, except that the effect of including <assert.h>
 depends on the definition of NDEBUG (see 7.2)."

The current TR wording related to line numbers was not objectionable.

Edits to 10-165r2:

[9:14-15] Replace 5.2.1 para 2 with:

"ISO_Fortran_binding.h may be included in any order relative to the
standard C headers, and may be included more than once in a given
scope, with no effect different from being included only once, other
than the effect on line numbers."
