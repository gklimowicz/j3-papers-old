Discussion:

Comment GB10 in the UK Ballot observes that the phrase "describing the
object" in the description of the dv formal parameter to the
CFI_allocate function is too vague.  The members of the descriptor are
as follows:

base_addr : should be a null pointer on entry.

elem_len : should be set unless the descriptor is for a Fortran
           character.

version  : always defined. No mention needed here.

rank     : should be set on entry.

type     : should be set on entry.

attribute : should be set - second sentence of the dv description
            already covers this.

dims : Ignored on entry - redefined if the function completes
       successfully.



Comment GB11 in the UK Ballot, as clarified by subsequent email
inquiry, observes that the phrase "the C descriptor is updated" in the
last paragraph before the "Result Value" part of 5.3.5.4
CFI_deallocate.  The only member of the descriptor that has to be
updated is base_addr which becomes a null pointer.


Edits to N1869:


5.3.5.3 CFI_allocate, in the description of the dv formal parameter,
change "describing the object." to "specifying the rank and type of
the object. On entry, the base_addr member of the C descriptor shall
be a null pointer, and the elem_len member shall specify the element
length for the type unless the type is a character type."

5.3.5.4 CFI_deallocate, in the last paragraph before "Result Value",
change "the C descriptor is updated" to "the base_addr member of the C
descriptor becomes a null pointer".
