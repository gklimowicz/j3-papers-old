Subject: Add synchronization for FORM SUBTEAM
Date: 2013 June 26
Re: N1967

It was noted that the description of FORM SUBTEAM does not specify
that it causes a synchronization across all images in the current
team. An edit is supplied to correct this.

--------------

[5.4 FORM SUBTEAM:p10 20-22] Insert a new paragraph after line 22:

When a FORM SUBTEAM statement is executed, there is an implicit
synchronization of all images in the current team. On these images,
execution of the segment (8.5.2) following the statement is delayed
until all other images in the current team have executed the same
statement the same number of times.
