Introduction
____________

As explained in X3J3/97-141, three cases can occur when interval
intrinsics are called:

1. The argument can be entirely within the domain of definition.
2. The the argument can be partially within the domain of definition.
3. The argument can be totally outside the domain of definition.

For example, SQRT((<0.0,1.0>)) falls under the first case,
SQRT((<-1.0,1.0>))
falls under the second case, and SQRT((<-1.0,-0.5>)) falls under the
third case.  In some user applications in which the second case occurs,
it is appropriate to return an enclosure for the range over the valid
portion of the domain, while, in other applications, it is appropriate
to stop.

Paper X3J3/97-141 has been discussed within the group of "interval
experts," with the following consensus.

Proposed Syntax
________ ______

There shall be two exception flags associated with the interval
intrinsics:


There shall be a data type INTERVAL_FLAG TYPE, with two possible
values:   INTERVAL_OUT_OF_RANGE and INTERVAL_POSSIBLY_OUT_OF_RANGE.

The following elemental subroutines shall access the flags.
In them, FLAG shall be one of INTERVAL_OUT_OF_RANGE and
INTERVAL_POSSIBLY_OUT_OF_RANGE.  FLAG_VALUE and HALTING are logical
variables.  FLAG_VALUE=.TRUE. means that the exception has occurred,
and HALTING=.TRUE. means that normal execution is discontinued when
the corresponding exception is raised. The initial value of HALTING
for both exception flags INTERVAL_OUT_OF_RANGE and
INTERVAL_POSSIBLY_OUT_OF_RANGE shall be "TRUE".  Whenever HALTING
for FLAG is .TRUE. and evaluation of an expression causes FLAG_VALUE
to be set to .TRUE., halting is not necessarily immediate, but normal
execution does not continue.

INTERVAL_POSSIBLY_OUT_OF_RANGE shall be .TRUE. whenever
INTERVAL_OUT_OF_RANGE is .TRUE.


  INTERVAL_GET_FLAG(FLAG,FLAG_VALUE) Get an exception flag.

  INTERVAL_GET_HALTING_MODE(FLAG, HALTING)  Get halting mode for an
    exception.  Halting is not necessarily immediate, but normal
    processing does not continue.

  INTERVAL_SET_FLAG(FLAG,FLAG_VALUE) Set an exception flag.

  INTERVAL_SET_HALTING_MODE(FLAG,HALTING)  Controls continuation or
    halting on interval exceptions.

These specifications of the above four elemental
subroutines are consistent with the specifications of
IEEE_GET_FLAG, IEEE_GET_HALTING_MODE, IEEE_SET_FLAG, and
IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE as defined in ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5 - N1231,
"Technical Report for Floating Point Exception Handling."

If the value of the halting mode INTERVAL_POSSIBLY_OUT_OF_RANGE
is .FALSE., then the argument of the intrinsic is intersected
with the valid domain of the interval intrinsic.
(The valid domain of an interval intrinsic function shall be the
set of intervals contained in the valid domain of the
corresponding floating point intrinsic function.)


Examples
________

1. Upon evaluation of SQRT(<-1.0,-0.5>), both
   INTERVAL_OUT_OF_RANGE and INTERVAL_POSSIBLY_OUT_OF_RANGE are
   set to .TRUE.

2. Suppose INTERVAL_OUT_OF_RANGE and INTERVAL_POSSIBLY_OUT_OF_RANGE
   are both .FALSE. immediately prior to evaluation of the
   expression SQRT(<-1.0,1.0>).  Upon evaluation of SQRT(<-1.0,1.0>),
   INTERVAL_OUT_OF_RANGE remains .FALSE. but
   INTERVAL_POSSIBLY_OUT_OF_RANGE is set to .TRUE.  If HALTING
   for INTERVAL_POSSIBLY_OUT_OF_RANGE is .FALSE., then execution
   continues, and the value of SQRT(<-1.0,1.0>) is the same as
   the value of SQRT(<0.0,1.0>).
