Date:         17 November 2000
To:           J3
From:         Jeanne Martin
Subject:      Proposed Work Plan

There are 7 meetings before F2000 is to be submitted to WG5 in June of
2002.  Note that there are only 3 meetings left to complete F95
interpretations that contain edits.

J3 should maintain the current committee organization for the next three
meetings saving the last four for integration. There are 75 outstanding
unresolved issues.  They have been categorized them into 2 levels for
each of the 3 subgroups and the exception TR development body.  The
levels are 1) crucial and 2) can be deferred to integration if
necessary.  The numbers for each group are:

            crucial             deferrable
JOR           11                    3
DATA          16.5                 14
INTEROP       14.5                 12
Except. TR    2                     2

[See below for actual issue numbers.  There is one issue assigned to
both DATA and INTEROP accounting for the decimal.]

To meet the deadline, J3 must complete at least the following
assignments for the next 3 meetings or inform WG5 that the date has
slipped:

Meeting 155
JOR          resolve any 6 of the crucial issues
DATA         resolve any 9 of the crucial issues
INTEROP      resolve any 8 of the crucial issues
Except. TR   resolve any 2 of the 4 issues

Meeting 156
Each group must resolve any issues arising from the previous meeting,
and the remaining crucial issues.

Meeting 157
Resolve issues arising from the previous meeting, any remaining crucial
unresolved issues and as many of the deferred issues as time allows.

Also during meetings 155 through 157, J3 will be processing
interpretations, concentrating on those that contain edits (somewhat
unpredictable at the outset).  The Interp Subgroup can suggest a
categorization of the interps into those that are crucial and those that
can be deferred.  Any committee member submitting a new interp must
include at least one possible answer.

After meeting 157 (and the 2001 WG5 meeting), the committee is
reconstituted for integration.  There will be 3 subgroups (This seems to
be the optimum number given the committee size and fluctuating
attendance.)  For identification, call the new subgroups A, B, and C.
The document will be divided into 3 Parts (based loosely on number of
pages):

Part 1: Introduction through Section 7
Part 2: Sections 8 through 12
Part 3: Section 13 through Appendix C

Each SG should attempt to resolve any remaining issues in its assigned
section and resolve any inconsistencies, ambiguities, etc. with other
parts of the document.  The assignments are:

Meeting 158                Meeting 159               Meeting 160
SG A     Part 1            SG A     Part 2           SG A     Part 3
SG B     Part 2            SG B     Part 3           SG B     Part 1
SG C     Part 3            SG C     Part 1           SG C     Part 2

Meeting 161
Any remaining issues are resolved.  Everyone proofreads the entire
document.

                               -----

Criteria for selecting which of the unresolved issues are most crucial
for early resolution were:

1) The serious ones that arose from papers at the last meeting, because
the issues should still be fresh in people's minds.
2) Those that only the originating SG has the expertise to handle.
3) Those that need to be resolved in order to straighten out the
terminology, so that nongroup members can help deal with interactions.
4) Topics that give rise to related issues that need to be dealt with
concurrently.

The following are listed in document order per SG.  Page numbers are
from 00-007R3.

INTEROP
The following 7 unresolved issues appear within 2 pages of 00-007R3 (p.
273-274) in subsection 12.5.3 (only 17 lines of text).  It would be very
nice if subsection 12.5.3 could become issue-free at meeting 155.  The 7
issues are 282, 204, 160, 239, 161, 242, and 250.  Apart from this
subsection, INTEROP's issues are:
