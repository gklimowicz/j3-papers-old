1. Discussion

Two cases of pointer component default initialization involving BLOCK
constructs are missing from 16.5.2.3 and 16.5.2.4.

Several cases of pointer undefinition are not enumerated in 16.5.2.5.

Several related groups of list items can be brought together by
factoring.

2. Edits

[451:14+ 16.5.2.3p1(2)+]------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert the following list item:

"(2a) The pointer is a subcomponent of an object that is allocated by an
      ALLOCATE statement in which SOURCE= appears and the corresponding
      subcomponent of <source-expr> is associated."

[451:20+ 16.5.2.3p1(4)(b) after its first line] and
[451:32+ 16.5.2.4p1(4)(b) after its first line]-------------------------
Editor: Insert the same list item (before "or") in both cases

"(b') a BLOCK statement is executed and this object is an unsaved
      nonpointer nonallocatable local variable of the BLOCK
      construct,"

[451:22 16.5.2.3p1(4)(c), 451:34 16.5.2.4p1(4)(c)]----------------------
Editor:  Replace both items by the following item:

"(c) the object is allocated other than by an ALLOCATE statement in
     which SOURCE= appears."

{This includes the case of automatic allocation.}

[451:27 16.5.2.4p1(3)]--------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete "or" at the end of item (3) and insert the following list
item:

"(3a) the pointer is a subcomponent of an object that is allocated by an
      ALLOCATE statement in which SOURCE= appears and the corresponding
      subcomponent of <source-expr> is disassociated, or"

[452:8 16.5.2.5p1(8)]---------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "execution of a RETURN or END statement" by "completion
of execution of an instance of a subprogram".

[452:12-13 16.5.2.5p1(7)]-----------------------------------------------
Editor:  Delete "by execution of a RETURN or END statement" (how else?)

[452:14 16.5.2.5p1(8)]--------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "a procedure ... statement" by "execution of an instance
or a subprogram completes" (compare to [459:14 16.6.6p1(3)]).

[452:25+ 16.5.2.5p1(10)+]-----------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert a list item:

"(10') the pointer is a subcomponent of an object that is allocated and
       either
       (a) the pointer is not default-initialized and SOURCE= does not
           appear, or
       (b) SOURCE= appears and the association status of the
           corresponding subcomponent of <source-expr>is undefined,
"

{(10')(a) also covers the case of automatic allocation.}
