NUMBER: F08/0105
TITLE: Is the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute allowed with the VALUE attribute?
KEYWORDS: ASYNCHRONOUS, VALUE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

In the description of the VALUE attribute, [101:23-24] section
5.3.18p1, constraint C558 disallows the VOLATILE attribute with the
VALUE attribute:

  "C558 An entity with the VALUE attribute shall not have the
        ALLOCATABLE, INTENT (INOUT), INTENT (OUT), POINTER, or
        VOLATILE attributes."

But there is no prohibition of the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute with the
VALUE attribute.  Should this combination also be disallowed?

ANSWER:

No, the combination of VALUE and ASYNCHRONOUS attributes should not
be disallowed.  That is, the combination of VALUE and ASYNCHRONOUS
attributes should continue to be allowed.

A dummy argument with the VALUE attribute can successfully take part
in asynchronous operations.  ASYNCHRONOUS is different from VOLATILE
so there is no compelling reason to treat the two with respect to
VALUE the same.

Disallowing ASYNCHRONOUS with VALUE would be a introduce an
incompatibility between F2003 and F2008.  Users would be surprised to
have currently working programs suddenly give an error.
