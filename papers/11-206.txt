1. Introduction.

This paper contains some suggestions for editorial improvements.


2. Technical Discussion

Consider procedure pointer assignment, in particular
   P => Q
for a procedure pointer P and a procedure Q,
when both are functions.

7.2.2.4 paragraph 6 says
  "If the pointer object is a function with an implicit interface,
   the pointer target shall be a function with the same type;
   corresponding type parameters shall either both be deferred or
   both have the same value."

This is confusing, because deferred type parameters are only permitted
for allocatable and pointer results, and paragraph 4 says
  "If the characteristics of the pointer object or the pointer
   target are such that an explicit interface is required,
   both the pointer object and the pointer target shall have an
   explicit interface."

Since having an allocatable or pointer result requires an explicit
interface, it is impossible for the pointer object to have an implicit
interface when either the pointer object or the target have a deferred
type parameter.

Note that although the other paragraphs in subclause 7.2.2.4 could be
usefully reworded, that would be a more ambitious undertaking.  For
now, let's just remove the prohibition of an already-impossible thing.


3. Edits

[137:5] Split "definedoperation" into two words.
{Missing space.}

[160:15] 7.2.2.4p6, delete "either both be deferred or both",
{Impossible situation, see discussion above.}
This makes that whole paragraph read
  "If the pointer object is a function with an implicit interface,
   the pointer target shall be a function with the same type;
   corresponding type parameters shall have the same value."

[297:5+2] Delete unnecessary blank line at beginning of NOTE 12.29.
{We don't have that for other notes.}

[297:5+13,5+33] After "REAL A(1000)", change "[:]" to "[*]", twice.
{Wrong syntax for nonallocatable coarray declaration.}
