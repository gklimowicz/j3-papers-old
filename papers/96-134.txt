  At the Dresden meeting, WG5/Interop investigated most of the outstanding
  technical issues of the interoperability report N1178, as well as the
  option to include a MAP_TO conversion facility into the TR.
  As a result of this work, the following conclusions can be made:


  (1) /Interop recommends to add a MAP_TO facility for automatic conversion
      of the type and/or kind of data objects of basic types, along the lines
      of X3J3/95-295. This would enhance the current facilities (KIND
      parameters for C datatypes) and diminuish the current divergence of the
      ISO and HPFF interoperability approaches.


  (2) /Interop thinks that regardless of the type mapping mechanism for
      structure components (KINDs or MAP_TO), there is a need for a layout
      clause like BIND(C) inside the TYPE definition for a C struct.


  (3) /Interop recommends that C character strings be mapped to Fortran
      CHARACTER(LEN=1) arrays as proposed in X3J3/96-106r1.


  (4) /Interop feels that a <type-alias-stmt>, which only establishes a new
      name for an existing type, does not have significant impact on
      other features of the language. It is aware of the fact that the
      current <type-alias-stmt> is not able to model ALL possible C typedef
      constructs, but only those with a well-defined meaning in Fortran.


  (5) Interfacing to operating system facilities is often dependent on the
      possibility to access global variables defined in these interfaces.
      Therefore, /Interop would like to express the necessity to provide
      a binding to C extern data objetcs.


  (6) /Interop concurs with the issues raised in N1185 about MAP_TO and
      struct mappings. Therefore, it does not recommend a "recursive mapto".
      Nevertheless, the TR-C development body is encouraged to investigate
      alternative possibilities to specify MAP_TO conversion, e.g. at the
      specification of structure components.
