Subject: Formal specs for RESTRICTION and REQUIRES
Date: 2022-July-21

Reference: 22-161r1

1. Introduction
===============

The purpose of this paper is to establish the formal specs for
the RESTRICTION construct and REQUIRES statement.

2 . Formal specs
================

A1. A RESTRICTION is a named construct for encapsulating a
    set of interfaces involving deferred types.

A2. A RESTRICTION may appear in the specification section of a MODULE,
    SUBMODULE, or a TEMPLATE.

B1. A RESTRICTION has a list of named parameters that have the
    same characteristics as those of template parameters.

    Example using notional syntax:

    RESTRICTION binary_op(op, T, U, V)
       type T; end type
       type U; end type
       type V; end type
       interface
          function op(x, y) result(z)
             type(V) :: z
             type(T), intent(in) :: x
             type(U), intent(in) :: y
          end function
       end interface
    END RESTRICTION


C. A REQUIRES statement specifies the name of a RESTRICTION and
   provides actual parameters corresponding to the restriction
   construct's parameters.

   Example using notional syntax:

      TEMPLATE metric_t(T, binop)
         REQUIRES binary_op(binop, T, T, real)
      CONTAINS
         function path_length(arr) result(x)
            type(T), intent(in) :: arr(:)
            real :: x

            integer :: i

            x = 0
            do i = 1, size(arr)-1
               x = x + binop(arr(i), arr(i+1))
            end do

         end function
      END TEMPLATE


D1. A REQUIRES statement is validated if its actual parameters conform
    to the corresponding parameters of the referenced
    RESTRICTION.

   Note: A given template parameter may be used in multiple requires
         statements.

   Example using notional syntax:

      TEMPLATE saxpy_t(T, U, V, times, plus)
         REQUIRES binary_op(times, T, U, V)
         REQUIRES binary_op(plus, V, V, V)

      contains

         subroutine saxpy(x, y, z)
           type(T), intent(in) :: x
           type(U), intent(in) :: y
           type(V), intent(inout) :: z

           z = plus(z, times(x,y))

        end subroutine
     END TEMPLATE saxpy_t

     ! The following instantiate statement is valid
     INSTANTIATE saxpy_t(real, real, real, operator(*), operator(+))

     ! The following instantiate statement is not valid, because there
     ! is no "*" operator between real and logical that returns a
     ! real.  INSTANTIATE saxpy_t(real, logical, real, operator(*),
     ! operator(+))

D2. A REQUIRES statement may appear within the specification of a
    TEMPLATE or within a RESTRICTION construct.

D3. A REQUIRES statement behaves as if the declarations within the
    referenced RESTRICTION are replicated at that location.

E. If a template parameter appears in a REQUIRES statement it does not
   need to be separately declared in the template specification
   section.

   Note: It may still be advisable to explicitly declare at least the
         type template parameters independent of any REQUIRES statements to
         provide some clarity.
