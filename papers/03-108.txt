Subject: Response to Comment

In response to a public comment on the CD,
(Comment #9 from A. Markus, point #2),
J3 agreed to recommend that constants be added
to the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
to specify the sizes of the numeric storage unit,
the character storage unit, and the file storage unit.
This paper proposes edit to do so.

EDITS:

354:9+ Add:
13.8.3.3 Size of Storage Units
The processor shall provide three constants giving
the processor-dependent sizes of the numeric storage unit,
the character storage unit, and the file storage unit,
expressed in bits.

13.8.3.3.1 NUMERIC_STORAGE_SIZE
The value of the default integer scalar constant NUMERIC_STORAGE_SIZE
is assigned the size expressed in bits of the numeric storage unit.

13.8.3.3.2 CHARACTER_STORAGE_SIZE
The value of the default integer scalar constant CHARACTER_STORAGE_SIZE
is assigned the size expressed in bits of the character storage unit.

13.8.3.3.3 FILE_STORAGE_SIZE
The value of the default integer scalar constant FILE_STORAGE_SIZE
is assigned the size expressed in bits of the file storage unit.
