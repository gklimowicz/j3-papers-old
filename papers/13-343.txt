along with {Ed} for the document editor.


Discussion - Responses with edits
---------------------------------

{Van 16}: At [15:3-4] lines are wider than the margins.  Look for
"overfull hbox" after running LaTeX.
Response: Action by the editor needed.

{Van 32}: At [21:7] Why default integer?  Why not a kind for which
HUGE(0_thatkind) >= HUGE(0)?
Response:  Agreed.  An edit is supplied.

{Dan 8}: For status values at [21:10-12] change from zero/nonzero to
=0, <0, >0. (Similar to suggestion for failed image status).
Response: Zero/nonzero occur elsewhere for intrinsic
subroutines. However, these are errors, so an edit is provided to
change nonzero to positive.

{Ed}: In the discussion of EVENT_QUERY the phrases "invocation is
successful/unsuccessful" are not consistent with usage elsewhere.
Response: Change to refer to error conditions. Edits are provided.


Discussion - Responses only
---------------------------

{Nick 12}: 7.4.11 p21 It needs to say that EVENT_QUERY may be used in
segments that are unordered with respect to EVENT POST on the same
variable.
Response: The segment ordering rules say nothing of EVENT_QUERY, so we
see no need for this. Note 7.1 makes it clear that EVENT_QUERY does
not imply any synchronization.

{Reinhold, A.2.4}: In THIS_IMAGE can the coarray argument and DISTANCE
argument both be supplied? Response:  No. The syntax at [31:2] does not
allow this.
