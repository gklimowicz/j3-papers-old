Discussion
----------

The current Scope section of the TS defers the specification of a
progress requirement. This paper proposes one, based on J3/15-139.


Edits to N2056:
---------------

[1:6-8] In 1 Scope, in para2, make these 3 edits: In the first
sentence replace "or progress models" by "model".  Delete the second
sentence "Some level ... clauses 7 and 8." In the last sentence
replace "and progress models" by "model".


[19:22+] In 8.2 Atomic subroutines, after para 1, add paragraph:

"Atomic operations shall make asynchronous progress (3.2). If the
atomic variable X[A] is defined by an atomic subroutine on image B,
image C repeatedly references X[A] by an atomic subroutine in an
unordered segment, and no other image defines X[A], image C will
eventually receive the value defined by image B, even if none of the
images A, B, or C execute an image control statement until after X[A]
is defined by image B and that value is received by image C."
