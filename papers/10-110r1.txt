DISCUSSION

The following constructions are not clearly permitted by the text of 5.3.6
CODIMENSION attribute, though they are by 13.7.172 (UCOBOUND), and there
is a clarificatory NOTE in 6.6 (Image selectors).  Neither is an obvious
place to look for the precise specification of explicit-coshape-spec.


     ! running on 17 images

     INTEGER, SAVE :: coarray_1(10)[5,*], coarray_2(10)[34,*]

    ! and similarly for ALLOCATE

The root of the problem, however, lies elsewhere. The initial description
of coarray in 2.4.7 says, in paragraph 3:

    "The set of corresponding coarrays on all images is arranged in a
    rectangular pattern.  The dimensions of this pattern are the
    codimensions; the number of codimensions is the corank. The bounds
    for each codimension are the cobounds."

In conventional mathematics, the size of a rectangle is an exact multiple
of each side, and that is not the case here.  That is confusing.  That is
also true for assumed-size arrays, but the potential for confusion there
is much less.

EDITS

[37:11+] In 2.4.7 "Coarray", after paragraph 3, add the new NOTE:

   "NOTE 2.12a
   If the total number of images is not a multiple of the product of
   the extents in each but the rightmost of the codimensions, the
   rectangular pattern will be incomplete."
