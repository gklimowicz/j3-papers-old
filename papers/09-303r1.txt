Subject: Scoping unit fixes for BLOCK construct.
Date: 2009 November 11

1. Introduction

The standard often uses "scoping unit" in contexts where we need to
consider BLOCK constructs.  This paper attempts to fix these by making
BLOCK constructs into a special kind of scoping unit.


2. Edits to 09-007r3

[15:34+] Insert new bullet item
  "- a BLOCK construct,"

[15:36+] Insert new definitions
  "1.3.115.1
   <<block scoping unit>>
   scoping unit that is a BLOCK construct

   1.3.115.2
   <<inclusive scope>>
   scoping unit including any BLOCK construct whose host is that scoping
   unit or whose host is another BLOCK construct in the inclusive scope

   Note 1.4a
   That is, inclusive scope is the scope as if BLOCK constructs were not
   scoping units.".

[44:20] 3.2.5 Statement labels, p2, 2nd sentence,
  "in a scoping unit" -> "in its scope".
{Better wording, safe against all scoping unit definition changes.}

[109:28] 5.5 IMPLICIT statement, p4, penultimate sentence,
  Change "outermost scoping unit in which it appears"
  to     "outermost inclusive scope in which it appears"
{A bit ugly, but works because "inclusive scope" is just what "scoping
 unit" used to be.}

[110:end-of-page+] end of subclause 5.5, insert new note
  "Note 5.38a
   Implicit typing is not affected by BLOCK constructs.  For example, in
     SUBROUTINE S(N)
       ...
       IF (N>0) THEN
         BLOCK
           NSQP = CEILING(SQRT(DBLE(N)))
         END BLOCK
       END IF
       ...
       IF (N>0) THEN
         BLOCK
           PRINT *,NSQP
         END BLOCK
       END IF
     END SUBROUTINE
   even if the only two appearances of NSQP are within the BLOCK
   constructs, the scope of NSQP is the whole subroutine S."

[131:4,6] 6.7.3.2 Deallocation of allocatable variables, p5,
  Delete "or BLOCK construct" and delete "or block".

[172:9+] 8.1.4 BLOCK construct, end of subclause,
  "Note 8.4a
   The following is an example of a BLOCK construct.

      IF (swapxy) THEN
        BLOCK
          REAL(KIND(x)) tmp
          tmp = x
          x = y
          y = tmp
        END BLOCK
      END IF

    Actions on a variable local to a BLOCK construct do not affect any
    variable of the same name outside the construct.  For example,

      F = 254E-2
      BLOCK
        REAL F
        F = 39.37
      END BLOCK
      ! F is still equal to 254E-2.

    A global SAVE does not affect variables local to a BLOCK construct,
    because it is a scoping unit.  For example,

      SUBROUTINE S
        ...
        SAVE
        ...
        BLOCK
          REAL X              ! Not saved.
          REAL,SAVE :: Y(100) ! SAVE attribute is allowed.
          Z = 3               ! Implicitly declared in S, thus saved.
          ...
        END BLOCK
        ...
      END SUBROUTINE"

[443:32] "scoping units" ->"the scope".
{Should have been singular before anyway.}

[444:17-19] 16.4 Statement and construct entities, p2,
  Delete whole paragraph which is now unnecessary after fixing the scope
    of global and local entities.
{Previously wrong for nested constructs, also contradicted by p4
 re statement entities.}

[444:20-27] p3 and p4, Replace both paragraphs with
  "Even if the name of a statement entity is the same as another identifier
   and the statement is in the scope of that identifier, within the scope
   of the statement entity the name is interpreted as that of the
   statement entity."
{Previously wrong when a construct entity also existed, also wrong for
 multiple statement entities in separate statements with the same name, and
 also for construct entities elsewhere.}

[444:28-29] p4, Replace first sentence with
  "The name of a statement entity shall not be the same as an accessible
   global identifier or local identifier of class (1) (16.3.1), except
   for a common block name or a scalar variable name.".
{Previously confusing and ambiguous re global identifiers.}

[445:1-3] p9, Replace first sentence "Except ... <index-name>s." with
  "If a FORALL statement, FORALL construct, or DO CONCURRENT construct does
   not have a <type-spec>, an <index-name> shall not be the same as an
   accessible global identifier, local identifier, or identifier of an
   outer construct entity, except for a common block name or a scalar
   variable name.".
{Broken for ASSOCIATE, BLOCK and SELECT TYPE.}

[445:15] 16.5.1.1p1 Forms of name association,
  "scoping unit"->"scope", twice.

  After "Use" insert "association",
  Change "scoping units" to "scopes".

[445:30] "scoping unit"->"scope", twice.


3. Non-edits

The following possibly-problematic places seem, on closer examination,
to be ok.

[58:18] This is very poorly worded and could do with rewriting.

[97:3-5] Looks ok - this is not exhaustive.

[105:9] Looks ok.

[105:18] Looks ok.

[151:4] Looks ok.

[404:1-4] Ok, except that it is self-contradictory and incomplete.
          And the last part belongs in 14.3.

[443:13,14] Probably ok.

[443:30] Probably ok.

[444:31-43] Broken already in F2003, fix this later.
