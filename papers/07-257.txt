Subject: UTI 125 (p32): Corresponding co-array for dummy co-arrays
Date: 2007 July 18
References: J3/07-007r2 (N1678)


Discussion

The Editor questions the statement:
"For each co-array on an image, there is a corresponding co-array
with the same type, type parameters, and bounds on every other image."
for dummy co-arrays.

We believe that the problem lies in Notes 12.31 and 12.32 and provide
edits to these notes.

Edits to 07-007r2:

[332:31+] In 12.5.2.9 Co-array arguments, NOTE 12.31, replace the
first two sentences by

    "The co-array on the executing image is specified as the actual
     argument and this is associated with the dummy co-array argument
     during this execution of this procedure on this image. For this
     image, there is a corresponding dummy co-array with the same
     type, type parameters, and bounds on every other image."

[333:1-] In 12.5.2.9 Co-array arguments, NOTE 12.32, replace the first
 sentence by

    "If a procedure with a nonallocatable co-array argument is invoked
    by more than one image in unordered segments, each such executing
    image has its own dummy co-array and the bounds and co-bounds of
    these dummy arrays may differ from executing image to executing
    image."
