1. Edits Accepted by JOR
========================

[32:25-26 2.2.1p2] Modules can contain private entities.  Replace "are
to" with "can".

[32:38 2.2.3p1] A processor is not required to invoke a function if it
can determine the value of an expression without it.  This implies that
it can invoke the function, and then not use the result.  Replace
"is then" with "can then be".

Part of the proposed edit was not accepted.  See section 2 below.

[33:5 2.2.4p1] Modules can contain private entities.  Replace "are
to" with "can".

[34:19 2.3.4p1] Insert "from" after "range".

[35:7+8-9 NOTE 2.5] Remove the sentence "A program ... portable" because
it's not true.

[35:9 2.3.5p1] Replace "instances of the program" with "images" because
"instances of the program" is not a defined term.

JOR disputes the reasoning but agrees that the edit is an improvement.

[36:17 2.3.7p2] Delete "(ISO/IEC 9899:2011)" because this precludes
procedures defined by means other than Fortran or C, which is explicitly
allowed by 2.5.7p2.

[37:33+2 2.4.3.2p5 last bullet] After "scalar" insert "or an array".

This is an alternative proposed by JOR.  The original was to delete
"scalar" because substring selection might produce an array.

[39:12 2.4.6p1] Before "The rank of a named array", insert: "Except for an
assumed-rank array <hyperlink to "assumed-rank dummy data object" [4:2]>,"
so that the whole sentence reads:

"Except for an assumed-rank array, the rank of a named array, once
declared, is constant; the extents may be constant or may vary during
execution."

This is a new edit proposed by JOR as a result of the question posed
in 16-194.

[39:33 2.4.7p6] Insert "(6.6)" after "image index".

But do not insert "(6.6)" after "coindexed object".  This is not needed
because "coindexed object" is hyperlinked.

[41:3 2.5.1p1] Insert "structure component," before "named constant".

[41:19 2.5.4p1] Replace "Association" with "Name association (16.5.1)".

[41:20+ 2.5.4p1+] Insert a paragraph:

"Pointer association (16.5.2) between a pointer and a target allows the
target to be referenced by a reference to the pointer."

[41:21 2.5.4p2] Replace "Also, storage association" with "Storage
association (16.5.3)".

[41:21+ 2.5.4p2+] Insert a paragraph:

"Inheritance association (16.5.4)" occurs between components of the
parent component and components inherited by type extension."

[42:3+2 NOTE 2.14] Add after the first sentence: "If it does, 2.3.7
states that a program unit that is defined by means other than Fortran
and that initiates normal termination is required to include the effect
of executing the C \cf{exit()} function."

This is alternative wording proposed by JOR.

2. Edits Rejected by JOR, with comments
=======================================

[32:38 2.2.3p1] Insert a comma before "which".
JOR does not believe that the comma is necessary.

[36:4 2.3.7p4] Delete "the" before "execution".

The edit should be to [36:3 2.3.6p4].  Both "during execution" and
"during the execution" are used extensively.  JOR prefers to leave
this edit to editor's discretion.

[36:16-18 2.3.7p2] Replace "a companion processor" by "means other than
Fortran" twice because processors don't define procedures.

JOR thinks processors can define procedures.

[37:20 2.4.3.1p2] Delete "the" before "execution".

As for [36:4 2.3.7p4]

[42:3+2 NOTE 2.14] Replace "A" with "Other than the requirement in 2.3.7
that a program unit that is defined by means other than Fortran and that
initiates normal termination is required to include the effect of
executing the C \cf{exit()} function, a"

JOR proposes alternative wording above.
