1. Introduction

The /EDIT subgroup has spotted some infelicities in the edits passed from
paper 00-270 (Overloading Structure Constructors).  This paper provides
corrections for those edits.

2. Edits

In the edit for [55:24+], after "<component-spec-list>" replace the rest of
the constraint by
  "shall not be a valid <actual-arg-spec-list> for a function reference that
   is resolvable as a generic reference (14.1.2.4.1)".

Replace the text in the edit for [254:13+] with
  "Constraint: If <function-name> is a generic name, the <function-reference>
               shall be resolvable as a generic reference (14.1.2.4.1)."

In the edit for [419:11+] insert
  "A generic name may be the same as a type name.  This can be used to emulate
   user-defined structure constructors for that type, even if the type has
   private components.  For example:"
between the title and the first example.

In the edit for [419:11+] change
  "The same syntax is used if a type has type parameters.  For example:"
to
  "The type name may still be used as a generic name if the type has type
   parameters.  For example:"

In the edit for [419:11+] insert
  "  y = t(kind(0d0))((0,1))    ! Uses the structure constructor for type t"
immediately before the final END statement.
