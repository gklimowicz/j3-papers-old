Subject:    Confusing wording about WHERE mask-expr in 7.2.3.1p2
Reference:  16-007
Date: 2016 January 15

1. Introduction
===============

In 7.2.3.1p2 we read

"If a where-construct contains a where-stmt, a masked-elsewhere-stmt,
or another where-construct then each mask-expr within the
where-construct shall have the same shape."

To which where-construct does "the same shape" apply?  The outer one,
the inner one, or both?  The same shape as what?

From the discussion of control masks in 7.2.3.2, it appears to be
both.  It could be more clearly written.

2. Edits
========

[166:6-7 7.2.3.1p2] Replace the first sentence, viz. "If a
where-construct contains ... have the same shape." with one of the
following:

"If a where-construct contains more than one mask-expr, each mask-expr
within that where-construct shall have the same shape."

        or

"Each mask-expr that appears within a particular where-construct shall
have the same shape."
