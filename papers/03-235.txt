Subject: Unintended Editorial Effect?                   J3/03-235
From: Kurt W. Hirchert                  (Meeting 165) 14 Aug 2003

The insertion of the word "scalar" into what is now line 14 on
page 59 of 03-007 appears to have been proposed as a purely
editorial change, but the effect is to make it appear that the
parent component exists only in scalar objects.  I do not believe
such a technical change was intended.

[This change came from 02-332 by way of 03-107, but neither
document explains _why_ this change was to be made.]

1.  59:14 Remove the first occurrence of the word "scalar".
     {* This simply undoes the change, but that my not address
     the original reason for the change. *}

Alternative:

1.  59:14 Replace "A scalar object of" with "An".
     {* This makes the parent component a part of the extended
     type rather than just a part of objects of that extended
     type.  That seems to me to be the right thing to say, but
     it is a more drastic change, so I offer it only as an
     alternative. *}
