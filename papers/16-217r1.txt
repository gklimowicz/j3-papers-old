Subject:   Editorial: EXTERNAL in INTERFACE body
Date: 2016 June 09


Consider the following code.

program main
  real ext, inval
  interface
    function ext1 (y)
      real ext1, y
      external ext1
    end function ext1 ! Duplicate EXTERNAL attribute?
  end interface
  inval = 1.0
  print *, ext1(inval)
end program main

The EXTERNAL statement is allowed inside an interface body.  However,
although there is a constraint

    C542 In an external subprogram, the EXTERNAL attribute shall not be
         specified for a procedure defined by the subprogram.

there is no constraint against this being done in an interface body.
There are no semantics provided for this so it cannot be standard
conforming, but this should be clearly stated.

EDITS to 16-007r1:

[99:28+] 5.5.9 EXTERNAL attribute, after C542, add new constraint
  "C542a In an interface body, the EXTERNAL attribute shall not be
         specified for the procedure declared by the interface body."
