Subject: Fortran 2008 Compatibility
Date: 2017 June 27

Reference: 17-007r1

Subclause 4.3.3 describes compatibility of Fortran 2015 with Fortran
2008. Paragraph 1 begins:

"Except as identified in this subclause, this document is an upward
compatible extension to the preceding Fortran International Standard,
ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 (Fortran 2008)."

Later paragraphs list such exceptions. Paragraph 1 then continues:

"Except for the deleted features noted in Annex B.2, any standard-
conforming Fortran 2008 program remains standard-conforming under
this document."

This is inconsistent with what came before, as it says that as long as
a Fortran 2008 program doesn't use any deleted features, it is still
standard-conforming, ignoring the changes described in following
paragraphs, some of which make a previously conforming program no
longer conforming.

Edit
----

30:21-23, 4.3.3p1 (Fortran 2008 compatibility)

Replace the paragraph:

"Except as identified in this subclause, this document is an upward
compatible extension to the preceding Fortran International Standard,
ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 (Fortran 2008). Except for the deleted features
noted in Annex B.2, any standard-conforming Fortran 2008 program
remains standard-conforming under this document."

with:

"Except as identified in this subclause, and except for the deleted
features noted in Annex B.2, this document is an upward compatible
extension to the preceding Fortran International Standard,
ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 (Fortran 2008). Any standard-conforming Fortran
2008 program that does not use any deleted features, and does not use
any feature identified in this subclause as being no longer permitted,
remains standard-conforming under this document."
