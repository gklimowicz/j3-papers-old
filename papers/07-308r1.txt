Subject:     Simplify the term user-defined derived-type input/output
Date: 2007 November 13

We should simplify the references to UDDTIO.  Essentially everyplace
it is referred to as "user-defined derived-type input/output.  The
related concepts of assignment and operations are simply referred to
as defined assignment or defined operations.  No need for a
"user-defined" or any other adjectives.

If we simplify the name, it will also remove editorial oddities.
For example, the heading to 9.6.4.7.2 is "Executing user-defined
derived-type input/output data transfers", yet the next sentence
refers a "derived-type input/output procedure".  It will also make
the name somewhat more meaningful.  There's no particular reason
why the I/O is "user-defined".  A processor that provides
some sort of intrinsic derived type might also provide I/O using
the UDDTIO mechanism.


Purely editorial proposals.
Replace all instances of "user-defined derived-type input/output",
"derived-type input/output", or " user-defined input/output" with
"defined input/output" where, in the editors opinion, it makes sense
to do so.


Don't make the change in 9.6.4.7.1.  Instead, add at the end of
the sentence on page 236, line 33 add:
"The process is referred to as <<defined input/output>>."

Add "defined input/output", "defined assignment", and 
"defined operations" to the chapter 2 terms list.
