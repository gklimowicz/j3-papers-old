Subject:  Missing items from clause 19.6 Definition and
          undefinition of variables
Date: 2017 October 16

Discussion
----------

Section 19.6.3 Variables that are initially defined does not
cover EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE or TEAM_TYPE variables, or derived
types which are fully default initialized.

Section 19.6.5 Events that cause variables to become defined
does not mention the team variable specified in a FORM TEAM
statement gets defined if the FORM TEAM is successful.

Subgroup Response
-----------------

19.6.1p4 already covers a derived type variable where "all of its
nonpointer components are defined." Therefore, no edit is needed
for this concern. Note, however, that an EVENT_TYPE or TEAM_TYPE
variable could have allocatable components, which cannot be default
initialized.

Subgroup agrees that 19.6.5 needs the additional item.

Edit to 17-007r2
----------------

[530:10+] In 19.6.5 Events that cause a variable to become
defined add "(34+) Successful execution of a FORM TEAM
statement causes the team variable to become defined.".
