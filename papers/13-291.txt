~~~~~~~~~~~

It is desired to assign specific index numbers to images of a subteam.
For example, it allows users replacing an failed image in the current
team with a spare image and assign the same image index number as the
failed image to it.

[10:18] Replacing R505 with the following:

"R505 <form-subteam-stmt> is FORM SUBTEAM (<subteam-id>, <team-variable>
[,<image-index>] [,<sync-stat-list>])

[10:19] Insert the following after line 19

"R507 <image-index>          is <scalar-integer-expr>"

[10:22] At the end of line 22, insert the following:

"The value of <image-index> specifies the index of the executing image
in the subteam specifed by <subteam-id>.  It shall be a positive
number and less or equal to the number of images in the subteam. Each
image in a subteam shall have a unique index."
