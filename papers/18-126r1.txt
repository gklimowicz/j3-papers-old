Introduction
------------
In formatted output of strings, it is common to want to remove
 trailing blanks from the string before output. This results in
I/O lists being cluttered with multiple occurences of
TRIM(value).

Currently, an A edit descriptor with a width of zero is not
permitted (C1306). This paper proposes to define A0 as indicating
that trailing blanks shall be removed from the string
before output. A0 is not to be permitted on input.

In the case of G0, the standard currently states "follow the rules
for the A edit descriptor with no field width." Changing this to
be A0 would be an incompatibility with Fortran 2018, but it is
probably a behavior change most users would find desirable.

Straw vote: Should G0 change incompatibly to the new A0 behavior
on output? Yes/No

Note: the original version of this paper suggested trimming leading
blanks as well. J3 Plenary disapproved of that, but approved moving
forward (7-0-6) on the proposal with trailing blanks only removed.
