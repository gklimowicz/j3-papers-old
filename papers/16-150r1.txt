Subject: comments in clause 9
Date: 2016 February 09

Reference: 16-007

Following the discussion Tuesday morning, subgroup decided
to take one issue from 16-150 and give it further action.

This is a proposed edit in clause 9.

[210:9-10] 9.5.1 says that an external unit identified
by the same integer value is the same unit throughout the program.

Surely, the intention is per image, not per program.

[210:10] change "program" to "image"

{state correct scope of external unit values}
