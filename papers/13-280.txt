Subject: INTENT(IN) argument in ATOMIC intrinsics in TS 18508
References : N1967, 10-007r1, 13-272r1

Discussion:
-----------

Evaluation of the INTENT(IN) arguments to atomic subroutines are not
part of the atomic action executed by the subroutine.  An edit is
provided for this.


Edit to N1967:
--------------

The Edits section of paper 13-272r1 contains this sentence twice:

"For invocation of an atomic subroutine with an argument OLD, the
assignment of the value to OLD is not part of the atomic action."

Append after each instance of this sentence:

"For invocation of an atomic subroutine, evaluation of an INTENT(IN)
argument is not part of the atomic action."
