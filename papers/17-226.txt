Subject: usage error in list

1. Discussion

Item (1) in the list of classes of entities [514:4] (19.3.1 Classes
of local identifiers) contains a usage error some texts call a
"comma splice".  The usual fix for a comma splice is to replace a
comma with a colon or semicolon.  In this case, because the comma
that should be replaced precedes a list, I prefer to use a colon.
Some usage texts prefer the semicolon even in this case.

The entire paragraph could use a rewrite, but I am not proposing to
do one.

An edit is provided.

2. Edit to 17-007r2

[514:4] 19.3.1 Classes of local identifiers, p1
        Replace "entities (19.4), named variables" with
"entities (19.4):  named variables".
