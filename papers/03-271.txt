This paper explains the actions proposed on the subject papers.

  Wordsmithing.  Some cases are probably improvements in wording,
  but none are necessary.  Several are for things unchanged since
  f95 or even f90.  In some cases, the improvement is arguable or
  introduces inconsistencies elsewhere.

  [4:5],[78] - Grammatical changes that are arguable (or wrong).

  [72] - already adequately covered.  Unchanged from f90/f95.

  [77],[85] - already adequately covered.

  [161] Value part is a spec change for something that isn't
  broken.  Allocation status part is already covered in 16.4.1.5.
  (Association is established when executing the associate
  statement and remains associated throughout execution of the
  block; that precludes deallocation.)

  [411] This question is answered in Note 16.8 on the same page;
  it is hard to imagine a more explicit or direct statement than
  that note.  However, the normative text at [411:5] does appear
  to contradict the note, so a fix is proposed for that.

  [423] yes (do the first fix).

  [14],[75],[269],[277],[453].[486] - yes

03-262
  Yes.  A minority of subgroup disagreed with this recommendation.

  Also, C438 could be more simply stated and C439 could
  just be deleted, but we don't propose those changes now.

03-263
  This is not adequate reason for a change.  However, see
  03-267, which proposes the same change for a different reason.

03-265
  Yes.

03-267
  Part 4 and the edit on [347] are unnecessary spec changes.
  The edit on 348 is unnecessary.  We could add arbitrary
  amounts of extra explanatory material; this does not correct
  an error.

  [162:20+] Agree that this corrects an error, though slightly
  diffferent wording is proposed.
