Subject:    Connecting more than one unit to a file
Date: 2015 October 30
References: 15-226

1. Introduction
===============

Subclause 9.5.4, paragraph 4, says "It is processor dependent whether a
file can be connected to more than one unit at the same time."

Subclause 9.5.6.1, paragraph 8, says "If a file is already connected to
a unit, an OPEN statement on that file with a different unit shall not
be executed."

Annex A.2 says it is processor dependent "whether a file can be
connected to more than one unit at the same time", and refers to
subclause 9.5.4.

Which one is it?

Since the permission in 9.5.4p4 is new, it appears that the intent is
that whether connecting more than one unit to a single file is allowed
is to become processor dependent rather than prohibited.

2. Edits
========

[208:32 9.5.6.1p8] To avoid a future interp, replace the paragraph:

"If a file is already connected to a unit, it is processor dependent
whether an OPEN statement for that file with a different unit may be
executed."
