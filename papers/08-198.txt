Subject: When are cobounds of a coarray in a BLOCK evaluated?
Date: 2008 May 20
References: 08-007r2, 185-wvs-002

1.  Introduction

5.3.6.3p3 doesn't say anything about evaluating cobounds when a BLOCK is
executed.

Instead of tackling this in 5.3.6.3, the relationship between
specification expressions and length parameters of automatic objects in
5.2.2p2, and the relationship between bounds and specification
expressions in 5.3.8.2p2, it would be better to do it once and for all
in 7.1.11.

2.  Edits

This is also done in 08-197, which would supercede these, so don't do
these if 08-197 is adopted.

Editor: Delete [86:5.2.2p2].

Editor: Delete [90-91:5.3.6.3p3].

Editor: Delete [92:53.8.2p2].

Editor: Insert a new paragraph after [149:7.1.11p9]:

"Specification expressions are evaluated when the procedure defined by
the subprogram in which they appear is invoked, or when the block in
which they appear is executed.  The value of a specification expression,
and hence of a bound, cobound or length parameter defined by the value
of the expression, is not changed by execution of executable constructs
within the subprogram or block."
