1. Discussion

7.2.1.2p1(6) [09-007r1:155:17] requires that <expr> and <variable> have
the same rank if <variable> is polymorphic.  This is because the
processor might have to reallocate <variable> if <expr> has shape,
type, or length parameters, that are different from those of <variable>.

Given that 7.2.1.3p3 [156:10] requires that <expr> and <variable> have
the same rank if <variable> is allocatable (which it has to be if it's
polymorphic) and not allocated, and that if <variable> is allocated it
is allocated with the same type, type parameters and shape as <expr>,
there is no technical problem that is solved by always requiring the
same rank in the polymorphic case.  The requirement that they have the
same rank if <variable> is allocatable and not allocated is sufficient.

[09-007r1:155:17 7.2.1.2p1(6)]------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete "and have the same rank".

This interacts with 09-178r1.  If 09-178r1 passes, the appropriate
change should be made there.
