Subject: INITIAL Procedures


Initial procedures were considered for Fortran 2003,
but were dropped so that J3 could pursue other features.
I propose that initial procedures be part of the next standard.

Title: INITIAL Procedures

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: J3/97-256

Basic Functionality: An initial procedure s a type bound procedure
                     that executes automatically when a variable
                     of that type comes into existance.

Rationale:  When an object of derived type appears, it may need
            some initial values, such as having components allocated,
            or having pointers set so it fits into a linked list,
            b-tree, or other data organization.  Initial procedures
            constitute a scheme for doing so.

Estimated Impact: The impact of initial procedures may be substantial,
                  but compilers already implement initial procedures
                  (often called "constructors") in many other languages,
                  so techniques for doing so must be well known.

Detailed Specification: Paper J3/97-256 is the most recent specification
                        I can find in the J3 archive.  I do not
                        know that it's specifications are up-to-date
                        for the current Fortran 2003, but I will not
                        attempt to improve upon them.
