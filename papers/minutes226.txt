      2. INCITS PL22 Action Item #0142: Request for INCITS/PL22 committee
             charter/scope review and vote (due Mar 3, 2022)
         1. Reference URL: 
            https://standards.incits.org/apps/org/workgroup/pl22/
                    members/action_item.php?action_item_id=17531
         2. Reference URL: https://www.incits.org/committees/pl22.

   3. International Items
      1. A couple of minutes to discuss process of ISO certification
           of a new language
         Towards the end of Dec, the working draft was registered as a
         committee draft, which started formal process.  Now that CD has
         been registered, first an action item to collect comments and
         positions from US body, whether it should move next stage as
         DIS, or Draft International Standard.
         Next, letter ballot which passed.  US National body approved the
         CD onto next stage.
         What changes is that it is no longer just the action of PL22.3,
         there are country votes now.  Voting time is relatively
         long.  If we move onto DIS, the first vote is to approvate as
         final published standard.  If no tech changes, goes to FDIS, 
         Final Draft International Standard, where it must address all
         comments from all coountries.
         Can be "Agreed", or "No, this is how it's supposed to be". 
         This will be iterative.

   ** Motion "PL22.3 construct one last corrigendum to 2018 that contains
              anything passed thru this meeting, and passed letter ballot
              with J3 and WG5."  (Cohen/Klimowicz)  UC

   2. Administrative
      1. Closing business - B. Friesen
         Nothing for now
      2. Future meetings - B. Friesen
         Some of the uncertainty is fading away.  Meeting m227 will be
         held with WG5 and will be hybrid.

         Harder to predict m228.  Travel restrictions are starting to
          fade, but would like to consider hybrid or even fully remote.
          May not be able to find a neutral location this calendar year.

      3. Ending Treasurer's report -  J. Steidel

      4. Closing membership report - L. Menard
          

   3. Comments from members
      No additional comments

   4. Action items.
        - J3 letter ballot #39 is started, will go out in email.
          Vote before 4/10, hard stop.
        - 007r1 will be updated/produced, well in advance of the
          WG5 meeting.
