Subject: Statement and construct entities, local identifiers

1. Discussion

1.3.141.1 says a local variable is a variable in a scoping unit or
BLOCK construct.  Nothing about statement entities.

16.1 says a local identifier has a scope of a scoping unit -- nothing
about constructs or statements.

16.3.1 says that within a scoping unit the identifier of a variable that
is not a statement or construct entity is a local identifier of the
scoping unit.

16.4 says a statement or construct entity has a scope of a statement or
construct.

Thus a construct entity that is a variable is a local variable, but its
name is not a local identifier, and a statement entity that is a
variable is not a local variable and its name is not a local identifier.

2. Edits

[20:41-42 1.3.141.1]----------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "or BLOCK construct" with ", BLOCK construct, or
statement".  Replace "or construct" by ", construct, or statement".

[443:6 16.1p1]----------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the "local identifier" list item:

  "o The scope of a local identifier that is the identifier of a
     statement or construct entity is defined in 16.4.  The scope of a
     local identifier that is not the identifier of a statement or
     construct entity is a scoping unit (2.2)."
