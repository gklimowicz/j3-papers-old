To: J3
From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Editor's report for 16-007r1
Date: 2016 May 01


1. Introduction

This is the editor's report for applying the papers from meeting 209 to
produce 16-007r1.  There is a separate report for applying the rest of the
coarray TS, which is also included in 16-007r1.

I note that I exceeded my editorial licence and made a couple of technical
changes, clearly marked below as TECHNICAL CHANGE.  These need to be
reviewed (and reversed if the committee disagrees with the changes).


2. Papers and results

16-106r2:
  [181:1] Deleted unwanted "(if any)", twice.
          "bounds" -> "rank" ("bounds" is usually wrong for pointers).
          Did not make any new paragraph to keep the structure simpler.
  [various] Did a lot of wordsmithing.
  TECHNICAL CHANGE: Syntactic requirements put into C820 which is where
                    the other syntactic requirements were.
  NOTE: A PROTECTED outside variable is allowed in LOCAL/LOCAL_INIT only
        in the module where it is defined.  I did not change this.
  EXTRA EDIT: Deleted [181:10-11] as it is now impossible.
  EXTRA EDIT: Deleted [78:28-29] as it is now impossible.
  Deleted UTI 015.
Done.

16-107:
  EXTRA EDIT: Changed hyperlinking of "obsolescent" for label form of DO
              stmt from B.3 to B.3.10.
Done.

16-108:
  EXTRA EDIT: [26:20] 1.6.5p3 "be automatic"
                      -> "be an automatic data object", hyperlinked.
              [26:38] 1.6.6p5 ditto.
Done.

16-109r1:
  EXTRA EDIT: For the term "construct association", also added the CHANGE
              TEAM construct (should have been done as part of the TS
              integration, but I did not notice it at that time).
  COMMENT: Some of the wording would be improved if we changed CHANGE TEAM
           from a "coselector" to a "selector" (as in, significantly
           simplified).
Done.

16-110r1:
  EXTRA EDIT: [35:20] Reworded that item and surrounding items from plural
                      to singular, in accordance with the ISO directives.
Done.

16-112r1:
  NOT DONE: [78:28] because I deleted the paragraph affected by this
                    earlier, since we now prohibit this case.
Done.

16-113r1:
  In retrospect moving the constraint from c12 to c05 is merely moving it
  from one place where it sort-of belongs but no-one will ever find it, to
  another place where it sort-of belongs but no-one will ever find it.
  COMMENT: Perhaps it, along with other interoperability-related
           constraints and requirements, should be in c15?  I don't feel
           very inclined to reorganise this right now though.
Done.

16-115r1:
Done.

16-116r1:
Done.

16-119r1:
Done.

16-120r3:
  [509:8+] Did at [509:18+] which is where it belongs.
Done.

16-122r2:
  [intro] Totally rewrote in the style of what we did for RECL=.
Done.

16-129r2:
Done.

16-130r1:
  [367:36-40] First two edits are instead
              "is set to the length of that value"
              ->"is assigned the value of its length",
              "is set to 0" -> "is assigned the value zero".
  [389:17] "If FROM is not the same variable as TO and"
           ->"Then, if FROM"
           to avoid saying anything about FROM and TO being the same
           variable, since this is not actually permitted except when
           that variable is unallocated.  (If we wanted to give licence
           for the variable being allocated, we would need to give that
           licence explicitly.)
Done.

16-132r2:
Done.

16-134r1:
  [356:7,11,15] "the value" -> "this value", to avoid possible
                contradiction with the following sentence which
                specifies assigning blanks when there is no clock.
Done.

16-135:
Done.

16-139r1:
  EXTRA EDITS:
    [423:2] "14.1 General" -> "14.1 Overview of IEEE arithmetic support",
            to improve the subtitle now we are linking to it.
    [423:4] After "*" insert ".", to properly terminate the sentence.
  EDIT:
    [511:36+] Completely rewrote the first bullet point to more accurately
              say what the processor dependency is (viz which IEEE op).
Done.

16-140r2:
  [431:4] After "impure" inserted "unless otherwise stated",
          because several subroutines are in fact pure.
Done.

16-142r2:
  [457:19] Please NEVER say something like
                      Replace "and" with a comma.
           Please always give more context.
    As it happens, as best as I could tell, neither of the two "and"s on
    that line should be replaced by commas anyway.  So I added the extra
    phrase and rewrote to make it grammatical.
  [460:47] Rejected.  "when" is correct here, and "where" sounds very odd.
  [464:0+17 NOTE 15.7] DELETED the note instead, as editing to make it
                       vacuously true would be silly.
  [485:20 15.10.4p2] REJECTED.  This is badly placed and the reader will
                     have no clue what you are trying to convey.  Either
                     a remark "with the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute" (no xref
                     needed) in the first sentence of the first para, or
                     the NOTE suggested in 16-142.  I went with the remark
                     which seems totally adequate.
Done.

16-144r1:
  [497:32 16.5.2.7p1] EXTRA EDIT
                      "the definition status of the pointer" -> "it";
                      otherwise we're saying the definition status is
                      defined or becomes undefined, not the pointer.
  COMMENT: This is partly duplicative of the text in "General".
  [502:2 16.6.4p1] "other than those that are" -> "that are not".
Done.

16-147r2:
  [510:1] Also "from the input item" -> "from that of the input item"
          otherwise we're comparing type&tp with an input item itself.
Done.

16-148r1:
Done.

16-149r1:
  [533:14] Instead, "a prior OPEN"
           ->"prior execution of an OPEN statement".
Done.

16-150r2:
Done.

16-154r1:
Done.

16-157r1:
  Deleted UTI 013 and 014.
Done.

16-159r2:
Done.

16-160r1:
  EXTRA: Also increased the height of the headings so that the text is not
         right up against the top and bottom lines of the frame.
Done.

16-162r1:
  [xvi] This interacted with an edit in another paper.  Reworded.
Done.

16-163r1:
Done.

16-164r1:
  TECHNICAL CHANGE: I made the requirement into a compile-time one instead
                    of a runtime one.  I also simplified the wording.
                    If we really wanted this to be a runtime error,
                    it will need to be changed.
Done.

16-165r1:
Done.

16-166r1:
  [494:9-12] Fixed typo in edit "RANK"->"TYPE".
Done.

16-167:
  [133:12] "and nonoptional" -> "nonoptional".
Done.
