347:4 Did the co-array team think about a CO_FINDLOC?

The following 3 comments apply to all of the collective subroutines.
362:1 Can the RESULT variable also be a CO_ARRAY? I think
so, but it sounds odd to me.

362:1 Does the issuing image have to be in the team? If I'm
in the earth team, can I collect stuff from the air or
water team? If so, whom syncs with whom?

362:1 What is the result if team is NULL_IMAGE_TEAM?

364:19 I don't believe that MINLOC and MAXLOC cover the case of
a zero length character string.

367:3 This appears to allow "n" as a value for DIM, but the result
and case(ii) example use "n-1". Which should it be. In
a way, "n" is OK, since the actual array size is known
to the processor (I think).

376:16 Is there anything special (force a sync, prohibit,...)
that needs to be done to EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE if it
executes on different images?

377:6 EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE also causes a termination. Does the
new STOP, etc., text cover this case also?

380:2 The intro text [339:16] says that collective subroutines do an
implicit sync before starting execution. That's before the
team has formed in this case. Should it not be a collective
subroutine? Or should it be special cased about the initial
sync?

380:7 The teams are only equal if there is an even number of images.
EDIT: delete "equal "

430:7+ I believe co_array must be allocatede, etc.
EDIT: after "of any type." add " It shall not be an unallocated
allocatable or a pointer which is not associated."
