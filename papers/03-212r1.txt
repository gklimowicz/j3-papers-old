Re:  WG5/N1553

J3 responses to WG5 paper N1553

                               ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5 N1553

              Report I from subgroup Chapter 8 onwards

Paper N1539

As per WG5 recommendation, no action taken on N1539

WG5 subgroup is of the opinion that there is no overriding
reason for this technical change at a moment when
no technical changes should be made.  The issue could
be reargued for the next standard.  The constants will
be superfluous then, but that's acceptable.  Moreover,
the objective set out in the first paragraph is not
achieved ("inquire about the size of any storage unit
defined by the standard").

Paper N1543

WG5 comments processed by J3/03-205R1

Paper N1530

Recommendation accepted as is, no action required by J3.

Paper N1532

Subgroup recommends the following edits instead of the ones given in
N1532 and J3/03-212 to improve interoperability with C:

228:30, Replace "The" with "When the input field is not an IEEE exceptional
specification(10.6.1.2.1), the

230:17  "consists either of" change to "consists of optional blanks,
followed by either of"

230:20  Change "." to "," and insert a new line with no indentation
"optionally followed by blanks."

230:19 Replace "a processor dependent number of nonblank characters" by
"zero or more alphanumeric characters".

230:23-25.  Change the last sentence to read:

"The NaN value is a quiet NaN if the only nonblank characters in the
field are 'NAN' or 'NAN()', otherwise, the NaN value is processor-dependent."
