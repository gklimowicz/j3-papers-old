[175:40 8.1.6.4p2]------------------------------------------------------
A procedure cannot return into the <do-body> of a DO construct (because
a return is a transfer of control).

Editor:
Replace "Transfer of control" by "Branching".

Reason: Branching is defined (8.2.1) as a transfer of control to a
labeled statement. That is what we are talking about here.
