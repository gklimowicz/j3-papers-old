Issue 226: [69:15-22]

1. Analysis

The paragraph preceding the J3 internal note has to be adapted, because, as it stands, it does not allow data entities with the BIND(C) attribute, which are declared in different scoping units with reference to the same name, to be the same.

The J3 internal note mentions the option of either fixing or deleting
the paragraph. Deleting the paragraph is an option, because the restriction, described in the paragraph, is implicit in section 4.5.2. An advantage of deleting the paragraph, is that it decreases the possibility of introducing bugs in further changes to the standard, because one functionality is not described in multiple places in the standard.
