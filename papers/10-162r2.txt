NUMBER: F08/0015
TITLE: IMPLICIT
KEYWORDS: IMPLICIT
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

5.5 IMPLICIT statement contains the permission-giving statement:

    "The mapping may be to a derived type that is inaccessible in the
     local scope if the derived type is accessible to the host scope."

But what if the derived type is not accessible to the host scope?

Consider the module:

  module m
    implicit type(t) (a-z)
    type t
      real x
    end type
  contains
    subroutine s(x)
      type t
        character(10) c
      end type
      call inner(x)
    contains
      subroutine inner(y)
        a = x
        b = y
        print *,a%x,b%x
      end subroutine
    end subroutine
  end module

In inner, the mapping is not to a derived type that is accessible to
the host scope.

Is this module standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes.  The statement apparently giving permission is in error: no
permission needs to be given here, it simply follows from the other
scoping rules.

An edit is provided to clarify the standard.

EDITS to 10-007:

[109:21-22] (5.5p4)
  Delete the confusing sentence "The mapping may ... scoping unit.".
