1. Discussion

See 11-202.


2. Differences from 11-202

Changed "termination" to "completion".

Changed duration of pending asynchronous communcation status to be from the
initiation procedure until the completion procedure, this excludes C
routines executed before the initiation and after the completion.

3. Edits to WG5/N1854

Note that the text for each edit is delimited by `` and '', and the
" character is used internally for quoting in the TR.

[4:28+] After NOTE 2.4, add new section

``2.4 ASYNCHRONOUS attribute

  2.4.1 Introduction

  The ASYNCHRONOUS attribute is extended to apply to variables that are
  used for asynchronous communication initiated and terminated by
  procedures written in C.

  2.4.2 Asynchronous communication

  Asynchronous communication for a Fortran variable occurs through the
  action of procedures defined by means other than Fortran.  It is
  initiated by execution of an asynchronous communication initiation
  procedure and completed by execution of an asynchronous communication
  completion procedure.  Between the execution of the initiation and
  completion procedures, any variable of which any part is associated with
  any part of the asynchronous communication variable is a pending
  communication affector.  Whether a procedure is an asynchronous
  communication initiation or completion procedure is processor dependent.

  Asynchronous communication is either input communication or output
  communication. For input communication, a pending communication affector
  shall not be referenced, become defined, become undefined, become
  associated with a dummy argument that has the VALUE attribute, or have
  its pointer association status changed. For output communication, a
  pending communication affector shall not be redefined, become undefined,
  or have its pointer association status changed.''

[24:23+] Add new edit
``In 5.3.4 ASYNCHRONOUS attribute, at the end of paragraph 1, insert
    "or asynchronous communication (15.5.4)"
  and at the end of paragraph 2, insert
    "or a pending communication affector (15.5.4)".''

[28:37+] Add new edit
``Insert subclause 2.4.2 of this Technical Report as subclause 15.5.4
  at the end of the existing subclause 15.5.''

[28:37++] Insert new subclause
``6.9a Edits to annex A

  Insert new bullet point at the end of the list, changing the
  previously-final full stop to a semicolon,
    "- whether a procedure defined by means other than Fortran is an
       asynchronous communication initiation or completion procedure.''
