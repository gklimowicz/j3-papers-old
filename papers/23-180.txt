There has been occasional confusion among users that some of the 
examples of numerical inquiry intrinsics do not show the result
expected on processors supporting IEEE floating point. A note
pointing this out should be added to 16.4 (Numeric models) of the
form:

"The integer and real models do not necessarily reflect any 
processor's implementation. In particular, the real model is not 
the same as \theIEEEstd."
