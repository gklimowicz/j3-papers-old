Subject: Scope of function results
Date: 2017 February 10


1. Introduction

It has been pointed out that the entire contents of subclause 19.3.3
Function results, in 19.3 Local identifiers, in clause 19 Scope,
association and definition, is completely redundant, not saying anything
more than is already said in the first few sentences of paragraph 4 of
subclause 15.6.2.2 Function subprogram ([331:29-32]).  It does not say
anything about the name of a function result being a local identifier,
which one might have expected.

Either this could be deleted, or trimmed and something interesting said
about the scoping.  Since 19.3.3 is referred to by 19.3.1p2, final bullet,
it would seem better to enhance it.


2. Edits to 17-007

[515:17-19] 19.3.3 Function results, p1, replace the second sentence of
            the subclause "If there is no RESULT... RESULT clause.", with
  "A function result is either a variable or a procedure pointer, and thus
   the name of a function result is a local identifier of class (1)."
{Delete the duplicative stuff about what name the function result has, and
 add a statement that it is a local variable.}

ALTERNATIVE:
[514:18] 19.3.1 Classes of local identifiers, p2,
         after "its defining subprogram"
         change cross-reference "(19.3.3)"
         to "(15.6.2.2)"
         (the title of 15.6.2.2 is "Function subprogram").
{Change the reference to where it arguably ought to be.}

[515:16-19] 19.3.3 Function results, delete entire subclause.
{Delete unnecessary redundancy.}
