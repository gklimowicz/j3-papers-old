Subject:    Clause 3; Allow null string in macro assignment
Date: 2007 February 06
References: J3/07-007

The text at 35:32-33 and 40:36 clearly allows the use of null tokens
in the new macro assignment feature.  But, the syntax rules for
macro-token-assignment-statement (R336) forbid it.

[37:1] delete the first "result-token" so that the rule becomes
R336    assignment-tok-sequence    is     [result-token] ... [&&]
