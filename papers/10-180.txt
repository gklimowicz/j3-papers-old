QUESTION:

Consider the program

Program example
  Integer :: x(3) = (/ 1,2,3 /)
  Print 1,x
1 Format(1x,999999999('a',I0,'b'))
  Print 2,x
2 Format(1x,*('a',I0,'b'))
  Print 3,x
3 Format(1x,999999999('a',:,',',I0,'b'))
  Print 4,x
4 Format(1x,*('a',:,',',I0,'b'))
End Program

According to the first statement of 10.4p8 [249:12-13],
  "If format control encounters the rightmost parenthesis of a
   complete format specification and another effective item is not
   specified, format control terminates."

This means that the first two lines of output should be
 a1ba2ba3ba
 a1ba2ba3b

and the second two lines of output should be
 a,1ba,2ba,3ba
 a,1ba,2ba,3b

But according to Note 10.7,
  "The effect of an unlimited-format-item is as if its enclosed list
   were preceded by a very large repeat count."
which it manifestly is not.

Is the normative text correct or the note?

ANSWER:

The note is correct.
An edit is supplied to correct the normative text.

EDITS to 10-007:

[249:12] After "complete format specification" insert
  ", format control reversion would be to a parenthesis that is not
   the beginning of an <unlimited-format-item>,"

Making the whole sentence read
  "If format control encounters the rightmost parenthesis of a
   complete format specification, format control reversion would be to
   a parenthesis that is not the beginning of an
   <unlimited-format-item>, and another effective item is not
   specified, format control terminates."
