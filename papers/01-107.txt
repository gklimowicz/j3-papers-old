Date:         01 January 2001
To:           J3
From:         Jeanne Martin
Subject:      Adjusted Work Plan for Meeting 156

There are 6 meetings before F2000 is to be submitted to WG5 in June of
2002.  Note that there are only 2 meetings left to complete F95
interpretations that contain edits.

J3 should maintain the current committee organization for the next two
meetings saving the last four for integration. There are 53 outstanding
unresolved issues (down 22 from last meeting even with 10 new ones
added).  They have been categorized them into 2 levels for each of the 3
subgroups and the exception TR development body.  The levels are 1)
crucial and 2) can be deferred to integration if necessary.  The numbers
for each group are:

            crucial             deferrable
JOR           8                     6
DATA          6                    11
INTEROP       6                    12
Except. TR    2                     2

[See below for actual issue numbers.]

To meet the deadline, J3 must complete at least the following
assignments for the next 2 meetings or inform WG5 that the date has
slipped:

Meeting 156
Each group must resolve all of its crucial issues and as many of the
deferred issues as time allows.

Meeting 157
Resolve issues arising from the previous meeting, any remaining crucial
unresolved issues and as many of the deferred issues as time allows.

Also during meetings 156 and 157, J3 will be processing interpretations,
concentrating on those that contain edits (somewhat unpredictable at the
outset).  The Interp Subgroup can suggest a categorization of the
interps into those that are crucial and those that can be deferred.  Any
committee member submitting a new interp must include at least one
possible answer.

After meeting 157 (and the 2001 WG5 meeting), the committee is
reconstituted for integration.  There will be 3 subgroups (This seems to
be the optimum number given the committee size and fluctuating
attendance.)  For identification, call the new subgroups A, B, and C.
The document will be divided into 3 Parts (based loosely on number of
pages):

Part 1: Introduction through Section 7
Part 2: Sections 8 through 12
Part 3: Section 13 through Appendix C

Each SG should attempt to resolve any remaining issues in its assigned
section and resolve any inconsistencies, ambiguities, etc. with other
parts of the document.  The assignments are:

Meeting 158                Meeting 159               Meeting 160
SG A     Part 1            SG A     Part 2           SG A     Part 3
SG B     Part 2            SG B     Part 3           SG B     Part 1
SG C     Part 3            SG C     Part 1           SG C     Part 2

Meeting 161
Any remaining issues are resolved.  Everyone proofreads the entire
document.

                               -----

Criteria for selecting which of the unresolved issues are most crucial
for early resolution were:

1) The serious ones that arose from papers at the last meeting, because
the issues should still be fresh in people's minds.
2) Those that only the originating SG has the expertise to handle.
3) Those that need to be resolved in order to straighten out the
terminology, so that nongroup members can help deal with interactions.
4) Topics that give rise to related issues that need to be dealt with
concurrently.

The following are listed in document order per SG.  Page numbers are
from 01-007.
