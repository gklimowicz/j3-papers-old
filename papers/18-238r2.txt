Subject: Minimum-width Character Format

I Introduction

When one combines static-length character variables with the convenience
of A format, one finds trim() around the output list item.



II Use-cases

For a scalar, this is not much more than a nuisance.
For example,

character( 1000) :: buffer
...
write( ..., '( a)') trim( buffer)

But trim() is transformational (since it may change a length).
So it cannot be applied to an array appearing in an output list.
Thus, an implied-do becomes the easiest way forward, as here,

character( 100), dimension( nflags) :: flags
integer :: i
...
write( ..., '( a)') ( trim( flags( i)), i = 1, nflags)

If the character array to be written is supplied by a function reference,
then a new character variable must be used to subscript the elements
for trim().  Thus, a block becomes the easiest way forward, as here,

just_a_trim: block
   character( right_len), dimension( right_size) :: usage_msg
   integer :: i

   usage_msg = options% get_usage_message()

   write( ..., '( a)') ( trim( usage_msg( i)), i = 1, right_size)

end block just_a_trim

While judicious use of allocatable character variables might alleviate
some of the symptoms, a better and broader cure is desirable.

If a minimal-width character format descriptor were available, say A0,
these gyrations would not be necessary.  The effect
of this format descriptor is to trim blanks from the list item prior
to printing.

Note that, with A0, the three write statements above may be written,
write( ..., '( a0)') buffer
write( ..., '( a0)') flags
write( ..., '( a0)') options% get_usage_message()

I take this as an improvement.



III What I have in mind

I propose that an A0 edit descriptor be added.  The effect on output
is to trim before writing.  Like I0, A0 is not allowed on input.

At meeting 215, a straw vote went to trim trailing blanks only.

This proposal changes the behavior of the g0 edit descriptor
for character values.  This should be mentioned in the Introduction.


IV (Rough) Requirements

1. A format descriptor be provided that formats character output
without trailing blanks.
