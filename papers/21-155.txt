Subject: Public Access to PL22.3 (J3) Documents
Date: 2021-June-21

Normally, INCITS committee working documents are not public - at 
least that is INCITS' policy. The INCITS Policies and Procedures
provides a mechanism for a Technical Committee (that's us) to
lift this restriction:

"By a 2/3 vote of the committee, TCs and their subgroups have the 
option, of making all documents available to the public, with the 
following exceptions:
- draft proposed American National Standards (dpANS);
- Confidential liaison reports and confidential documents from liaison 
organizations;
- Documents regarding personnel issues;
- ISO or ISO/IEC JTC 1 documents that are not publicly available; or
- International position documents.

By a 2/3 vote of the committee, a TC and its TGs may rescind its decision 
to utilize public access at any time. TCs and their TGs which choose to 
provide or rescind public access must notify the INCITS Secretariat within 
30 days of their decision.
...
When adopting this public access model, the TC or TG may allow short-term 
guest attendance at committee meetings in order to facilitate the work of 
the committee and to encourage membership growth. The committee shall 
require guest attendees to sign in and to acknowledge they have read the 
INCITS Patent Policy, the INCITS Copyright Policy and the INCITS Antitrust 
Guidelines, and that they agree to follow INCITS policies and procedures. 
For meetings held electronically (such as teleconferences, webinars, etc.) 
a scan or a fax of the sign-in form from the guest prior to the start of 
the meeting shall be provided."

Voting in favor of this paper is to vote to make PL22.3 (J3) documents
public, with exceptions as noted above.
