I suspect this may be passed directly to /Edit.

Below are some suggested edits for the Introduction.

I found one typo.  And theres no mention of TEAMS, which
ought to be mentioned, as it is one of the major items on the 18508.

I suppose TEAMS could be mentioned in the "Execution control" section,
but might be better in the "described by 18508" section.

Edits:

{remove constriction}

xviii, pp2, second bullet, last sentence: delete "constrict"


{add TEAMS to Intro}

xix, pp2 (from pervious page), bullet titled
"Features perviously described by ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015"
before the first sentence of the paragraph, insert
"TEAMS allow a group of images to collaborate among themselves
independently of other images."
