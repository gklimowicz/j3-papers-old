TITLE: Which part of an effective argument becomes undefined?
KEYWORDS: INTENT(OUT), extended type
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The last sentence of paragraph 17 of Clause 12.5.2.4
[294:42-295:2] states

     If the dummy argument is not polymorphic and the type of
     the effective argument is an extension of the type of the
     dummy argument, only the part of the effective argument
     that is of the same type as the dummy argument becomes
     undefined.

The effective argument might have several parts that are of the
same type as the dummy argument.  Should the sentence say that
only the ancestor component of the effective argument that has
the same type as the dummy argument becomes undefined?

A possible edit is to replace the last sentence of paragraph 17
of Clause 12.5.2.4 with

     If the dummy argument is not polymorphic and the type of
     the dummy argument is the type of an ancestor
     component (4.5.7.2) of the effective argument, only that
     component of the effective argument becomes undefined.
