Subject: Interop TR: generic interfaces and assumed-rank
Date: 2011 February 15
Reference: N1838, 11-137


1. Introduction

Generic resolution needs to be modified to take account of assumed-rank
objects (see 11-142 for an example).  This affects TKR compatibility, which
is used twice - once in the definition of distinguishable, and once in
C1215 where it allows disambiguation by TKR-compatible argument count.


2. Edits to N1838

[4:5+] Add new paragraph and indented paragraph
  "The definition of TKR compatible in paragraph 2 of subclause 12.4.3.4.5
   of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 is changed to:

     A dummy argument is type, kind, and rank compatible, or TKR
     compatible, with another dummy argument if the first is type
     compatible with the second, the kind type parameters of the first have
     the same values as the corresponding kind type parameters of the
     second, and both have the same rank or either is assumed-rank."
