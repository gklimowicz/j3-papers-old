   1.1.9 Comments from members

     Zongaro:  This will be my last meeting on J3.  I hadn't
     expected this to come so soon, but circumstances dictate
     that I change jobs within IBM.  Because of recent changes
     in my group, there won't be anyone available to attend at
     least the next couple of meetings.  I'm not sure yet
     whether anyone from IBM will attend in the future, so I
     won't resign the membership yet.

     Van Snyder:  Will this be the first time IBM hasn't had
     representation on J3?

     Zongaro:  I believe so.

     Martin:  Yes.
