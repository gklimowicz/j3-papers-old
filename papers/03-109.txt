Subject:  Genericity of ISO_C_BINDING module procedures

Introduction
------------
There doesn't seem to be any statement for the ISO_C_BINDING 
module procedures that is analogous to that at [363:4] for the
IEEE module procedures.  The statement for the IEEE module
procedures specifies that the procedure names are generic and 
not specific.
 
That the names are generic and not specific prevents the 
procedures from being specified as actual arguments.  This also
seems necessary for the ISO_C_BINDING module procedures.
For C_F_POINTER, the FPTR argument is a pointer of almost any type and
the SHAPE argument could have any kind type parameter value. For C_LOC,
the argument X is not restricted to a single type.

We propose adding an identical statement for the ISO_C_BINDING
module procedures as the one for the IEEE module procedures.


Proposed Edits
--------------
[382:16+] Add a new paragraph:
    "In the detailed descriptions below, procedure names are
    generic and not specific."
