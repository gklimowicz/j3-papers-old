Subject:	Issue 3 and Issue 123

Issue 3 complains of inconsistencies between 9.5.4 and 9.9.
Issue 123 complains of the inappropriateness of the term "ERRMSG".

Question: In section 9.5.4, at 186:24+,
item (7) states "Determine whether an error, end-of-file, or end-of-record
condition has occurred.", and then lists items (8), (9) & (10) as occurring.

In section 9.9, describes processing an error, end-of-file or end-of-record condition
at 206:24 (1) and 206:36 (1) both state "Execution of the input/output statement
terminates."  At 207:7 (2) states "Execution of the input statement terminates."

Plainly, these statements are inconsistent.  Either processing terminates,
or it doesn't.

The proposed solution is to correct 9.5.4 to indicate that if an error, eof or eor
occurs, then io-list processing stops and error, eof, or eor processing continues
as per 9.9, and to correct 9.9 to indicate that io-list processing stops and
error, eof or eor processing continues.

Unresolved issue 123 asks whether the appropriate name of the specifier
for the character variable returned with an informative value is ERRMSG.
I propose that the name be IOMSG, analogous to IOSTAT,
and that the bnf item <iomsg-variable> be added.

ERRMSG and <errmsg-variable> are also used with the ALLOCATE statement.
However, with the io statements, messages other than error messages
may be provided to the program.
