Subject:        Issue #247: Interoperation with ellipsis

Issue #247 says that we should say something about interoperation
with C functions that take a variable argument list; that is,
C functions that have the ellipsis (...) as a formal argument.

/interop recommends that Fortran not interoperate with any C
function that has the ellipsis as a formal parameter. This
has been discussed in several previous meetings and is beyond
the scope of what the subgroup believes can be finished in a
reasonable time.

Edits:

After 392:37 add:

(7) variable arguments as denoted by the ellipsis (...) are not
allowed for the C function.

NOTE 16.xx
The C language allows specification of a C function that
can take a variable number of arguments (C standard 7.15).
This standard does not provide a mechanism for Fortran
procedures to interoperate with such C functions.
