Discussion
----------

The use of ATOMIC_DEFINE, ATOMIC_REF and SYNC MEMORY to implement
spin-wait loops and similar schemes has been superseded by EVENT POST
and EVENT WAIT. Therefore, Note 8.41 is no longer helpful advice and
is best deleted.


EDITS TO 16-007r1
-----------------

[203:22+ to 204:0+]  In 8.6.5 SYNC MEMORY, delete Note 8.41 that starts
"SYNC MEMORY can be used to ...".

[204:0+] In 8.6.5 SYNC MEMORY, at the start of Note 8.42, replace "As a
second example, the" by:

    "SYNC MEMORY can be used to implement specialized schemes for
    segment ordering.  For example, the"

[204:0+] In 8.6.5 SYNC MEMORY, in Note 8.42, indent the source code
lines by 7 spaces.
