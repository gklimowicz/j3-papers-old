Subject: Exit from Any Block


Allowing an EXIT statement to exit from any block
removes one remaining use of goto's; with block names,
it is a clear way to prematurely end block processing.

Title: EXIT from Any Block

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: 

Basic Functionality: Allow an EXIT statement in any block construct.

Rationale:  A program may detect a reason for immediately exiting a block.
            At present, this may be done (without recourse
            to the low-level goto) only from DO blocks.  Extending
            EXIT to IF, SELECT CASE, ASSOCIATE, SELECT TYPE blocks
            would regularize the language at a high level.

Estimated Impact: The estimated impact is low, as EXIT is a synonym
                  for goto, which is already supported.  The target statement
                  is the END <block> statement, which is easily found.

Detailed Specification: Allow EXIT in IF, SELECT CASE, ASSOCIATE & SELECT TYPE
                        blocks, where it functions as a goto to the end block
                        statement.

                        Example:

                        end_case: if( detect_end_case() )then
                           call fixup_part1()
                           if( .not. severe() ) exit end_case
                           call fixup_part2()
                        endif end_case
