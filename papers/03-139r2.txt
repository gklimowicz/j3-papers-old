Subject: Corrections to C.9.6                         J3/03-139r2
From: Kurt W. Hirchert                  (Meeting 164) 02 Apr 2003

Data SG has decided to address US item 2.1 in a different way, but
the example in C.9.6 still needs correcting.

The editor is given license to adjust the line breaks in the multi-
line comments.  (The line breaks that look right in the text format
of this paper appear to create shorter lines than those in the
existing lines of the example in C.9.6.)
