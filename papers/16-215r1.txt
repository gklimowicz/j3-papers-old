Discussion:
-----------

In 2.4.8 Established coarrays, paragraph 1 indicates which coarrays
are established in the initial team.

  A nonallocatable coarray that is not a dummy argument or host
  associated with a dummy argument, and not a local variable of a
  subprogram or BLOCK construct, is established in the initial team.

A nonallocatable coarray that is not a dummy argument must have the
SAVE attribute as per C526 as:

C526 A coarray or an object with a coarray ultimate component shall
be a dummy argument or have the ALLOCATABLE or SAVE attribute.

Edit to J3/16-007r1:
--------------------

[40:2] In 2.4.8 Established coarray, replace paragraph 1 with:
"A nonallocatable coarray with the SAVE attribute is
established in the initial team."
