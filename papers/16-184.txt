There appear to be two possibilities here:

1. Take the view that the only purpose of the KIND argument here is to
allow the user to specify the value selected_int_kind(18).  Integers
of this range were required in F08. No edit is needed.

2. Accept the case made by the editor. Note that it is a technical
change from what was in the TS.

We suggest a committee straw vote is needed here.
