Subject: Editorial (mostly) I/O list fixes
Date: 2021-June-25

Reference: 21-140

Please be on the lookout for a revised paper before June 28th.
I hope to vote on this paper or a revised paper on Monday if any
changes in a revised paper are minor, and there are no objections.

In 21-140, the editor noted that the use of the term
"input/output list item" and variations thereof are technically
wrong it some circumstances.  Edits are provided below.

Note that there are a lot of edits.  The author tried to search for
all occurrences of the suspect phrases, but might well have missed
some.  If this paper is passed, and when a subsequent revision of
21-007 is available, all of clause 13 (I/O chapters) will be gone
over to find any missing edits.

The interesting circumstances appear to be
  1) "Effective list item" should be replaced by "effective item"
     since the "list" is the list present in the I/O statement,
     and "effective items" are the result of processing the I/O list
     as described in 12.6.3.  There is only one such occurrence.

  2) Anywhere a phrase like "[input][/][output] [list] item" appears,
     in a context where the item corresponds to an edit descriptor, we
     should use "effective item".  Similarly for namelist I/O when
     an input record object name is an array name, ...

Other background:
  -  A complex scalar variable is ONE effective item, even though it
     consumes 2 edit descriptors.  Otherwise, an effective item
     corresponds to one and only one edit descriptor.
  -  each array reference that is a list item in an implied do
     corresponds to zero or more effective items, based on the
     implied do iteration count(s).  Similarly for array shaped
     objects of many varieties.

After due consideration of other uses of input/output list item,
and discussions with the project editor, it seems desirable to NOT
replace all occurrences of "input/output list item" with
"effective item". For example, text requiring allocatable "list"
items in an data transfer statement to be allocated are correct as is.
If we used "effective item" in that restriction, unallocated arrays
would be permissible as long as the containing implied do loop next
had zero iterations.  Not really harmful, but an unnecessarily obtuse
situation.

Also, the phrases "output effective item" and "input effective item"
doesn't exactly roll off the tongue easily, so "input" and "output"
were deleted in these contexts where they were unnecessary.

Lastly, where an occurrence of the suspect phrase(s) appear, but
the subgroup/author thought the existing text was "correct" and
more appropriate, the suspect phrase is listed in the edits with
the comment "no change(s)".
