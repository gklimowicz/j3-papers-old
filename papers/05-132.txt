Subject: libm math functions
Date:    2005 Jan 13


Most Fortran vendors also support C/C++ compilers,
or utilize C/C++ RTLs to supply low-level services.
The C/C++ libm contains a few mathematical routines
which would be of use to Fortran programs.  Standardizing
names for these routines aids portability
of Fortran programs.

Title: C libm functions as Fortran intrinsics

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: C99 7.12 Mathematics <math.h> page 211 et seq.
            Unix Programmer's Manual, Volume 2, System calls
            and Library Routines

Basic Functionality: Add the Bessel functions, hypot, and error functions
                     to the Fortran intrinsic function set
                     for real arguments.

Rationale:  Fortran is mainly used for numerical problems, supplying
            mathematical functions of proven utility will assist
            Fortran is continuing as the premier mathematical programming
            language in the world today.

Estimated Impact: These are proposed intrinsic functions, no other feature
                  is affected.  Impact on vendors is minimal,
                  as most vendors support these functions anyway
                  for their C/C++ compilers.

Detailed Specification: Add subsections to Section 13 detailing
                        the Fortran names for these procedures.  (The C names
                        should not be used due to the common usage, in
                        Fortran, of names such as j0 etc.)

                        The functions are (the C names):

                        Bessel functions (j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn)
                        Error Functions (erf, erfc)
                        Log gamma (gamma)
                        Hypotenuse (hypot)

                        Possible Fortran names are in the proposed edits below.

                        Possible edits are proposed:
