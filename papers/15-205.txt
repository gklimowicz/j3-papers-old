Discussion:

WG5/N2065 is the result from ISO from the ballot on WG5/N2056 TS 18508
Additional Parallel Features in Fortran.  This paper implements the
change proposed by Japan comment 6.  This is a change to require that
the computation of a collective sum by CO_SUM that is returned to all
of the participating images have the same value on those images.


Edits to WG5/N2056:
-------------------

JP6[26:38-43] In 8.4.14 CO_SUM, in the description of the argument A,
replace the last two sentences "If it is a scalar ... all
corresponding elements in the current team." by

"If it is a scalar, the computed value is equal to a
processor-dependent approximation to the sum of the values of A on all
images in the current team.  If it is an array, it shall have the same
shape on all images in the current team and each element of the
computed value is equal to a processor-dependent approximation to the
sum of all corresponding elements of A on the images in the current
team.  If RESULT_IMAGE is present, the computed value may depend on
the image that the RESULT_IMAGE specifies; otherwise, the computed
value is the same on all images in the current team."
