Subject: Response to N2141 ballot comment 003 on assumed rank syntax
Date: 2017 October 17

Reference: 17-007r2

1. Introduction:

The comment requests that the list of lexical tokens be extended to
include ".." which was introduced with assumed rank.

2. Response

We agree.

3. Edit

[50:10] In 6.2.1 Tokens

After ";", insert ", ..", such that the full sentence then reads:

"A lexical token is a keyword, name, literal constant other than a
complex literal constant, operator, statement label, delimiter, comma,
=, =>, :, ::, :, .., or %."
