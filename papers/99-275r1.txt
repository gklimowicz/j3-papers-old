DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress
QUESTION:

Consider:
  INTEGER X(10)
  DATA X(B"001")/42/
  END

This is apparently conforming, since the constraint at [32:15] says
  "A <boz-literal-constant> may appear only in a DATA statement."
But this rules out
  X(B"001") = 42

Is this an error?

ANSWER:

Yes, BOZ literal constants should be restricted to being a
<data-stmt-constant>.

EDITS:

[32:15] Replace text of constraint with
  "A <boz-literal-constant> may appear only as the <data-stmt-constant> in a
   DATA statement."
