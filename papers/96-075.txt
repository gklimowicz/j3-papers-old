Subject: JOR Items to Consider for Fortran 2000


I would ask that the following JoR items be considered for inclusion in
Fortran 2000:

054, 110, 058, 055, 064, 063, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 056, 050

In addition, I would appreciate it if people would look at 061, 062,
057, and 116.  I seriously doubt whether they will be included in Fortran
2000, but I am equally at a loss to see how they might be considered for
revisions beyond then.  The "catch 22" appears to be that they are too
sweeping in their implications to be passed on to WG5 as requirements without
extensive review by the members of X3J3, but X3J3 seems unwilling to spend
that much time on anything that hasn't been given to us by WG5.
