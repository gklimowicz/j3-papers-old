Subject: Comments on Section 16

1.  Edits

381:4,6,7  [The editor was right to re-insert the cross
reference for scoping unit.  But now this cross reference looks
lonesome.  Editor: Add ``(2.2.1)'' after ``scope of a
program'', ``(7.5.3, 7.5.4, 8.1)'' after ``scope of a construct''
and ``(3.3)'' after ``part of a statement''.]

387:15  [A name isn't necessarily global everywhere just because
it's global in one scoping unit.  Editor: ``A'' => ``Within the
scoping unit, a''.]

390:5+  [Concerning lines 5-6 of Note 16.13, the editor
complains (in 02-101) that the note discusses pointers, then their
association status, then uses ``they'' to refer to one or the other, but
to which it's not clear.  It's the pointers.  Editor: To make this
clearer: ``the association status ... undefined'' => ``such
pointers to have an undefined association status''.]

393:7+  [The editor wondered whether the Note to J3 in
01-354r1, after the edit for [379:27-31] in section 2 of that paper, was
intended to be a note, an unresolved issue note, or a question for J3 to
ponder during meeting 159.  It was intended as the last of these, but no
discussion ensued, so maybe it ought to be an unresolved issue note:]

[393:3-4]   Change "For ... shall" to "All scoping units that access named
common blocks with the same name shall".

[393:5-7]   Replace the sentence, "A ... ." with "Blank common blocks may be
declared
with different sizes in different scoping units.  For any two blank common
blocks,
the initial sequence of storage units of the longer blank common block shall be
identical to the sequence of storage units of the shorter blank common block.
If two blank common blocks are of the same length, they shall have the same
sequence of storage units."
