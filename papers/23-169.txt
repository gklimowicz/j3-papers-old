Subject: Interp for allocating a coarray subobject
Date: 2023-June-10

NUMBER: Fxx/xxx
TITLE: Allocating and deallocating a coarray subobject
KEYWORDS: Allocate, coarray
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress
REFERENCES: N2213 (FDIS)

QUESTION 1:
For the allocation of a coarray that is an ultimate component of a 
dummy argument, 9.7.1.2 para 4 imposes conditions on the dummy argument
in the images of the current team. Do these also apply when the coarray
is a potential subobject component? And what about the case were the
dummy argument is an array and the coarray is a potential subobject 
component of an element of the dummy argument?

QUESTION 2:
For the allocation of a coarray that is a subobject of an array 
element, the element is required have the same position in array 
element order on the images of the current team. What happens if the 
array is a dummy argument and the position of the element in the dummy
array differs from that in the ultimate argument?

QUESTION 3: Are similar conditions needed for the deallocation of a
coarray that is a subobject? 

ANSWER 1:
Yes, it was intended that the conditions should apply for the allocation 
of any coarray that is a subobject of a dummy argument. An edit is 
supplied. 

ANSWER 2:
It was intended to refer to the the element order of the ultimate 
argument. An edit is supplied. 

ANSWER 3:
For DEALLOCATE, it was intended that all the active images in the 
team execute DEALLOCATE statements for corresponding coarrays. 
An edit is supplied to require this. The conditions of 9.7.1.2 para 4 
applied when the coarrays were allocated and do not need to be 
restated here. 

EDITS to N2213:
In 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 4, sentences 
4 and 5, change "an ultimate component" to "a subobject" (two changes),
so that the sentences read
"If the coarray is a subobject of a dummy argument, the ultimate 
arguments on those images shall be declared with the same name in the 
same scoping unit. If the coarray is a subobject of an array element, 
the element shall have the same position in array element order on 
those images."

In 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 4, after 
sentence 5 add
"If the array is a dummy argument, it is the position in the element 
order of the ultimate argument that shall be the same." 

In 9.7.3.2 Deallocation of allocatable variables, last sentence of para
10 change "it is" to "the corresponding coarrays are" so that the 
sentence reads "A coarray shall not become deallocated on an image 
unless the corresponding coarrays are successfully deallocated on all 
active images in this team."
