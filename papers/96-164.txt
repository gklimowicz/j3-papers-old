Subject:  ASYNC I/O and INQUIRE

Paper 96-158r2 described the syntax and edits for  asynchronous I/O.

One more piece of functionality is required: a way to ask about a pending I/O
operation, to see if it has completed, without actually waiting for completion.

Two obvious alternatives are:

1. Add a  NOWAIT keyword and a STATUS=char-variable specifier to the WAIT 
statement.   If the pending I/O operation was already completed, then WAIT 
would return 'PENDING' or 'COMPLETE'  in the char-variable (or a 
processor defined value if the handle was not an active handle).  This  has 
the advantage that no additional statements, such as INQUIRE, are possibly 
I/O data transfer statements, or can wait for pending I/O.

OR
 
2. Extend INQUIRE with  HANDLE=value and  PENDING=char-variable 
phrases.  The user would have to specify the unit #, the handle, and 
INQUIRE would return 'YES' or 'NO' in the char-variable specified in the 
PENDING=specifier.

The disadvantage of extending INQUIRE is that it then becomes another 
possible WAIT operation and a data transfer statement (unless we still 
require a WAIT even when PENDING returns a 'NO').   This clutters the 
discussion of WAIT operations and data transfers even more, but may be 
less confusing than a WAIT statement with a NOWAIT keyword.
