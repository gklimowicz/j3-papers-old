Subject: UK Comments GB30-GB32 TS 29113
From: Bill Long/Robert Corbett

Discussion:

The initial comments GB30, 31, and 32 in the UK Ballot were:

GB30: Replace "of the appropriate rank" by "with the same rank as
{source}". {"appropriate rank" is too vague. The rank must be that of
{source}.}

GB31: Before "If" add "The {type} member specifies the type of the
array section." {It would be much better to give the purpose of {type}
here rather than at the end of the paragraph after the elem_len
paragraph.}

GB32: Delete "The corresponding ... result.". {The proposed change for
"result" makes the sentence "The corresponding ... result."
redundant.}

Regarding GB30, the new edit might be read as implying that {source}
has a rank, but source is just a pointer to a C descriptor.  The
descriptor is what has the rank member.

Regarding GB31, the edit itself is fine. However, the last sentence of
the paragraph following the formal parameter descriptions, "In the C
descriptor pointed to by {result}, the {type} member shall be the
specifier for the type of the part.", is now redundant and should be
deleted.

GB32 is fine as is, and included here to keep these three together.


Edits to N1869:

5.3.5.8, replace the description of the result parameter for
CFI_select_part with
"\cf{result} shall be the address of a C descriptor.  The \cf{type}
member of the C descriptor shall specify the type of the array section.
The \cf{attribute} member shall have the value CFI_attribute_assumed
or CFI_attribute_pointer.  If the address specified by \cf{result} is
the value of a C formal parameter that corresponds to a Fortran actual
argument or a C actual argument that corresponds to a Fortran dummy
argument, the \cf{attribute} member shall have the value
CFI_attribute_pointer.  The \cf{rank} member of the C descriptor shall
have the same value as the \cf{rank} member of the C descriptor at the
address specified by \cf{source}.". {GB30, GB31}

5.3.5.8, in the description of the source parameter for
CFI_select_part, delete the last sentence "The corresponding values
... source and result.". {GB32.}

5.3.5.8, in the paragraph following the description of the elem_len
parameter for CFI_select_part - delete the last sentence "In the C
descriptor pointed to by result, ... type of the part." {Added edit
for GB31.}
