TITLE: Optional arguments to MAX/MIN
KEYWORDS: intrinsic function, MAX, MIN, optional, argument
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

It appears that there is a missing "optional" in the description of
the optional arguments [, A3, ...] in the MAX and MIN functions.  In
the Fortran 90 standard, the MAX/MIN descriptions said "optional
arguments.  A3, ...", but those words do not appear 13.14.64 of the
Fortran 95 standard.

Section 13.3 [217:27+] states

  ...optional arguments... are identified by the notation "optional"
  in the argument descriptions.

and goes on to describe another notation for the arguments that are
listed as optional.  But it doesn't say anything about arguments
given in [...] and NOT also listed as optional.

Suggested change to the argument descriptions for MAX and MIN:

Arguments.
A1, A2     shall both have the same type which shall be integer or
           real and they shall both have the same kind type parameter.

A3, ... (optional)  shall have the same type and kind type parameter
           as A1.

ANSWER:

There is an anomaly in the presentation of MAX and MIN but the intent
is clear, ie, dummy arguments A3 and beyond are optional.

EDITS:  None

NOTE:

The same descriptive form reported here in Fortran 95 appears in
Fortran 2003 for MAX and MIN.
