The standard uses the term "procedure heading" in two
places (8.9 NAMELIST statement, paragraph 5, and
15.6.2.2 FUNCTION subprogram, paragraph 3), but it
does not define the term.  The term appears to mean
the FUNCTION or SUBROUTINE statement that starts a
subprogram.  In the two contexts in which the term
appears, it means the FUNCTION statement that starts
a function subprogram.  Edits to eliminate the uses
of the undefined term are provided.
