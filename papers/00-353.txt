          Subject:  COMPATIBLE Rounding Mode in INQUIRE Statement

Rationale
  The normative text for the ROUND= specifier in the INQUIRE statement (9.8.1.28) does not include "COMPATIBLE" in
the list of values that can be returned.  We need to fix this oversight.

Edits
  Edits are with respect to the 00-007r3.
            [205:2-3,7] Add "COMPATIBLE" to the list in two places.
