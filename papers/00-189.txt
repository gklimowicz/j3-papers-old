Subject:   Usage of DELIM= in control-info-list of data transfer statement

concerns:  J3/00-007R1 section 9.5.1

"DELIM=" can now only be specified in an OPEN statement. It is not allowed
to specify it also in the control-info-list of a READ statement.

During input of a number of records it happens that the format of the data
is different in the various records. That is why I strongly suggest to add
"DELIM=" to the io-control-spec-list of the control-info- list of a READ
statement for flexibility and consistency.

Suggested edits:

In 9.5.1:
-Add to R913 a line "or DELIM = scalar-default-char-expr"
-Add a paragraph " The DELIM= specifier is described in 9.4.4. It overrules
the value specified in the OPEN statement for the current data transfer
statement."
