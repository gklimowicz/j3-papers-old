   From: X3J3                                                   page 1 of 1
   Subject: Liaison report on CoCo

   References: X3J3/96-063, X3J3/96-067, X3J3/96-068,
               X3J3/96-072, X3J3/96-102, X3J3/96-105

   Regarding X3J3/96-068:

     o  Change "CoCo" to "coco" in BNF terms

     o  Delete section 10 other than a mechanism to specify initial values
        for CoCo variables

     o  Replace section 11 with a note suggesting that lines in FALSE blocks
        and directive lines themselves be:

          o  deleted,
          o  replaced with blank lines, or
          o  replaced with ! in column 1 followed by the original source
             line shifted to the right by 1 column

     o  The STOP directive has been reinstated and means that source
        preprocessing immediately stops.

     o  There is no implication that the output of the preprocessor comprises
        a valid Fortran program.

     o  R701 (the ??ERROR directive) has been simplified to:

          R701  coco-error-directive    is   ERROR [coco-output-item-list]


     Regarding X3J3/96-102:

     o  A number of straw votes were taken on the fpp model.  The general
        tenor of the straw votes were simplification of the model (where
        a vendor could extend the model to more closely match existing
        implementations of cpp).  For example, one straw vote was in favor
        of limiting the # character to appearing in column 1.

     o  Some summary straw votes were taken that indicated that the
        majority of the committee would accept either model.
