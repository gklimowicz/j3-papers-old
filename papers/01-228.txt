1. Introduction

Issue 315 says
  "The terms "construct entity" and "associating entity" always denote
objects.
   Perhaps they should be "construct object" and "associating object"."

It is not clear that these always denote objects - for instance, a construct
entity can be associated with the result of an expression evaluation.

Even if they did, I am not in favour of changing our currently working
terminology.

We've never had problems in the past with "statement and construct
entities",
I see no problem now.

The various descriptions read quite well as they are now, with "construct
entities" and at least some of them would not read well with "construct
objects".

This is way below my "wordsmithing" threshold.
