Title: Interoperability of optional arguments

Status: For consideration

Basic Functionality:
  Extension to C Interop that allows optional arguments to be
  interoperable.

Rationale:
  If C functions have a mechanism to indicate and detect missing
  optional arguments, the class of Fortran subprograms that
  interoperate with C would be significantly expanded. 

Estimated Impact:
  Small impact for the standard and probably small to moderate
  impact for the processors.

Detailed Specification:

  A procedure interface which has OPTIONAL dummy arguments can have the
  BIND(C) attribute and be interoperable. The VALUE attribute is not
  allowed for optional dummy arguments in a BIND(C) interface. The
  interoperable C prototype is the same as if the OPTIONAL attribute
  were not present, the only difference is the function reference on the
  C side. Namely, a C caller specifies a missing actual argument in a
  function reference by passing a NULL data pointer as the argument
  value if the corresponding dummy argument is a data object, or a NULL
  procedure pointer as the argument value if the corresponding dummy
  argument is a procedure. A Fortran procedure, as usual, omits the
  actual argument in the procedure reference.
