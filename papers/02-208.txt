        Center by the chair, Dan Nagle.

        This is last meeting before WG5:  the goal is to address every
        remaining issue.

        The August joint J3/WG5 meeting starts on Sunday, not Monday.

        At this meeting we will process editor's unresolved issues,
        then go on to papers.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda - D. Nagle

**     motion: adopt the agenda for meeting #161 as amended
               (moved by Dedo/seconded by Snyder) -
               passed by unanimous consent (u.c.)

               There will be a TAG meeting Thursday.

       The final agenda is in Appendix A.

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 160 minutes - D. Nagle

**      motion: approve meeting #160 minutes == paper 02-159
                (Snyder/Dedo) - u.c.

1.1.4 NCITS/OMC report - D. Nagle

        Annual report was filed.  Report says we are on time and on
        target to turn draft standard over to WG5.  We don't
        anticipate any problems.  We now have a members only mailing
        list.  Membership is growing slowly.  We have a liaison to H2.

        Larry Meadows has volunteered to be liaison to IEEE 754R
        working group.

1.1.5 ISO/WG5 report - Van Snyder, IR

        No report.

        At TAG meeting, vote on ballot response to C fixed point
        arithmetic and form delegation to WG5 meeting.

1.1.6 H2 Liaison report - C. Dedo - nothing to report

1.1.7 Treasurer's report - M. North

        April 30 -- $3663.63
        There are no outstanding bills

1.1.8 Beginning membership report - K. Hirchert

        IBM (Rob James) is now a member.
        Compaq has dropped off the list due to non attendance.
        There will be 11 members present.
        Rich Bleikamp will be in jeopardy.

        At the request of INCITS we have updated our 001, the names
        of all people who do not have an official connection to J3
        have been removed from 001.  012 is the list of observers,
        former members, interested persons, etc.

        See appendix E for details.

1.1.9 Local arrangements - M. North

        We can no longer bring in "unsealed" refreshments.  We can
        bring in canned pop, sealed candy bars, etc.  But not chips
        and dip, etc.  Unless the hotel provides them--a new health
        department regulation.  We have ordered refreshments from the
        hotel for 10AM and 3PM for this week.  This will use up most
        of the meeting fee.

        Discussion of what to do at WG5 meeting for entertainment.
        Possibilities include dinner/show combination.  M. North will
        try to get an estimate of number of attendees.  We could
        arrange for a dinner/buffet hosted by J3 and then arrange for
        tickets if people want to attend a show.  M. North will
        investigate.

    Future meetings.

        Current schedule is:  Aug 11-16/WG5 2002, Nov 11-15 2002,
        March 29-Apr 4 2003/WG5.

        We need to think about schedule for rest of 2003.  There are
        about 20 weeks between Nov and March meeting--should we
        schedule a meeting in the interim?  It's hard to predict flow
        of public comments.

    John Reid's target schedule

14-Jul-2002                Page  4 of 26                        02-208

        Possibilities are to defer Nov 2002 meeting until late
        January 2003 so we can collect US comments and submit them to
        WG5.

        Defer discussion until this afternoon.

1.1.10 Comments from members

        M. North is retiring; his fee is paid through December.  It's
        unclear how long he will continue to attend.  North will
        investigate other cities to meet in.

        Snyder:  We could work on modules TR at Nov meeting.  This
        would allow work on the TR to proceed without interfering
        with work on the standard.

1.2 Subgroup organization and initial paper assignments - D. Nagle

        For this meeting, subgroups will be responsible for their
        traditional chapters.  Sub groups should work on issues

        Comment from Mallory:  e-mail from JKR, answered a few
        schedule questions.  We might reschedule Nov meeting to Jan
        and use Desert Research Institute meeting rooms.  Mallory
        still investigating.

        JKR says there will be 3 month public comment period
        beginning in early October, which implies we'd need to meet
        in early to mid December to process comments.  But, it will
        probably be hard to get rooms here in December.  Mallory
        proposes keeping November meeting.  Still unclear about
        schedule.

        Possibly have an August 2003 J3 meeting

        We can informally start US public comment period as soon as
        document is available.  We don't need to wait for ISO to
        start period.  This will let us set a deadline for us comment
        in early Nov and meet as planned to produce public comment.

        How long should/must we allow for US public comment?  Does
        NCITS have a rule? Right now, we'll plan on leaving it in
        November and not do a January meeting.  Leave the April/May
        joint meeting and do another meeting in Aug after the WG5
        meeting.

        Plenary recessed until 8:00 am Tuesday.
