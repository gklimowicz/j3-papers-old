---------------------

Unresolved Technical Issue 70 (page 418) observes that the end of the
description of the RANDOM_NUMBER intrinsic does not apply for
arguments of type bits.  There are two options. One is to expand the
description to cover both the real (current text) and bits (new text
needed) cases. The other is to delete the end of the sentence. The
same information is repeated a few lines later anyway.  The second
option seems simpler.

Edits:
-----

[418:27-28] Delete "from the uniform distribution over the range 0 <= x < 1".
