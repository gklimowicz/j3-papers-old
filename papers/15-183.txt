Discussion
----------

In the context of TS 18508, specific issues were raised as soon as
events were introduced, but have never been addressed.  Leaving some
uses processor-dependent (i.e. unspecified) and others undefined is
fine, but it is essential to agree what defined uses actually do, and
exactly where the boundaries are with processor-dependent and undefined.
Currently, none of that is agreed, let alone specified.  N1971, 13-352
and several other documents contain examples of open questions.

We do not necessarily need a precise consistency model, but we DO need
to know that one could be produced, in theory.  There are three key
points:

    1) Events look simple, but are not, because semaphores are not known
to be even self-consistent, and 'obvious truths' in parallel semantics
are very likely to be false.  See Background for how the Java people got
caught by that one, and how POSIX semaphores are a well-known trap.

    2) I have been unable to find a consensus in WG5 as to the semantic
intent, and individual people's answers have usually indicated that they
often hold two incompatible views.  The current wording of TS 18508
reflects that.  I have proposed three possible solutions:

    3) I cannot guarantee that any of these solutions are both
consistent and implementable under all circumstances (see Background
again for why that is unavoidable), but they are the best that I can do.



Proposed Solution One
---------------------

This would make examples A.3.2 and A.3.3 both defined, except for the
progress issue.

[17:15+] Add a new paragraph after 7.2p2:

    "All changes to event variables are sequentially consistent, and
    the values returned from EVENT_QUERY are consistent with that
    ordering."

[17:26+] Add a new Note to 7.2:

    NOTE:
    Segments, including those ordered by event statements, are required
    to be in a partial order, which implies some restrictions on the
    possible synchronisation methods for events.

[18:1+] Add a new paragraph to 7.3:

    "the completion of an EVENT POST statement does not depend on the
    execution of a matching EVENT WAIT statement."

[18:2-4] Delete the paragraph (7.3p4).

[18:21-24] Replace 7.4p3 by:

    "If an EVENT WAIT statement using an event variable is executed with
    a threshold of k when the event variable has a value of n, and
    k <= n, the segments preceding all of the EVENT POST statements
    that have updated that event variable will precede the segment
    following the EVENT WAIT statement.  If k > n, the EVENT WAIT
    statement will wait until the value of the event variable reaches k.

EVENT_QUERY is now an anomalous intrinsic procedure that performs logic
(but not data) synchronisation, and I feel that it would be better in a
new class.

[18:25+] Delete NOTE 7.4 because it is now normative.

[27:21+] Add a new paragraph to 8.4.15:

    "If the value returned by an EVENT_QUERY invocation is in position k
    of the sequence of values that the event variable takes during
    execution and the EVENT_QUERY invocation precedes an EVENT WAIT
    invocation on the variable, the segment preceding the EVENT POST
    statement that made change i, for any i <= k, will precede the
    segment following that EVENT WAIT statement."

[27:21+] Add a new Note to 8.4.15:

    "NOTE 8.x
    This means that EVENT_QUERY has a synchronization effect, but it
    does not mean that it synchronizes data updates."

[49:22+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.1:

    "Because this TS does not specify a progress requirement, whether
    this program will make progress is processor-dependent."

[50:35+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.2:

    "Because this TS does not specify a progress requirement, whether
    this program will make progress is processor-dependent.  Note that
    the value returned from EVENT_QUERY for event variables on other
    images is used solely for failure handling."



Proposed Solution Two
---------------------

This would make example A.3.2 defined, except for the progress issue,
but A.3.3 would be processor-dependent.

[17:15+] Add a new paragraph after 7.2p2:

    "All changes to event variables are sequentially consistent, and
    the values returned from EVENT_QUERY for variables on the executing
    image are consistent with that ordering."

[17:26+] Add a new Note to 7.2:

    NOTE:
    Segments, including those ordered by event statements, are required
    to be in a partial order, which implies some restrictions on the
    possible synchronisation methods for events.

[18:1+] Add a new paragraph to 7.3:

    "the completion of an EVENT POST statement does not depend on the
    execution of a matching EVENT WAIT statement."

[18:2-4] Delete the paragraph (7.3p4).

[18:21-24] Replace 7.4p3 by:

    "If an EVENT WAIT statement using an event variable is executed with
    a threshold of k when the event variable has a value of n, and
    k <= n, the segments preceding all of the EVENT POST statements
    that have updated that event variable will precede the segment
    following the EVENT WAIT statement.  If k > n, the EVENT WAIT
    statement will wait until the value of the event variable reaches k.

[18:25+] Delete NOTE 7.4 because it is now normative.

[27:21+] Add a new paragraph to 8.4.15:

    "If the value returned by an EVENT_QUERY invocation on an event
    variable on the same image is in position k of the sequence of
    values that the event variable takes during execution and the
    EVENT_QUERY invocation precedes an EVENT WAIT invocation on the
    variable, the segment preceding the EVENT POST statement that made
    change i, for any i <= k, will precede the segment following that
    EVENT WAIT statement."

[49:22+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.1:

    "Because this TS does not specify a progress requirement, whether
    this program will make progress is processor-dependent."

[50:35+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.2:

    "Because this TS does not specify a progress requirement, whether
    this program will make progress and whether it detects failure
    reliably is processor-dependent."



Proposed Solution Three
-----------------------

This would make examples A.3.1 and A.3.2 both processor-dependent, but
would be by far the easiest to implement and most efficient.

[17:26+] Add a new Note to 7.2:

    NOTE:
    Segments, including those ordered by event statements, are required
    to be in a partial order, which implies some restrictions on the
    possible synchronisation methods for events.

[18:1+] Add a new paragraph to 7.3:

    "A program that depends on the segment following an EVENT POST
    statement being executed before a matching EVENT WAIT statement is
    executed for that event variable is not conforming."

[18:2-4] Delete the paragraph (7.3p4).

[18:4+] Delete NOTE 7.2.

[18:22] Change "at least" to "exactly" in 7.4p3.

[18:23] Following the first "WAIT statement." in 7.4p3, add:

    "If the event variable has a value of greater than k, which of those
    segments precede the EVENT WAIT is processor-dependent.  Once an
    execution of an EVENT POST statement has been matched in this way,
    it will not be used for matching in subsequent EVENT WAIT
    statements."

[18:25+] Replace the body of NOTE 7.4 in 7.4 by:

    "The ordering of segments is precisely that defined by the execution
    of the image control statements, and the value of the event variable
    (as returned from EVENT_QUERY) is purely indicative".

[49:22+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.1:

    "Because the value returned from EVENT_QUERY is purely indicative,
    whether these programs behave as expected is processor-dependent."

[50:35+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.2:

    "Because the value returned from EVENT_QUERY is purely indicative
    whether this example behaves as expected is processor-dependent."



FULL DISCUSSION
---------------
---------------

Background
----------

Events are general semaphores (as distinct from binary semaphores),
which are often called counting semaphores, restricted by only the
owning image being able to wait on them, so there are many APIs that use
them.  However, every specification I have found has been merely the
syntax and intent, with only a few aspects of the semantics specified.
What is more, there are rarely any useful constraints on what those
semantics may be, so they are closer to Fortran undefined than
processor-dependent.  POSIX is well-known for that (see below).

Up until the late 1960s, essentially all parallel experts believed that
parallel correctness was merely a matter of getting the synchronisation
right, but experience with the early parallel systems showed that was
not even approximately true.  It was another decade before any real
progress was made (Hoare in 1978 and Lamport in 1979) - that identified
data consistency as the key concept, and one that could NOT be reduced
to a synchronisation property.

Dijkstra invented semaphores in 1962/3, and described them solely as
synchronisation facilities, with only an API (in the above sense).  In
over 50 years, nobody seems to have been able to provide a specification
of general semaphores that does not contain serious ambiguities or
inconsistencies, and many of the experts I have talked to suspect that
it is impossible.  See, for example:

    https://github.com/android/platform_bionic/blob/master/libc/...
        .../bionic/semaphore.cpp

// Memory order requirements for POSIX semaphores appear unclear and are
// currently interpreted inconsistently.
// We conservatively prefer sequentially consistent operations for now.
// CAUTION: This is more conservative than some other major
// implementations, and may change if and when the issue is resolved.

An indication of how deceptive this area is may be seen by the fact that
it was only in the early 1990s that the theoreticians finally managed to
understand the relationship between causality (i.e. that which is
delivered by sychronisation) and the 'obvious' semantics.  See, for
example:

    http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.41.6403
    http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.50.3356

Fortran events impose the restriction that they can be waited on only by
their owning image, but that simplifies their semantics only very
slightly (see below), and a precise specification of them remains
beyond the state of the art in computer science.

The situation is far nastier than it seems to be, because a lot of
hardware and software optimisations allow apparent time reversal, causal
violations, and 'out of thin air' effects, and that includes IBM POWER.
Despite common belief, such effects cannot be excluded by ANY
specification that limits itself to the semantics of a single semaphore.

None of the experts I know trust their own intuition, because it is so
common that 'obviously correct' specifications contain serious flaws,
often unusabilities or inconsistencies.  I have been following this area
for 40 years, have 20 years practical experience of supporting parallel
programmers, and am still learning new ways in which 'obvious truths'
are incorrect.  Java has had threading since 1995, but its model was
discovered to be badly flawed only in 2003 or so, and it had to be
replaced in 2004.

    http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/

These are not purely theoretical issues, either, as I can witness from
helping people with parallel problems.  Even apparent time reversal,
causal violations and 'out of thin air' effects really do occur in many
parallel contexts.  Speaking to other people in the parallel development
and support area, most of them had encountered similar issues, but
resolved them by rewriting code to use different facilities or a
different algorithm, sometimes repeating that for each new environment!



Issue 1 (Blocking)
------------------

Is EVENT POST allowed to block until there is a matching EVENT WAIT?

The reason that this is a critical question is that all image control
statements except SYNC MEMORY are allowed to block, and the ordering of
that is explicitly processor-dependent (8.5.5p4).  The point is that
message-passing implementations have to ensure that all relevant
outstanding transfers (including externally-initiated ones) are
completed appropriately, and it is very hard to identify them without
blocking.

It appears that the consensus is "no", in the light of the decision
taken in Las Vegas to require asynchronous progress (N2020), but it is
not clear from the current normative wording.  The current Note 7.2
clarifies nothing, unfortunately.  Specifically, are the following
programs required to terminate?

    PROGRAM Block_One
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: event[*]
        IF (NUM_IMAGES() /= 2) STOP
        POST(event[3-THIS_IMAGE()])
    END PROGRAM Block_One

    PROGRAM  Block_Two
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: event[*]
        IF (NUM_IMAGES() /= 2) STOP
        POST(event[3-THIS_IMAGE()])
        WAIT(event)
    END PROGRAM Block_Two


Solution A: If those are conforming:
----------

[18:1+] Add a new paragraph to 7.3:

    "The completion of an EVENT POST statement does not depend on the
    execution of a matching EVENT WAIT statement."


Solution B: If not:
----------

[18:1+] Add a new paragraph to 7.3:

    "A program that depends on the segment following an EVENT POST
    statement being executed before a matching EVENT WAIT statement is
    executed for that event variable is not conforming."



Issue 2 (EVENT_QUERY)
---------------------

Is the segment ordering required to match the value of the event
variable, and must that be consistent across images?

Are the following programs conforming?

    PROGRAM Query_One
! This asks whether, if the event count is higher than the wait
! count, the WAIT synchronises after all of the POSTs
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: event[*]
        INTEGER :: data[*] = 0, count
        IF (NUM_IMAGES() /= 2) STOP
        IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) THEN
            DO
                CALL EVENT_QUERY(event,count)
                IF (count == 2) EXIT
            END DO
            WAIT(event)
            data = 1
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 2) THEN
            POST(event[1])
            data[1] = 0
            POST(event[1])
        END IF
    END PROGRAM Query_One

    PROGRAM Query_Two
! Assuming the answer to Query_One is "yes", this asks whether the event
! count must be consistent across all images
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: event_1[*], event_2[*]
        INTEGER :: data[*] = 0, count
        IF (NUM_IMAGES() /= 3) STOP
        IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) THEN
            WAIT(event_2)
            WAIT(event_1)
            data = 1
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 2) THEN
            POST(event_1[1])
            data[1] = 0
            POST(event_1[1])
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 3) THEN
            DO
                CALL EVENT_QUERY(event_1[1],count)
                IF (count == 2) EXIT
            END DO
            POST(event_2[1])
       END IF
    END PROGRAM Query_Two

    PROGRAM Query_Three
! Assuming the answer to Query_One is "yes", this asks whether waiting
! for the event count to reach the required value is enough (as distinct
! from requiring the WAIT to be executed)
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: event[*]
        INTEGER :: data[*] = 0, count
        IF (NUM_IMAGES() /= 2) STOP
        IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) THEN
            WAIT(event)
            DO
                CALL EVENT_QUERY(event,count)
                IF (count == 1) EXIT
            END DO
            data = 1
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 2) THEN
            POST(event[1])
            data[1] = 0
            POST(event[1])
        END IF
    END PROGRAM Query_Three

Five plausible responses are "no, no, no", "yes, no, no", "yes, yes,
no", "yes, no, yes" and "yes, yes, yes".  The solution depends on which
one is preferred.


Solution A: If "no, no, no":
----------

I favour this, and there are certainly some other people who do, but I
do not know whether we are in a majority.

[18:22] Change "at least" to "exactly" in 7.4p3.

[18:23-24] In 7.4p3, replace the sentence:

    "The segment following a different EVENT WAIT statement using the
    same event variable can be ordered to succeed segments preceding
    other EVENT POST statements using that event variable.

by:

    "If the event variable has a value of greater than k, which of those
    segments precede the EVENT WAIT is processor-dependent.  Once an
    execution of an EVENT POST statement has been matched in this way,
    it will not be used for matching in subsequent EVENT WAIT
    statements."

[18:25+] Replace the body of NOTE 7.4 in 7.4 by:

    "The ordering of segments is precisely that defined by the execution
    of the image control statements, and the value of the event variable
    (as returned from EVENT_QUERY) is purely indicative".

[49:13+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.1:

    "Because the value returned from EVENT_QUERY is purely indicative,
    this program is processor-dependent."

[50:35+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.2:

    "Because the value returned from EVENT_QUERY is purely indicative,
    this program is processor-dependent."



Solution B: If "yes, no, no":
----------

My understanding from what they have said is that many people expect
this.

[18:21-24] Replace 7.4p3 by:

    "If an EVENT WAIT statement using an event variable is executed with
    a threshold of k when the event variable has a value of n, and
    k <= n, the segments preceding all of the EVENT POST statements
    that have updated that event variable will precede the segment
    following the EVENT WAIT statement.  If k > n, the EVENT WAIT
    statement will wait until the value of the event variable reaches k.

[18:25+] Delete NOTE 7.4 because it is now normative.

[27:21+] Add a new paragraph to 8.4.15:

    "If the value returned by an EVENT_QUERY invocation on an event
    variable on the same image is in position k of the sequence of
    values that the event variable takes during execution and the
    EVENT_QUERY invocation precedes an EVENT WAIT invocation on the
    variable, the segment preceding the EVENT POST statement that made
    change i, for any i <= k, will precede the segment following that
    EVENT WAIT statement."

[49:22+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.1:

    "Because this TS does not specify a progress requirement, whether
    this program will make progress is processor-dependent."

[50:35+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.2:

    "Because this TS does not specify a progress requirement, whether
    this program will make progress and whether it detects failure
    reliably is processor-dependent.


Solution C: If "yes, yes, no":
----------

This differs from solution B in making example A.3.3 less deceptive and
requiring EVENT_QUERY to synchronised.  I do not like it, because I
can't convince myself that it doesn't have some nasty ambiguities
lurking, and it adds serious inefficiency, but am prepared to propose it
for the sake of consensus.

[18:21-24] Replace 7.4p3 by:

    "If an EVENT WAIT statement using an event variable is executed with
    a threshold of k when the event variable has a value of n, and
    k <= n, the segments preceding all of the EVENT POST statements
    that have updated that event variable will precede the segment
    following the EVENT WAIT statement.  If k > n, the EVENT WAIT
    statement will wait until the value of the event variable reaches k.

[18:25+] Delete NOTE 7.4 because it is now normative.

[27:21+] Add a new paragraph to 8.4.15:

    "If the value returned by an EVENT_QUERY invocation is in position k
    of the sequence of values that the event variable takes during
    execution and the EVENT_QUERY invocation precedes an EVENT WAIT
    invocation on the variable, the segment preceding the EVENT POST
    statement that made change i, for any i <= k, will precede the
    segment following that EVENT WAIT statement."

EVENT_QUERY is now an anomalous intrinsic procedure that performs logic
(but not data) synchronisation, and I feel that it would be better in a
new class.

[27:21+] Add a new Note to 8.4.15:

    "NOTE 8.x
    This means that EVENT_QUERY has a synchronization effect, but it
    does not mean that it synchronizes data updates."

[49:22+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.1:

    "Because this TS does not specify a progress requirement, whether
    this program will make progress is processor-dependent."

[50:35+] Add a new paragraph to A.3.2:

    "Because this TS does not specify a progress requirement, whether
    this program will make progress is processor-dependent.  Note that
    the value returned from EVENT_QUERY for event variables on other
    images is used solely for failure handling."


Solution E: If "yes, no, yes":
----------

I do not think that anyone on WG5 favours this, though some users may,
so I have not tried to specify it.


Solution F: If "yes, yes, yes":
----------

I sincerely hope that nobody on WG5 favours this, but some people have
said things that are equivalent to it.

The best solution in this case would be to change EVENT_QUERY from a
subroutine into an image control statement, but there seems to be no
willingness to do that.  If not, the next best solution would be a new
class of intrinsic subroutine, i.e. an atomic one containing an image
control statement, but that would mean significant changes to the TS
and main standard.



Issue 3 (Sequential Consistency)
--------------------------------

In Fortran 2008, the segment ordering is necessarily transitive (i.e. a
mathematical partial order, as Note 8.31 says).  The only explicit,
normative and general requirement is in 2.3.5p1 "...  segments executed
by separate images are partially ordered by image control statements."

Unfortunately, semaphores are NOT necessarily sequentially consistent
(see reference above), code sections ordered by them are NOT necessarily
in a mathematical partial order (unlike the locks in Fortran 2008), and
there is no normative requirement for that in TS 18508.  The reason for
this is that the event variable count is anonymous, and therefore
provides no information on the ordering of the EVENT POST statements.

One interpretation is that that wording in 2.3.5p1 is a requirement on
all features introduced into Fortran by future Technical Specifications.
Another is that it is present to constrain the the processor-dependent
semantics specified in 8.5.5 (SYNC MEMORY), and does not necessarily
apply to future language extensions.  Both are reasonable.

Worse, the ordering of semaphores is described solely in terms of the
event variable, and we have NOT required atomic variables to be
sequentially consistent (on efficiency grounds).  It is therefore
unclear whether that wording in Fortran 2008 constrains segment ordering
by events or not.

Thiss leads on to the question of whether values returned from
EVENT_QUERY are required to be (globally) consistent with the ordering
of EVENT POSTs and EVENT WAITs, even when it is called in an unordered
segment.

And, lastly, this is a fiendishly complicated area, which took 30 years
between identification and understanding in computer science (see
Background), and I am only 90% certain that sequential consistency of
events and transitivity of sent-ordered segments are equivalent.  There
are some published results, but they are in a fairly weird notation, and
I am not sure that I have correctly translated them to Fortran terms.

Aside: for people not familiar with parallel data models, sequential
consistency is a global attribute, and cannot be specified by any
wording that applies to each object separately.

Are events required to be sequentially consistent?

Is the following program required to print '1'?  I assume that the
answer is "yes".

    PROGRAM SC_One
! This is a classic example, and a surprising number of environments
! will, at least on occasion, print '0' (which indicates simultaneous
! access to data in unordered segments) -  'obviously' that can't
! happen, but parallelism is no more obvious than quantum mechanics.
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: event[*]
        INTEGER :: data[*] = 0
        IF (NUM_IMAGES() /= 3) STOP
        IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) THEN
            WAIT(event)
            POST(event[2])
            PRINT *, data
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 2) THEN
            WAIT(event)
            POST(event[1])
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 3) THEN
            data[1] = 1
            POST(event[1])
        END IF
    END PROGRAM SC_One

This example is relevant only if the answer to Query_One (sic) is "yes",
because otherwise the ordinary atomic consistency rules (whatever they
are) apply.  Is the following defined to print "1"?  I assume that the
answer is "yes".

    PROGRAM SC_Two
! Consider an implementation with multiple point-to-point links, where
! an EVENT WAIT requests the posting image to ensure that all updates
! have been completed.  That is the conventional 'pull' model of
! data synchronisation.

        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: event[*]
        INTEGER :: data[*] = 0
        IF (NUM_IMAGES() /= 4) STOP
        IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) THEN
            data[4] = 1
            EVENT POST (event[3])    ! Post A
            EVENT POST (event[2])
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 2) THEN
            EVENT WAIT (event)
            EVENT POST (event[3])    ! Post B
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 3) THEN
            EVENT WAIT (event)    ! Waits on post B
            ! Waits for image 2 (i.e. Post B) to synchronise data
            PRINT *, data[4]
            EVENT WAIT (event)    ! Waits on post A
            ! Waits for image 1 (i.e. Post A) to synchronise data
        END IF
    END PROGRAM SC_Two

Is the following program allowed to print "1 0" from image 3 and "0 1"
from image 4, as well as conversely?

    PROGRAM SC_Three
! This is the classic IRIW example, and often occurs when the network
! has multiple paths between two points.  It is obviously the most
! likely to fail.
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: event[*]
        INTEGER :: count_1, count_2
        IF (NUM_IMAGES() /= 6) STOP
        IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) THEN
            POST(event[5])
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 2) THEN
            POST(event[6])
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 3) THEN
            CALL EVENT_QUERY(event[5],count_1)
            CALL EVENT_QUERY(event[6],count_2)
            PRINT *, count_1, count_2
        ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 4) THEN
            CALL EVENT_QUERY(event[6],count_2)
            CALL EVENT_QUERY(event[5],count_1)
            PRINT *, count_1, count_2
        END IF
    END PROGRAM SC_Three

It would be a good idea to close the issue by explicitly requiring
sequential consistency for events and, if the answer to Query_Three is
"yes", to include EVENT_QUERY, and to include a Note clarifying that
2.3.5p1 applies to event-ordered segments.


Solution A: If the answer to Issue 2 (sic) is "yes, yes, yes":
----------

[17:15+] Add a new paragraph after 7.2p2:

    "All changes to event variables are sequentially consistent, and
    the values returned from EVENT_QUERY are consistent with that
    ordering."

[17:26+] Add a new Note to 7.2:

    NOTE:
    Segments, including those ordered by event statements, are required
    to be in a partial order, which implies some restrictions on the
    possible synchronisation methods for events.


Solution B: Otherwise, if the answer to Query_One is "yes":
----------

[17:15+] Add a new paragraph after 7.2p2:

    "All changes to event variables are sequentially consistent, and
    the values returned from EVENT_QUERY for variables on the executing
    image are consistent with that ordering."

[17:26+] Add a new Note to 7.2:

    NOTE:
    Segments, including those ordered by event statements, are required
    to be in a partial order, which implies some restrictions on the
    possible synchronisation methods for events.


Solution C: Otherwise:
----------

[17:26+] Add a new Note to 7.2:

    NOTE:
    Segments, including those ordered by event statements, are required
    to be in a partial order, which implies some restrictions on the
    possible synchronisation methods for events.



Issue 4 (Tidying Up)
--------------------

One response to these issues was to add the following paragraph to
7.3p4 (EVENT POST):

    "If the segment that precedes an EVENT POST statement is unordered
    with respect to the segment that precedes another EVENT POST
    statement for the same event variable, the order of execution of the
    EVENT POST statements is processor dependent."

I am unable to see that it adds anything useful.  That never was
disputed and does not resolve any problems.  It should be deleted.

[18:2-4] Delete the paragraph (7.3p4).
