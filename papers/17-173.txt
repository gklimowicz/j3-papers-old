Discussion:

In Note 9.24 we currently say the deallocation of a coarray at the end
of a procedure causes an "implicit synchronization of all
images". That is out-dated text that fails to account for the changes
in F2015 for teams and active images. An edit is supplied to fix
this. The same problem exists on Note 9.20.


Edit to N2123:

[143:Note 9.20] In 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, in the
only note of the subclause, in the last sentence change

"same on all images"

to

"same on all images in the current team".

[146:Note 9.24] In 9.7.3.2 Deallocation of allocatable variables, in
the last Note of the subclause, change the end of the sentence

"implicit synchronization of all images."

to

"implicit synchronization of all active images in the current team."
