NUMBER: F18/037
TITLE: Locality spec limitations
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

BACKGROUND

In 11.1.7.2 Form of the DO construct, C1128 states
  "A <variable-name> that appears in a LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT
   <locality-spec> shall not have the ALLOCATABLE, INTENT (IN), or
   OPTIONAL attribute, shall not be of finalizable type, shall not be
   a nonpointer polymorphic dummy argument, and shall not be a coarray
   or an assumed-size array."

QUESTION:

Q1. Was it intended to allow a variable with an ultimate component of
    finalizable type here?

Q2. Was it intended to allow a variable with a coarray ultimate
    component here?

Q3. Was it intended to allow a variable with an allocatable ultimate
    component here?

ANSWER:

A variable with an ultimate allocatable component was not intended to
be allowed here. All the questions above involve such a component.

An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[181:22-24] 11.1.7.2 Form of the DO construct, C1128, first sentence,
    After "of finalizable type,"
    insert "shall not have an ultimate allocatable component,"
    making the whole constraint read

  "C1128 A variable-name that appears in a LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT
         locality-spec shall not have the ALLOCATABLE, INTENT (IN), or
         OPTIONAL attribute, shall not be of finalizable type, shall
         not have an allocatable ultimate component, shall not be a
         nonpointer polymorphic dummy argument, and shall not be a
         coarray or an assumed-size array. A variable-name that is not
         permitted to appear in a variable definition context shall
         not appear in a LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality-spec."
