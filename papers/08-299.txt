1. Introduction

This paper contains an interp request against Fortran 2003.
There are three possible answers (with different edits); these are
ranked beginning with the least restrictive going on to the most
restrictive.

Also, if the answer is anything other than the least restrictive we
should consider whether it should be less restrictive in Fortran 2008.
(I have not included any separate material for that process as it can
be mechanically derived from the interp request should that route be
followed.)

QUESTION:

Constraint C1279 says
  "In the scoping unit of an elemental subprogram, an object
   designator with a dummy argument as the base object shall not
   appear in a <specification-expr> except as the argument to one of
   the intrinsic functions BIT_SIZE, KIND, LEN, or the numeric inquiry
   functions (13.5.6)."

It has been stated in previous J3 papers that the reason for this
restriction is to ensure that every iteration of a single invocation
of an elemental procedure will have the same stack size: and this
desire was achieved in Fortran 95.

However, the situation changes with deferred-length character
components.  For example, with the type
  TYPE T
    CHARACTER(:),ALLOCATABLE :: CP
  END TYPE
and the elemental procedure
  SUBROUTINE ZAP(X)
    TYPE(T),INTENT(INOUT) :: x
    REAL WORK(LEN(X%CP))
    ...
and the variable
  TYPE(T) ARRAY(100)
initialized as
  DO I=1,100; ARRAY(I)%CP = REPEAT('x',I); END DO
then in the invocation
  CALL ZAP(ARRAY)
the invoked procedure will have a different size for its WORK array
for every element of ARRAY.  Thus the restriction no longer achieves
its aim (though this aim is not actually stated in the standard).

Is this restriction still correct and useful?  That is,
(a) is the above example standard-conforming,
(b) is the below example standard-conforming.

Program below_example
  Integer :: ARRAY(100) = (/ (I,I=1,100) /)
  Call ES(ARRAY)
  Print *,ARRAY
Contains
  Elemental Subroutine ES(X)
    Integer,Intent(Inout) :: X
    Real WORK(X)
    ...
  End Subroutine
End Program


DISCUSSION:

The purpose of the constraint was to facilitate the optimisation of moving
the loop traversal into the elemental procedure, and then hoisting the
stack frame setup outside the loop.  Few processors do this optimisation
right now.

In fact, even in the absence of the constraint the optimisation can still
be done for all the previously-valid cases: the analysis required is no
more complicated than the analysis the constraint requires for producing
the error message.


ANSWER:

Pick one of:

(1) It is not useful; this restriction no longer serves its purpose
    and should be removed.  An edit is supplied to make the second
    example standard-conforming.

(2) It might not be useful, but the standard is not in error and so
    the first example is standard-conforming but the second is not.

(3) The need to modify the constraint to achieve the desired result
    was inadvertantly overlooked: an edit is supplied to make the
    first example not conforming.


EDITS:

(1) [288:2-4] Delete constraint C1279.

(2) None.

(3) [288:4] Append to constraint C1279
    "The object designator shall not have a deferred length parameter."
