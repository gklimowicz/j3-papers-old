Subject: Interpretation request re sequence association

NUMBER: F03/0058
TITLE: Sequence association for character(kind=c_char)
KEYWORDS: sequence association, character(kind=c_char)
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

1. Is it intended that the sequence association rules for arguments
of type default character should also apply for arguments of type
character(kind=c_char)? There appears to be an inconsistency between
12.4.1.2, paras 2-3 [269:1-9] and 12.4.1.5 [272:5-17].

2. There appears also to be inconsistency as to whether the rules
apply to a dummy argument that is not assumed shape or to a dummy
argument that is either explicit shape or assumed size. Is this
intended?

ANSWER:

1. Yes.  Edits are supplied for 12.4.1.2.

2. The inconsistency was not intended and edits are supplied for 12.4.1.2.


EDITS:

Page and line numbers refer to 04-007.
