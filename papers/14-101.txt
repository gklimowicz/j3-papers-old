Subject:type-spec for ac-do-variable
Date: 2013 December 20

Reference: 10-007r1

Fortran 2008 added the ability to optionally specify the type of the
index-name directly in a forall-header (R752), allowing the
programmer to specify the type of this construct entity at the point
where it is created, rather than inheriting the type from the
enclosing scope. This applies to FORALL and DO CONCURRENT.

This feature was not also applied to the ac-do-variable in an array
constructor implied-DO (R473), which, as a statement entity it would
also benefit from the option of local type specification. This
omission creates an asymmetry in the language that should be corrected
in the next standard.

A similar case can be made for the data-i-do-variable in data-implied-do
(R537), which is also a statement entity.

Note that io-implied-do does not create a statement or construct entity,
so this issue does not apply there.

Suggested edits, in reference to 10-007r1, are provided to correct this
defect.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[84:42] 4.8, R473

Replace R473 with:

R473 ac-implied-do is ( ac-value-list, [type-spec ::]
                      ac-implied-do-control )

Alternatively, the optional type-spec could be added to R474, but the
edits to 16.4 are cleaner if it's R473.

Insert new constraint C4107a

C4107a (R473) type-spec in ac-implied-do shall specify type integer

Consider also qualifying the references to type-spec in C4103,
C4104 and C4105 (all for R469) so as to reduce possible confusion with
the different type-spec applying to R473.

[104:17-20], 5.4.7, R537

Replace R537 with:

R537 data-implied-do is ( data-i-do-object-list, [type-spec ::]
                        data-i-do-variable =
                        scalar-int-constant-expr,
                        scalar-int-constant-expr
                        [, scalar-int-constant-expr] )

Insert new constraint C568a

C568a (R537) type-spec shall specify type integer

[442:23-29] 16.4

Replace the second sentence of paragraph 4 with the following two
sentences:

It is a scalar variable. If type-spec appears in data-implied-do
or ac-implied-do, the variable has the specified type and type
parameters; otherwise it has the type and type parameters that
it would have if it were the name of a variable in the innermost
executable construct or scoping unit that includes the DATA
statement or array constructor, and this type shall be integer
type; it has no other attributes.
