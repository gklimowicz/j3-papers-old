Subject: UK-03 - RECL for unlimited records
Date: 2013 September 30

Requirements and rationale
--------------------------
   See N1975.

Specification
--------------
   Standardize the value that will be returned by INQUIRE RECL= for
   files connected for stream access, with a single value that will be
   returned by all processors.

Syntax
------
   The value shall be: HUGE(0), HUGE(0_INT64), -1, -2, or zero.
   (Straw vote)

Edits (relative to 10-007r1)
----------------------------
   [intro] Add a new extension description
   "The maximum record length reported by INQUIRE for a stream access
   file has been standardized."

   [239:11] In the description of the RECL= specifier of the INQUIRE
            statement, replace "the <<scalar-int-variable>> becomes
            undefined" by "the <<scalar-int-variable>> is set to the
            value HUGE(0) {or whatever is determined}".
   [455:30] Remove an item from the list of events that might cause a
            variable to become undefined by deleting ", RECL=,".
