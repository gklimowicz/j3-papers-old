Edits to WG5/N2056:
-------------------

DE1:[9:5] In 5.1 Team concepts, para 1, sentence 2, replace "both
sibling and ancestor" by "sibling or ancestor".

initialized" by "default-initialized".

list, delete the first sentence "The value of
<team-variable>...initial team."
{Redundant with the sentence that follows.}

DE5[11:13,17] In 5.4 Image selectors, after the constraint, para 1,
last sentence, and para 2, sentence 2, replace "an image index" by
"the image index".
{Note that the first sentence of f08:6.6 is "An image selector
determines the image index for a coindexed object.".}

JP3[16:20] In 6.4 STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, para 1, sentence 2, replace
"image image" by "image".

JP4[18:1] In 7.3 EVENT POST statement, in para 2 after the constraint,

event variable is processor dependent."
{This was added as a result of the initial JP4 comment.}

GB6[18:2-4] In 7.3 EVENT POST statement, delete the final paragraph.
{Effectively only says that actions that occur in unordered segments
are unordered.}

JP4[18:20+] In 7.4 EVENT WAIT statement, following the 3-item
list. insert a new paragraph: "If an error occurs during execution of
an EVENT WAIT statement, the value of the count of its event variable
is processor dependent."

JP7[27:17] In 8.4.15 EVENT_QUERY, in the description of COUNT, change

JP4[44:20+] In 9.11 Edits to annex A, add a new dependency: "the value
of the count of the event variable in an EVENT WAIT or EVENT POST
statement if an error condition occurs."
{This was added as a result of the initial JP4 comment.}
