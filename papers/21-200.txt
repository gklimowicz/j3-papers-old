Discussion
----------

An ALLOCATE statement for a non-coarray <allocate-object> that has a
coarray ultimate component is not an image control statement because
the coarray ultimate component will be unallocated. However, a
DEALLOCATE statement for such an object is an image control statement
because it might involve deallocation of the coarray ultimate component
on all the images, which would require synchronization. I think it would
be better for such a DEALLOCATE statement always to involve
synchronization and I include an edit for this. Without this change,
using coarray components of allocatable variables would be somewhat
error prone, as the user might not know whether there will be a
synchronisation without checking the allocation status of every coarray
component.


Edit to 21-007r2
-----------------


[147:3] In 9.7.3.2 Deallocation of allocatable variables, para 10, first
sentence, after "coarray" add "or an object with a coarray subobject"
to make the sentence read "When a statement that deallocates a coarray
or an object with a coarray subobject is executed, there is an implicit
synchronization of all active images in the current team."
