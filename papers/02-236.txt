Subject: Editorial ambiguity in SELECT CASE

The phrasing of C805 (160:30-31) in 02-007r2 is ambiguous.
In particular, it is unclear whether the "For character type"
condition applies to the whole rest of the sentence or just
to the clause about length differences.  I received an informal
interpretation request about the same phrasing on f95.
Although the requestor seemed satisfied with an informal answer,
we ought to at least remove the ambiguity in f2k.

The wording seems a little backwords anyway in that the important
part (the requirement that the character kinds be the same) is
tacked on with a "but" as an addendum to the part that could have
been omitted or relegated to a note (though the edit below
doesn't do so).  If we said nothing at all about the matter, that
omission would allow the character lengths to be different,
though it is arguably better to make the explicit statement.
The requirement on character kind, however, needs to be stated.

EDIT (to 02-007r2)

  [160:30-31] replace

    "For character type, length differences are allowed, but the
     kind type parameters shall be the same."

     with

    "For character type, the kind type parameters shall be the
     same; character length differences are allowed."
