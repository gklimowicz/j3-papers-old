Subject: Issue 63, FORM_TEAM synchronization
Reference: J3/06-007r1, J3/06-266


Discussion of issue 63 (page 380)

FORM_TEAM is a collective routine so that an implementation has the
option of performing operations that involve all the team members. For
example, the times for trial round trip messages to the other images
might be used to determine an optimal communication pattern for the
team.

SYNC_IMAGES involves a different form of synchronization. In particular,
the image sets may vary between the images involved. This may allow
better load balancing than would be possible with SYNC_TEAM.

None.
