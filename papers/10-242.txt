NUMBER: F03/0085
TITLE: Finalizing targets of pointer or allocatable actual arguments
KEYWORDS: Finalization, pointer actual argument, allocatable actual
          argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the program

program Finalize
  type :: T
    ...
  contains
    final :: ...
  end type T

  type(t), pointer :: TV
  allocate ( TV )
  call sub ( TV )
contains
  sub ( A )
    type(t), intent(out) :: A
  end sub A
end program Finalize

The eighth paragraph of 10-007, section 4.5.6.3 [76:30-31], says
 "When a procedure is invoked, a nonpointer, nonallocatable object that
  is an actual argument corresponding to an INTENT(OUT) dummy argument
  is finalized.''

Q1. Is the target of TV finalized when SUB is invoked?

Q2. If TV were allocatable instead of a pointer, would it be finalized?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes
A2. Yes

It was intended that an allocatable actual argument or the target of a
pointer actual argument that is associated with an INTENT(OUT) dummy
argument be finalized when the procedure is invoked.  Edits are provided
to correct the error.

EDITS: In 10-007

Replace the eighth paragraph of 4.5.6.3 [76:30-31] with:

 "When a procedure is invoked, an object that becomes argument associated
  with a nonpointer, nonallocatable INTENT(OUT) dummy argument of that
  procedure is finalized."
