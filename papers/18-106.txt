Subject: Constants and intrinsic functions

Discussion:


It appears that integration of the team feature into F2018 overlooked
a needed edit to the rules for constant expressions.

One of the options for a primary in a constant expression is:

"a reference to a standard intrinsic function that is
transformational, other than COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, NULL, NUM_IMAGES,
THIS_IMAGE, or TRANSFER, where each argument is a constant
expression,"

Considering the rationale for including THIS_IMAGE and NUM_IMAGES in
the list of exceptions, TEAM_NUMBER and GET_TEAM should also be
included.  Both of these functions allow use with no options, so the
last phrase is automatically satisfied in those cases.


Edits to N2146:

[Page 166] In 10.1.12 Constant Expression, paragraph 1, list item (6),
insert "GET_TEAM" and "TEAM_NUMBER" alphabetically in the list of
intrinsic functions for which references are not allowed in a constant
expression.

{Making the whole list item read:

(6) a reference to a standard intrinsic function that is
    transformational, other than COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, GET_TEAM,
    NULL, NUM_IMAGES, TEAM_NUMBER, THIS_IMAGE, or TRANSFER, where each
    argument is a constant expression,
}
