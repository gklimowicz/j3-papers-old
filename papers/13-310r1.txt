1. Requirements from 13-244r1
-----------------------------

  "Processors are required to have the ability to report the appearance
   of an intrinsic procedure not described in the standard.  Fortran
   2003 added intrinsic modules.  Processors are not required to report
   the use of non-standard intrinsic modules, nor of non-standard
   entities from standard intrinsic modules, or of non-standard use of
   standard intrinsic procedures.  Doing so would aid
   standards-conformance checking of programs."

2. Specifications
-----------------

That processors be required to be able to diagnose the use of nonstandard
intrinsic procedure or modules, and nonstandard procedures from a standard
intrinsic module.

3. Syntax
---------

No new syntax.


4. Edits to 10-007r1
--------------------

[xv Introduction p2+]

In the new list of new features, add

" o Intrinsic procedures and modules:
    A processor is required to report
    - use of an intrinsic procedure if the name is defined in Clause 13
      but reference is inconsistent with requirements in Clause 13,
    - use of intrinsic modules whose names are not defined in Clause 13,
      14 or 15,
    - use of a procedure from an intrinsic module, if the procedure name
      is not defined in Clause 13, 14 or 15, or reference is
      inconsistent with requirements in Clause 13, 14 or 15.
"

[23:27 1.5.2p2(7)] Replace
    "intrinsic procedures whose names are not defined in Clause; and"
  with
    "a nonstandard intrinsic procedure (including one with the same
     name as a standard intrinsic procedure but with different
     requirements);".

[23:27+ 1.5.2p2(7+)] Insert list items

" (7a) it contains the capability to detect and report the use within a
       submitted program unit of a nonstandard intrinsic modules;

  (7b) it contains the capability to detect and report the use within a
       submitted program unit of a procedure from a standard intrinsic
       module, if the procedure is not defined by \thisstd{} or the
       procedure has different requirements from those specified by
       \thisstd{}; and".
