1. Discussion

Recovering from stalled images requires certain clean-up operations to
be performed prior to transferring control to the END TEAM.  On each
level of the call stack certain allocated arrays must be deallocated,
and in the case of allocatable coarrays, without the usual
synchronization.  Finalizers for all objects that go out of scope must
also be invoked.


2. Edits to N2027

[14:7] After "construct" (moved to the new 5.9 by paper 14-250r2)
insert "after execution of all finalizations and deallocations that
would have occurred during the normal completion of active procedures
called within the CHANGE TEAM block, without synchronization of
coarray deallocations."
