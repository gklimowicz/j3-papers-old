Introduction
============
The /data subgroup has discussed and voted on those items
identified by the electronic subgroup as requirements, as given
in paper N1251.  All items which gained an average priority value
of 1.0, or higher, and which are not already being worked on by
X3J3 were considered for inclusion in the list.

This paper summarizes the results of those votes for Category-1 and
Category-3 items only; details of Category-2 items are included in
a separate document.


Requirements for Inclusion into Fortran 2000
============================================
The /data subgroup believes the following should be requirements
for Fortran 2000:

   1.1.9  Aliasing Type Definitions (Repos. #11)
          Allow programmers to use one type name as an alias for
          another.

   1.4.1  Allow PUBLIC entities of PRIVATE type (Repos. #75)

   1.4.3  Separate specification of the access attribute of derived
          type components  (data-E4)
          Remove the restriction that either all or none of the
          components of a derived type have to be public or private.

   3.2    Regularize KIND parameterization intrinsics (Repos. #57)
          2. SELECTED_INT_KIND and SELECTED_REAL_KIND operate with
             radix 10. Introduce an optional, default integer parameter
             RADIX to allow kind selection with different radix, like
             radix <r> or radix <q>

   3.4    Extend ALLOCATE to specify non-KIND type parameters (Repos. #72)
          Extend the ALLOCATE statement to allow specification
          of type parameters. Allow POINTER or ALLOCATABLE to be used with
          declaration forms used to 'assume' type parameters.
