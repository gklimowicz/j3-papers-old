DEFECT TYPE: TBD
STATUS: TDB

QUESTION:

Is it intentional that final subroutines with coarray dummy arguments
are allowed?

Note that C482 does not allow to have two subroutines with a dummy
argument of the same rank where one is a coarray and the other not.
For elemental subroutines, C1289 prohibits the use of coarrays.


WG5/N1830 has:

C480 (R452) A final-subroutine-name shall be the name of a module
            procedure with exactly one dummy argument. That argument
            shall benonoptional and shall be a nonpointer,
            nonallocatable, nonpolymorphic variable of the derived type
            being defined. All length type parameters of the dummy
            argument shall be assumed.  The dummy argument shall not
            have the INTENT (OUT) or VALUE attribute.

C482 (R452) A final subroutine shall not have a dummy argument
            with the same kind type parameters and rank as the dummy
            argument of another final subroutine of that type.

C1289 All dummy arguments of an elemental procedure shall be scalar
      noncoarray dummy data objects and shall not have the POINTER or
      ALLOCATABLE attribute.


ANSWER:

No. A edit is supplied to correct this.


EDITS:

In C480 in the second sentence, add "noncoarray," before "nonpointer".
