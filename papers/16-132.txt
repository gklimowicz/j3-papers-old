Subject:    Descriptions of elemental BESSEL_JN and BESSEL_YN are wrong
Reference:  16-007

1. Introduction
===============

The descriptions of the result characteristics of BESSEL_JN and
BESSEL_YN are incorrect for the elemental cases.

Does this need to be corrected by an interp?

The shape of the result of an elemental function is scalar.  The shape
of the result of applying an elemental function elementally is
adequately described in 12.8.2.  Clause 13 does not describe the result
of applying any other elemental intrinsic function.  If we must specify
the shape in the elemental cases for BESSEL_JN and BESSEL_YN, it's not
the same as X.  It's the same as N if N is an array, else the same as X.
