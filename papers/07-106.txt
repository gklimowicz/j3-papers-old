1.  Allow internal procedures in generics (since their interfaces are
explicit).

[301:24] Insert "internal procedures," before "or".

[303:17] Insert "internal procedures," before "or".

2.  Allow entry names in generics in the same subprogram in which they
    define procedures.

This appears not to be prohibited.
