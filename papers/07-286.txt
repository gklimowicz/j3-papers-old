Subject: Description of Kind Value Arrays
Date: 2007 October 06

The arrays with kind parameter values for characters and logicals
were supposed to be sorted by increasing storage size, so the first
element would be the smallest sized kind available.

The existing language neglects this point.

Edits are supplied to correct this oversight.

Edits: (07-007r3)

[427:25-26] Replace "The order of the values is processor dependent."
by "The order is by non-decreasing storage size of the kinds supported.
When two kinds have the same storage size, the order is processor
dependent."

[430:3-4] Replace "The order of the values is processor dependent."
by "The order is by non-decreasing storage size of the kinds supported.
When two kinds have the same storage size, the order is processor
dependent."
