From:    Van Snyder
To:      J3
Subject: Nomination of emeritus members
Date: 2007 October 26

The following former J3 members have served ten years or more, and
have expressed an interest to be nominated as emeritus members.

They understand that this allows to participate in J3 discussions, both
by e-mail and in person if they choose to attend meetings, but it does
not confer voting privileges.  If they choose to re-join J3, they lose
their emeritus status, and would need to be nominated again at a later
date if they wish to reinstate emeritus status.
