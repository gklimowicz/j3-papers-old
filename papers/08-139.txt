  /WG5

    John Reid opened the WG5 meeting at 8:00 AM.  The minutes for
    the WG5 meeting are in WG5 paper N1715.  Included throughout
    these J3 minutes are summaries of WG5 decisions that directly
    affect subsequent J3 activities.

  /J3

    The J3 meeting (#183) was called to order at 9:40 AM, Sunday,
    February 10, 2008, at the Emerald Suites, Las Vegas, NV, USA,
    by the J3 chair, Dan Nagle.

    The minutes for all of Sunday and Monday morning are from Bill
    Long's notes.  Any errors or omissions are from the secretary.

1.1 Opening business                             D. Nagle

    The Chairman welcomed everyone.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair                     D. Nagle

    Dan said the major work for this meeting was to resolve UTIs
    (Unresolved Technical Issues), answer interpretations, and, as
    part of WG5, decide the coarray content of F2008.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda                         D. Nagle

** motion: Adopt the agenda as amended (moved by Van Snyder/
           seconded by Bill Long): passed by unanimous consent
           {uc}

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 182 minutes            D. Nagle

** motion: Approve paper 07-343r1, aka 08-100r1, the minutes of
           meeting #182 as amended (Snyder/Long): uc

1.1.4 INCITS/SDB report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    Dan reports that we have been reorganized as a "technical
    group".  We are now PL22.3.  The effect is that PL22 has to
    approve any action by J3, until we get authority to act as
    before.

1.1.5 OWG-V report (if any)                      D. Nagle

    From N1715: Dan Nagle reported that very good progress was being
    made. There was a new draft available covering three main points:
    safety, security, and computer reliability. They are looking at
    floating point and parallel programming issues.

1.1.6 ISO/WG5 report                             Van Snyder, IR

    From N1715, John Reid's SC22 report N1703:

    There are no problems with producing further corrigenda (WG5
    ballot underway, J3 ballot soon to finish).

    The TRs on Exceptions and Allocatables will be withdrawn at the
    SC22 level.

    Regarding the Interoperability TR, John Reid noted that he should
    not have applied for formal approval at the 2006 meeting of SC22
    since the clock starts ticking immediately. An extension gives 18
    months from Sept 2007.  The first draft will be ready Feb/March
    2009 (Bill Long Editor).

    A request for a delay of 10 months for the main standard was
    accepted by SC22.

    The next WG5 meeting is a joint meeting with J3 in Tokyo in
    November, 2008.

1.1.7 J11 Liaison report (if any)                C. Rasmussen

    From N1715: C: The committee is producing new revision which
    will standardise p-threads.  The UPC group was unsuccessful
    in its approach to get UPC into the C standard. They were
    pursuing a fast track separate standard.

1.1.8 H2 Liaison report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    Nothing new to report.

1.1.9 IEEE 754 report (if any)                   M. Ingrassia

    The draft 1.4.0 ballot was stopped;  there are many technical
    issues to resolve.  There will be a new ballot group formed.

1.1.10 Treasurer's report                         V. Snyder

    The ending balance at the previous meeting was $3126.45 .

    The is no meeting fee for meeting 183.

    J3 is divided into its usual three subgroups, /JOR, /DATA, and

      08-006A is the latest list of open interps, through F03/0109
      from m182.  It is missing F03/0110 from m182.  That will be in
      08-006Ar1 after m183.

      Interp letter ballot #15 is in paper 08-101 – that letter ballot
      closes tomorrow, 10-Feb, and not everyone has voted.  Stan will
      provide a summary and status of the interps voted upon at m183.

1.3 Subgroup meetings (10:18 AM)

  /WG5

    There were presentations and much debate about how much of
    coarrays should be in F2008:

      - N1710 - Jim Xia (Canada) suggested coarrays be made smaller
      - N1712 - David Muxworthy (UK) suggested coarrays be pulled
        out of F2008 into a separate TR
      - N1706 - Makki Takata (Japan) suggested coarrays be pulled
        out of part 1 of F2008 and be published as a separate part.
        A part can be translated and bid but a TR cannot.
      - Van Snyder (US) suggested that coarrays should remain in
        F2008 as is.

1.4 Subgroup reports (4:30 PM)

  /JOR

    The UTI for the new feature laundry list at beginning of 08-007
    has been given to /JOR.

  /J3

    The list of papers for voting, discussion, or action later in
    the week was discussed.

  Recessed at 4:45 PM


2. Monday, February 11, 2008  8:00 AM
-------------------------------------

  /WG5

    From N1715:

    WG5 moved to consider item J3-038 (math functions) of the
    Repository, N1649. Dan Nagle proposed that the work item
    be deleted.

      Straw Vote {SV}: Shall we eliminate item J3-038 (math
                       functions) completely?
                       Yes: 1 No: 6 Undecided: 10

                       John Reid concluded that WG5 wanted the
                       item to remain. It would be up to J3 to
                       decide how to implement it (intrinsics
                       or module or something else).

    There were more lengthy coarray discussions - consensus was
    not reached.

  /J3 at 10:08 AM

2.1 F2008 Plenary (00-010)                        Subgroup Heads

    There were no papers upon which to vote.  The USTAG will caucus.

2.2 Tutorials (if needed) - none

2.3 Subgroup meetings (10:15 AM)

2.4 Subgroup reports (4:30 PM)

  /WG5

    The US suggested a compromise position on coarrays: leave the
    core definition of coarrays in F2008 and move certain,
    controversial coarray features {eg, teams, synchronize team,
    collectives, notify query} to a TR.

  /J3

    The list of papers for voting, discussion, or action later in
    the week was discussed.

  Recessed at 5:00 PM

3.1 F2008 Plenary                                 Subgroup Heads

  /WG5

    From N1715: Following some [debate}, John Reid declared that
    the best way forward (the way that would achieve the greatest
    consensus) would be to follow the US's revised position [keep
    core features of coarrays in the main standard and develop a
    TR to cater for the other features plus possibly those
    suggested by public comment]. John Reid asked for any
    objections to this and none were forthcoming.

    It was left to the HPC subgroup to produce a paper detailing
    the features of coarrays that would be included in the standard
    and those that would go into the TR.

        format, margins?
      - 08-018 "Interpretation Update Pages" and 08-121 "Draft
        Interpretation Pages": note strikethrough and wavy

  /J3 at 4:40 PM

  /WG5

    N1693 from m181 is the F2008 schedule.  The suggestion is that
    there be a 15 day WG5 ballot when the 08-007r1 exists.  A
    subcommittee of Malcolm Cohen, Dan Nagle, and John Reid will do
    a last minute check.  A US public comment in May-July, 2008, will
    allow J3 to formulate its position at the August J3 meeting for
    the ISO public comment that ends in Sep-2008.  WG5 could process
    the comments at the Tokyo meeting in Nov-2008.

5.5 Subgroup reports (4:23 pm)

  /WG5

    A discussion was held about whether or not the VALUE attribute
    should be allowed on OPTIONAL arguments in BIND(C) routines.
    Currently it is not allowed.  Should the Interop TR allow it?
    The reason to allow it was for completeness and usefulness.  The
    reason to disallow it is that some F2003 implementations flag
    a missing OPTIONAL argument by passing a 0 by value.  These
    implementations could not represent a present optional argument
    with a 0 value passed by value.  No conclusion was reached.
