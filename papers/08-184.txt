Subject: Minor fix for CMPLX
Date: 2008 May 14

Dick Hendrickson reported a problem in the definition of the CMPLX
intrinsic.  In F2008 08-007r2 page 336, 13.7.34, paragraph 5 says

  Result Value. If Y is absent and X is not complex, it is as if Y
  were present with the value zero. If X is complex, it is as if X
  were real with the value REAL (X, KIND) and Y were present with
  the value AIMAG (X, KIND).

AIMAG (page 326, 13.7.8) does not have a KIND argument.

Edit:

Page 336, 13.7.34, paragraph 5, change "AIMAG (X, KIND)" to
"REAL (AIMAG (X), KIND)"
