NUMBER: JP-16
TITLE: Multiple occurrence of namelist-group-name in NAMELIST
       statement
KEYWORDS: namelist
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

JP-16)

  5.4 2nd paragraph after R545 and constraints (Page 66  Line 11)
  states that:

  "Any namelist-group-name may occur in  more than one NAMELIST
   statement in a scoping unit."

  Can a namelist-group-name occur more than once in one NAMELIST
  statement ?

  Is the following NAMELIST statement standard conforming ?

     NAMELIST /NLIST/ A, B   /NLIST/ C, D

  If this is standard conforming, is it the same as the
  following ?

     NAMELIST /NLIST/ A, B, C, D

ANSWER:

  Yes, the rules should be analogous to those for named common
  blocks at [69:16-19].

EDIT:

[66:11]  Replace "in more than one NAMELIST statement" by "more than
         once in the NAMELIST statements"
