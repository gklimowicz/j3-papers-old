Here is a draft response for F03/0030, with thanks to Malcolm Cohen
for his help.

NUMBER:  F03/0030
TITLE:  IEEE divide by zero
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, divide-by-zero
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum 
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

Is infinity / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?
Is NaN / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?

Fortran 2003 defines (in 14.2) infinity / zero and NaN / zero
cases as IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO.  IEEE-754 defines (in 6.1 and 6.2)
those two as unexceptional.

ANSWER:

On an IEEE-conformant processor, these cases do not raise exceptions 
(see clauses 6.1 and 6.2 of IEEE-754).

The definitions in 14.2 were intended to describe IEEE exceptions with
sufficient latitude to allow use on near-IEEE and non-IEEE machines.
However, the definition of IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO is not consistent with
the IEEE International Standard.

Furthermore, the definition of the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag is also not
consistent with the IEEE standard, because this exception is not 
raised for operations on infinite operands.

Edits are provided to fix these inconsistencies.

EDITS:

Page and line numbers refer to 04-007.

[365:13-15] Clause 14.2, lines 3 and 5. After "assignment" add 
"with finite operands", twice.

[365:18] Clause 14.2, line 8.  Change "nonzero numerator" to 
"finite nonzero numerator".
