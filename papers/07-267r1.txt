NUMBER: F03/0097
TITLE: Blanks as separators in NAMELIST input
KEYWORDS: Namelist input, blanks, separators
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:
1)  Was in intended that blanks be allowed as separators in Namelist
Input?

Consider a namelist input fragment:

              I = 3              J = 4

Page 243:5 says that namelist value separators are the same as list
directed value separators.  Page 239:7 says those value separators are
"...blanks between values" and then defines what the values are.  The
"J" above isn't a value, so the blanks aren't separators and the
fragment is illegal for namelist input

2)  Is there a similar problem with namelist comments as in this
fragment?
              I = 3           !  this is a namelist comment


ANSWER:

1)  Yes, it was intended to allow blanks as separators for namelist
input.  Edits are supplied to correct the wording in the standard

2)  Yes, there is a similar problem with comments.  The fragment is 
intended to be legal.  The edits correct the error.

EDITS:

[243:5] Replace the paragraph by
  "A value separator for list-directed formatting (10.9) is also a
   value separator for namelist formatting.  In addition, one or more
   contiguous blanks between the a nonblank value and a following
   object designator or "!" comment initiator is a value separator."
