TITLE: SAVE attribute and EQUIVALENCE
KEYWORDS: SAVE, EQUIVALENCE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meetinh

QUESTION:

If one object in an EQUIVALENCE set has the SAVE attribute, do all the
other objects in the EQUIVALENCE set implicitly have the SAVE attribute?
This can be detected by the program:

  SUBROUTINE s1
     TYPE T
       SEQUENCE
       REAL :: C = 3.0
     END TYPE
     TYPE(t) x,y
     SAVE x
     EQUIVALENCE(x,y)
     x = t(1.0)
     RETURN
  ENTRY s2
     PRINT *,y  ! Does this print 1.0 or 3.0?
  END
  PROGRAM show
    CALL s1
    CALL s2
  END

If Y has the SAVE attribute the program will print 1.0;
if not, it will print 3.0 due to the default initialization.

ANSWER:

Yes, the SAVE attribute propagates through EQUIVALENCE.
An edit is supplied to clarify this.

EDIT:

[97:7+] Insert new paragraph
  "If any data object in an <equivalence-set> has the SAVE attribute,
   all other objects in the <equivalence-set> have the SAVE attribute;
   this may be confirmed by explicit specification."
