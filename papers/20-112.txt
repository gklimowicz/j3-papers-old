OpenACC Liaison Report
======================

Information about OpenACC, including the current standard document,
training materials, and upcoming events can be found at
http://www.openacc.org/.

The current OpenACC standard is version 3.0. It includes the following
changes beyond version 2.7:
1. Allows for hosts that share some memory with the device but not all
   memory.
2. Allows an implementation that treats a multicore CPU as a device,
   either an additional device or the only device.
3. Added an "if" clause to "init", "shutdown", "set", "wait" directives.
4. Added a "devnum" modifier to the "wat" directive to specify a
   device to which the operation applies.
5. Allowed a "routine" directive to include a C++ lambda name, or to
   appear before a C++ lambda definition.
6. Added runtime API "acc_memcpy_d2d" for copying data directly between
   two device arrays on the same or different devices.
7. Many clarifications and refinements of the semantics for clauses.

Version 3.0 of the OpenACC specification was adopted November 2019.
The specification can be found at https://www.openacc.org/specification.


EuroLLVM will have a lightning talk by Valentin Clement and Jeff
Vetter (both of Oak Ridge National Lab) on "OpenACC MLIR dialect for
Flang and maybe more".

There are over 200 applications in production or development using
OpenACC, including:
    - Code LEO (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
    - NekCEM (Computational Electromagnetics)
    - INCOMP3d (3D incompressible Navier-Stokes solver)
    - Cloverleaf
    - MAESTRO and CASTRO (modeling stellar explosions)
    - LSDalton (quantum chemistry)
And the usual suspects:
    - Gaussian 16
    - ANSYS Fluent
    - VASP
    - MPAS-A
    - COSMO
    - GAMERA for GPU
    - Quantum Espresso

More information on these can be found on the OpenACC
web site at https://www.openacc.org/success-stories.

There are more "hackathons" coming up in 2020, where researchers
bring their codes to work alongside with OpenACC experts to
accelerate their applications. Event dates are posted at
https://www.openacc.org/events.
