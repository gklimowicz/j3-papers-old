Subject: Issue 126

Fix some grammar and resolve issue 126.

Edits:

169: 41 Change "previously ... remembered" to "written since the file was created"

168:41+ Add a note:
Note 9.7+
There may be some character positions in the file which do not correspond
to characters written because on some processors, a newline character may
be written to the file as a carriage-return/line-feed or other sequence.
The portable means of  determining a position in a file is via the POS= specifier
in an INQUIRE statement (9.8.1.16).
