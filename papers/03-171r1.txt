From:     Richard Maine
Subject:  Editorial proposals

I.  Previously passed edits

  The following edits have been passed by J3 as part of the US
  position and then passed from WG5 back to J3.  We've probably
  looked at them enough, compared to other work on the table.
  It is therefore proposed to do the edits.

  The edits in 03-107r1 sections 1.1-1.18 except for 1.3 and 1.4
  Also the edits in 03-107r2 section 2.4.

  Omit the following edits
    section 1.2, edit for 19:5 (CD is correct)
    section 1.16, edit for 418:26 (CD is correct)
    section 1.11, edit for 253:20,21 (need for this questioned)

  Change the following edits
    section 1.1, edit on pg xiii, item (11).  Do the following instead
      Delete only the material in parens;
      First "and" -> ","
      "and access to" -> "and"      

  Explanation of why these sections and not others:
      1.3 needs reconcoliation with paper 03-166
      1.4 needs reconcoliation with deleting typealias
      1.12 and 1.14 were separately voted by wg5, but then accepted.
      1.19 has been objected to, so probably needs separate treatment
      1.20 UK version instead.
      1.21 reconcile edits with UK TC2

II. Edits for online viewing

  It is proposed that the edits described in J3/02-299 be
  incorporated into the next 007 draft.  Those edits are not
  detailed here because they do not affect the monochrome paper
  document at all.  They are edits to the underlying LaTeX that
  have the effect of

   1. Turning off coloration in the Annexes.

   2. Providing an option to turn off the gray backgrounds for
      notes (defaulted to the same appearance as now).

   3. Making links in the contents and index "live" for
      interactive viewing.

III. Annex D

  Section 2.6 of 03-107r2 proposes to add a BNF xref to the end of
  Annex D.  That needs some other slight changes to fit in well.
  It either needs to be a separate Annex or it needs a section
  heading under Annex D.  I propose the following edits

  [493] Change the Annex title from "Index of syntax rules"
        to just "Syntax rules".  (It isn't an index)
  [xiv] Correspondingly change the Annex title there.
  [493] Add a subclause heading for all the existing material
        "D.1 Extract of all Syntax rules"
  [531] Add a subclause heading at the end for the new material
        "D.2 Syntax rule cross reference"
  [531] Add the bnf xrefs as described in 03-107r2 section 2.6

  Exact edits for the bnf xrefs themselcves are not listed here
  because they are automatically generated.  See the sample in paper
  02-256, except that the script provided puts the defining R number
  to the left of the name instead of in parens to the right.  In cases
  where a BNF term has no R number because it is defined by an
  implicit rule, the defining R number is replaced by a long dash.
