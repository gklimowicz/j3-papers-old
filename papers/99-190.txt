QUESTION:

Is padding allowed in storage sequences?

Consider the common block

      CHARACTER C
      INTEGER I
      COMMON /CBLK/ C, I

Is padding allowed between the variables
C and I?

Consider the sequence type

      TYPE T
        SEQUENCE
        CHARACTER C
        INTEGER I
      END TYPE

Is padding allowed between component C
and component I?

ANSWER:

Padding between storage units is allowed unless
those storage units are explicitly required to be
contiguous in Section 14.6.3.1 or they are
required to be contiguous in order to satisfy the
storage association rules given in
Sections 14.6.3.2 and 14.6.3.3.

Discussion:

A user recently complained that Sun f90 adds pad
for alignment to sequence types and common blocks.
He asserted that the Fortran standard forbids
padding storage sequences.

I have tested seven different implementations, and
I found that all but one use padding in the
examples given.

The user based his assertion on the text of
Section 14.6.3.1 of the Fortran 95 standard.
He claimed the statements

   (7)  A nonpointer scalar object of sequence
        type occupies a sequence of storage
        sequences corresponding to the sequence
        of its ultimate components

and

   The order of the storage units in such a
   composite storage sequence is that of the
   individual storage units in each of the
   constituent storage sequences taken in
   succession, ignoring any zero-sized
   constituent sequences.

made his case.  I pointed out that where the
standard intends to require storage units to
be contiguous, it uses the word "contiguous."
He was not satisfied by that answer.

The user pointed out that the definition of the
size of a storage sequence supports his assertion.
He claimed that the size of the common block
given above is one character storage unit plus
one numeric storage unit, and that that is the
as the size of the common block

      INTEGER J
      CHARACTER D
      COMMON /CBLK/ J, D

which Sun f90 does not pad.  While that arithmetic
of sizes makes sense, I have been told informally
by a committee member that that was not the intent
of the committee.  Note 5.33 lends support to his
statement.

I have been unable to find any for the first
paragraph of Note 5.33 in the normative part of the
standard.

             and Section 14.6.3.

EDITS:

I suggest moving the first paragraph of Note 5.33
to the normative part of the standard.  I tried
to provide a definition of addition of sizes of
different storage units that would imply the
effect stated in Note 5.33, but I failed.
