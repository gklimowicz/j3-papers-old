1. Introduction

The description of construct association in 16.5.1.6 has not been updated
to adequately describe SELECT RANK.  Edits are provided.

2. Edits

[494:6] 16.5.1.6 Construct association, p1,
        Before "SELECT TYPE" insert "SELECT RANK or",
        making that sentence read
  "Execution of a SELECT RANK or SELECT TYPE statement establishes an
   association between the selector and the associate name of the
   construct."

[494:9-12] Turn paras 2 and 3 into bullets in a new para 2 by adding a new
  opening sentence and changing "If the" to "If a" twice, as follows:
  "In an ASSOCIATE or SELECT RANK construct, the following rules apply.
    - If a selector is allocatable, it shall be allocated; the associate
      name is associated with the data object and does not have the
      ALLOCATABLE attribute.
    - If a selector has the POINTER attribute, it shall be associated; the
      associate name is associated with the target of the pointer and does
      not have the POINTER attribute.".

[494:13-15] Leave as is; this cannot apply to SELECT RANK but is harmless.

[494:16-18] Leave as is; this applies to SELECT RANK.

[506:14] 16.6.7, item (11),
  "SELECT TYPE or ASSOCIATE" -> "ASSOCIATE, SELECT RANK, or SELECT TYPE".
