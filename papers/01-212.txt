1. Introduction

Issue 317 says:
  "the derived type assignment fix of paper 01-147r1 fails to fix the
   case of allocatable derived type components"

This is true but inadvertant.  Edits are supplied to fix this.

2. Edits to 01-007r1

[136:5] after "using"
        insert "defined assignment if the declared type of the component
                has a type-bound defined assignment consistent with the
                component, and"
        before "." insert "otherwise".

{This makes the whole sentence read:
  "The value of the component of <expr> is then assigned to the
corresponding
   component of <variable> using defined assignment if the declared type of
   the component has a type-bound defined assignment consistent with the
   component, and intrinsic assignment for the dynamic type of that
   component otherwise."}

{NB: A type-bound defined assignment need not be consistent with the
 component - e.g. if there is only a scalar (non-elemental) assignment
 provided and the component is an array.  In this case we require intrinsic
 assignment to be done instead, just as for variable.}
