Discussion:

In [278:2] we say that a dummy procedure is dummy argument that is
declared to be a procedure or "appears in a procedure reference".  A
literal reading of the current wording makes a dummy argument that
later appears as an actual argument a dummy procedure. We really mean
"appears as the procedure designator in a procedure reference".

Edit to 09-007r2:

[278:2] In the first line of "12.2.2.3 Dummy Procedures":

Replace "appears in a procedure reference" with "appears as the
procedure designator in a procedure reference".
