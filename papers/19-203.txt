1 Introduction

Addition of the degree trigonometric functions was given specifications
in m218, during which 19-145r2 was passed.  This paper makes minor
corrections and proposes edits. 

2 Specifications

These elemental intrinsics are generic and not specific.   
All would be similar to their radian counterparts except that the 
argument(s) or return values would be in degrees.

3 Syntax

    ACOSD (X)
    Description: Arccosine (inverse cosine) function in degrees.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Argument: X shall be of type real with a value that satisfies the 
              inequality |X| <= 1.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to arccos(X). The result is expressed in degrees
    and lies in the range of 0 to 180.

    ASIND (X)
    Description: Arcsine (inverse sine) function in degrees.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Argument: X shall be of type real with a value that satisfies the 
              inequality |X| <= 1.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to arcsin(X). The result is expressed in degrees
    and lies in the range -90 to 90.  


    ATAND (X) or ATAND (Y,X) 
    Description: Arctangent (inverse tangent) function in degrees.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Arguments: 
     Y     shall be of type real.
     X     If Y appears, X shall be of type real with the same kind type
           parameter as Y. If Y has the value zero, X shall not have the
           value zero. If Y does not appear, X shall be of type real.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X
    Result Value: If Y appears, the result is the same as the result of
    ATAN2D (Y, X). If Y does not appear, the result has a value equal
    to a processor-dependent approximation to arctan(X) and lies in the
    range -90 to 90.

    ATAN2D (Y,X) 
    Description: Arctangent (inverse tangent) function in degrees.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Arguments: 
     Y     shall be of type real.
     X     X shall be of the same type and kind type
           parameter as Y. If Y has the value zero, X shall not have the
           value zero. 
    Result Characteristics: Same as X
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to arctan(Y/X) if X != 0; it lies in the range
    -180 to 180. If Y > zero, the result is positive. If Y < zero, the
    result is negative. If Y = zero, the result is Y (if X > zero),
    approximately 180 (if X < zero and Y is positive real zero or the
    processor does not distinguish between positive and negative real
    zero) or approximately -180 (if Y is negative real zero). If
    X = zero, the absolute value of the result is approximately 90.

    COSD (X)
    Description: Cosine function in degrees.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Argument: X shall be of type real, regarded as a value in degrees.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to cos(X).

    SIND (X)
    Description: Sine function in degrees.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Argument: X shall be of type real, regarded as a value in degrees.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to sin(X).

    TAND (X)
    Description: Tangent function in degrees.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Argument: X shall be of type real, regarded as a value in degrees.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to tan(X).
