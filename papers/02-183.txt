The suggestion is to change the type parameter inquiry to use "?"
instead of "%".  This makes it obvious that something different
is happening and avoids confusion when there are several types
available and some the use the same term but sometimes as a
component name and sometimes as a parameter.  Perhaps that's
poor coding style, but not everybody has complete control over
the insides of the types they use.

Proposal.

Page 106:6, change to
R615       type-parem-inquiry     is      designator ? type-parem-name

If this is accepted, we'll need to make a pass through the examples
to make sure all of the type parameter inquiries are changed.
