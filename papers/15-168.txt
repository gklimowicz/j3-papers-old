Subject:   "at least four" mostly doesn't make sense
From:      Van Snyder
Reference: 15-007r1
Date: 2015 June 07

1. Introduction
===============

It doesn't make any sense that the LENGTH and STATUS arguments to the
GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, and GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE intrinsic
subroutines, and the CMDSTAT argument to the EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE intrinsic
subroutine, require at least four digits.

The VALUES argument to the DATE_AND_TIME intrinsic subroutine makes
sense because the year is assigned to the first element.
