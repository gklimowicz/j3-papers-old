[132:12] 9.4.4 Complex parts, p1,
         After "those of designator"
         insert ", which can be an array or scalar".
{Make blindingly obvious %RE and %IM can operate on arrays.}

[206:34] 11.6.2 Segments, p3, first bullet in list
  After "variable is defined" insert "or becomes undefined", making that
  whole bullet point read:
    "if a variable is defined on an image in a segment, it shall not be
     referenced, defined, or become undefined in a segment on another
     image unless the segments are ordered,"
{Forbid race condition between one image referencing a variable and
 another image making that variable become undefined.}

[209:0+whatever] De-hyperlink "image"/"images" in comments in NOTE 11.38.
{Already hyperlinked in surrounding text, not needed in these comments.}

[272:14] 13.7.2.3.2 F editing, p3,
         "hexadecimal-significant" -> "hexadecimal-significand".
{Fix typo.}

[throughout] Hyperlink as many more intrinsic procedures in examples and
             text as can reasonably be done.
{Currently very inconsistent.}
