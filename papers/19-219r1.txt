From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: J3 Fortran interp letter ballot #35 - due 30-Sep-2019
Date: 2019-September-01

Enclosed in the next letter ballot on Fortran interpretations.

This is a formal letter ballot; only one vote per principal member.
An alternate member may vote if the principal member does not vote;
in any case, comments are welcome from non-voting alternates and from
members of WG5 that are not J3 members, and will be taken into
consideration by J3/interp.

The rules for interpretation handling by which we operate say:

    o   J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority
        vote marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

    o   Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter
        ballot to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed
        by J3 meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  An interp
        answer passes by a 2/3rds vote;  a no vote must be accompanied
        by an explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's
        vote to yes.

        J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for
        more study even if the answer passes.


15 Fortran interpretations are currently "Passed by J3 meeting" after
J3 meeting #219.  This is the letter ballot phase to go from "Passed
by J3 meeting" to "Passed by J3 letter ballot".

** This letter ballot period is lengthened slightly to avoid finishing
** on a weekend.

The following Fortran interpretations are being balloted:

NUMBER: F18/001
TITLE: ACOSH principal value specification is wrong
KEYWORDS: ACOSH
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Clause 16.9.5 ACOSH( X ) p5 Result Value has:
    "If the result is complex the imaginary part is expressed in
     radians and lies in the range 0 <= AIMAG (ACOSH (X)) <= {pi}".

There is general agreement that the principal value of ACOSH should
have the real part non-negative which means the imaginary part must
range from -pi to +pi.

Is this a mistake in the definition of ACOSH?

ANSWER:

Yes, this is a mistake.  Edits are included to correct this error.
This will be an incompatibility with Fortran 2008.

EDITS to 18-007r1:

[26:17+] 4.3.3 Fortran 2008 compatibility, p10+, insert new para
         "Fortran 2008 required ACOSH of a complex value to have the
          imaginary part non-negative and had no requirement on
          the real part.  This document requires ACOSH of a complex
          value to have a non-negative real part and has no such
          requirement on the imaginary part."

[340:34-35] 16.9.5 ACOSH, p5 Result Value,
            after "is complex"
            insert "the real part is non-negative and",
            change "range 0" to "range $-\pi$".
Making the whole p5 read
    "Result Value. The result has a value equal to a processor-
     dependent approximation to the inverse hyperbolic cosine
     function of X. If the result is complex the real part is non-
     negative, and the imaginary part is expressed in radians and
     lies in the range $-\pi$ <= AIMAG (ACOSH (X)) <= $\pi$."

TITLE:  Internal procedures in generic interface blocks
KEYWORDS: Internal procedure, generic interface block
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

An internal procedure is allowed in a GENERIC statement, but
apparently it cannot appear in a generic interface block.

Section 15.4.3.4.1 (12.4.3.4.1 in F2008) Generic identifiers p1 states
  "A generic interface block specifies a generic interface for each 
   of the procedures in the interface block.  The PROCEDURE statement
   lists procedure pointers, external procedures, dummy procedures, 
   or module procedures that have this generic interface."

Is the apparent prohibition of internal procedures in the PROCEDURE
statement intended?

ANSWER: 

No, this was not intended.  An internal procedure should be allowed
in a generic interface body. An edit is provided to correct this
mistake.

DISCUSSION:

In F2003, Section 12.3.2.1 Interface Block has rule R1206

   <procedure-stmt>    is [MODULE] PROCEDURE <procedure-name-list>

with constraint C1270

    "A <procedure-name> shall have an explicit interface and shall
     refer to an accessible procedure pointer, external procedure,
     dummy-procedure, or module procedure."

Edits in paper 05-202r1 allowed internal procedures to be passed as
actual arguments and to be targets of procedure pointers. This meant
an internal procedure could be the target of a procedure pointer
which was specified in a generic interface body.

Paper 08-178 asked the question "What is the point of excluding 
internal procedure in C1207?" and replaced C1207 with 

   "A <procedure-name> shall be a nonintrinsic procedure that has an
    explicit interface."

The normative text cited in the question was not modified.
This was an oversight.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[294:11-12] 15.4.3.4.1 Generic identifiers, p1, second sentence,
            Change "procedure pointers, external procedures, dummy
                    procedures, or module procedures"
            to "nonintrinsic procedures with explicit interfaces".

This makes the sentence read:
  "The PROCEDURE statement lists nonintrinsic procedures with explicit
   interfaces that have this generic interface."

NUMBER: F18/003
TITLE: Pointer association of component of non-definable selector
KEYWORDS: Pointer association, Associate name
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider the following

  type :: T
    real, pointer :: X
  end type T

  type(t), external :: F
  real, target :: P

  associate ( A => F(42) )
    nullify ( A%X )             !***
    A%X => P                    !***
  end associate

The topic is whether the statements marked "!***" (the NULLIFY
statement and the pointer assignment statement) conform to the
standard.

11.1.3.3p5 ([175:18-21] of 18-007r1) has two requirements that are
relevant to this topic:
    "The associating entity itself is a variable, but if the selector
     is not a definable variable, the associating entity is not
     definable and shall not be defined or become undefined. If a
     selector is not permitted to appear in a variable definition
     context (19.6.7), neither the associate name nor any subobject
     thereof shall appear in a variable definition context."

With regards to the second sentence, neither NULLIFY nor a pointer
assignment statement is a variable definition context (19.6.7,
[516:12-30] lists fifteen variable definition context: neither
statement appears in the list.  Therefore it seems that this
requirement is satisfied.

With regards to the first sentence, the associate-name A "shall not
be defined or become undefined".  It appears that neither of these
statements cause A to be defined or become undefined, because
(a) An object of derived type is defined if and only all of its
    nonpointer components are defined (see 19.6.1p4, [511:11]).
    The pointer association status of the component A%X is thus
    irrelevant to the question of whether A is defined.
(b) Neither statement appears anywhere in the giant lists of "Events
    that cause variables to become defined" (or "undefined") in
    19.6.5 and 19.6.6.

Therefore we must reluctantly conclude that the requirements of the
first sentence also appear to be satisfied.

Against this, it is certainly true that the *value* of A is affected
by the statements in question: see 7.5.8 Derived-type values, which
states that the "component value" of a pointer component is its
association status, and
    "The set of values of a particular derived type consists of all
     possible sequences of the component values..."

However, there is no rule in 11.1.3.3 about changing the values, even
though it might seem contradictory that something that changes the
value of an undefinable object would be permitted.

So the question is, are the two statements standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, these statements were not intended to be standard-conforming.
The lack of an explicit rule is an error in the standard.
An edit is provided to correct this error.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[175:21] 11.1.3.3 Other attributes of associate names, p5,
         After "variable definition context"
         insert " or a pointer association context",
making the whole paragraph read:
  "The associating entity itself is a variable, but if the selector
   is not a definable variable, the associating entity is not
   definable and shall not be defined or become undefined.  If a
   selector is not permitted to appear in a variable definition
   context (19.6.7), neither the associate name nor any subobject
   thereof shall appear in a variable definition context or pointer
   association context."
{Prohibit the marked statements.
 The extra context is only relevant to pointer subobjects, but this
 need not be stated explicitly.}

{This might appear to be an incompatibility since the explicit
 prohibition is missing from Fortran 2003 and 2008, and thus should
 require an edit to the "compatibility" subclauses in clause 4.
 However as it seems somewhat contradictory, it is argued that those
 standards do not establish an unambiguous interpretation of the code
 in question, so no compatibility issue arises.}

TITLE: Program execution sequence with failed images
KEYWORDS: Program execution, Termination of execution, Failed image, 
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider execution of a program with more than one image, and some
image has failed (perhaps by execution of FAIL IMAGE, or perhaps by
some actual failure).  Let us further suppose that all other images
have initiated normal termination.

According to 5.3.7 "Termination of execution", paragraph 1:
    "Termination of execution of the program occurs
     when all images have terminated execution."
This text is unchanged from Fortran 2008, which did not have failed
images.

As an image that has failed "has ceased participating in program
execution but has not terminated execution", it would seem that in
this situation, execution of the program has not terminated.

Should failed images cause execution of the program not to terminate?

ANSWER:

No, failed images have stopped participating in program execution and
therefore their existence should not prevent program termination.
That this definition is unchanged from Fortran 2008 is an oversight.

An edit is supplied to correct this.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[38:8] 5.3.7 Termination of execution, p1,
       After "when all images have"

TITLE: Does INPUT_UNIT really identify the same unit as *?
KEYWORDS: Connection, INPUT_UNIT
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

According to 16.10.2.13 INPUT_UNIT [429:8-9],
    "The value of the default integer scalar constant INPUT_UNIT
     identifies the same processor-dependent external unit
     preconnected for sequential formatted input as the one
     identified by an asterisk in a READ statement;"

Consider the program:

    PROGRAM input_unit_test
        USE iso_fortran_env
        CHARACTER(80) line
        OPEN(input_unit,FILE='test.dat',ACTION='read')
        READ(input_unit,'(a)') line
        PRINT *,TRIM(line)
        READ(*,'(a)') line
        PRINT *,TRIM(line)
    END PROGRAM

Furthermore, let us suppose the file test.dat contains the
following two lines:
dat line 1
dat line 2
and let us further suppose the file that was preconnected before the
OPEN statement contains the following single line:
inp line 1

Is the output of the program (1):
 dat line 1
 dat line 2
or is it (2):
 dat line 1
 inp line 1
?

The plain meaning of the words
    "identifies the same processor-dependent external unit...
     ...as the one identified by an asterisk in a READ"
would seem to imply that (1) is expected, not (2); however, only
some Fortran processors produce output (1), while others have been
observed to produce output (2).

ANSWER:

Output (1) is correct.  According to the quoted words, using
INPUT_UNIT in a READ statement must have the same effect as UNIT=*
(which is the same effect as not having a input/output control list).

It is common for unit 5 to be effectively preconnected to stdin, but
on some processors changing the connection of unit 5 (e.g. with an
OPEN statement) does not affect unit=*.  On such a processor, the
value of INPUT_UNIT should not be equal to 5, but to whatever value,
possibly negative, that will continue to connect to unit=*.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

None.

TITLE: Connection of INPUT_UNIT on different images
KEYWORDS: Connection, INPUT_UNIT
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

According to 16.10.2.13 INPUT_UNIT [429:8-9],
    "The value of the default integer scalar constant INPUT_UNIT
     identifies the same processor-dependent external unit
     preconnected for sequential formatted input as the one
     identified by an asterisk in a READ statement;"
and according to 12.5.1 Referring to a file [217:10-11],
    "In a READ statement, an io-unit that is an asterisk identifies
     an external unit that is preconnected for sequential formatted
     input on image 1 in the initial team only (12.6.4.3)."

This leaves unanswered the status of the i/o unit identified by
INPUT_UNIT on images other that 1.  Plausible interpretations are:
(a) it is not preconnected on other images;
(b) it is preconnected, but to a processor-dependent file;
(c) it is preconnected, but it is not standard-conforming for a
    program to use it;
(d) it is preconnected, but it raises an i/o error condition if a
    program attempts to use it;
(e) attempting to use INPUT_UNIT in any way, including connecting it
    to another file, is not conforming;
(f) INPUT_UNIT may be connected to another file, but it is still
    processor-dependent whether it may be used;
(g) on an image other than image 1,
    - it is processor-dependent whether it is preconnected,
    - if it is preconnected,
        * it is processor-dependent to what file,
        * it is processor-dependent whether use is permitted,
    - if it is subsequently connected, it is processor-dependent
      whether it may be used.

Q1. What is the preconnection status of INPUT_UNIT on images other
    than image one?

Q2. On an image other than image one, if INPUT_UNIT happens to be
    preconnected, may it be used?

Q3. On an image other than image one, if INPUT_UNIT is connected to
    a different file by an OPEN statement, may it be used?

Also, the definition text for INPUT_UNIT in 16.10.2.13 makes no
mention of any caveat, but implies it is preconnected on every image.
Perhaps this text could be clarified.

ANSWER:

A1. INPUT_UNIT (and thus the unit identified by an asterisk in a READ
    statement) was not intended to be preconnected on images other
    than image one in the initial team.

    An edit is supplied to correct this omission.

TITLE: Problems with C_FUNLOC and C_F_PROCPOINTER being PURE
KEYWORDS: C_FUNLOC, C_F_PROCPOINTER, ISO_C_BINDING
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting 

QUESTIONS:

1) Regarding C_FUNLOC (X), 

In 15.7 Pure procedures, constraint C1590 is:

  "C1590 The specification-part of a pure subprogram shall specify
         that all its dummy procedures are pure."

In 15.5.2.9 Actual arguments associated with dummy procedure entities,
the first paragraph says

  "If the interface of a dummy procedure is explicit, its
   characteristics as a procedure (15.3.1) shall be the same as those
   of its effective argument, except that a pure effective argument
   may be associated with a dummy argument that is not pure and an
   elemental intrinsic actual procedure may be associated with a dummy
   procedure (which cannot be elemental)."

If C_FUNLOC is PURE, then these together imply that the actual
argument, X, has to be a PURE procedure. This is not stated in the
specification of this function in 18.2.3.5.  This has the effect of
limiting the uses of C_FUNLOC compared to the specification in Fortran
2008. This is not indicated in 4.3.3 Fortran 2008 compatibility.  Was
this an intentional change, or was making C_FUNLOC PURE a mistake?

2) Regarding C_F_PROCPOINTER (CPTR, FPTR), a similar argument to that
above implies that the INTENT(OUT) procedure pointer, FPTR, is a PURE
procedure. However, there is no stated requirement that the input
argument CPTR be PURE, and indeed there is no specification of what
that even means if CPTR is a pointer to an interoperable C function.
This suggests that C_F_PROCPOINTER provides a backdoor allowing an
impure procedure to appear to be pure, invalidating the assumptions
that are associated with a pure procedure.  Was making C_F_PROCPOINTER
a PURE a mistake?

ANSWER:

1) Making C_F_PROCPOINTER PURE was a mistake.  Edits are included to
   correct this error.  

2) It was not an error to make C_FUNLOC PURE.  Constraint C1590 does
   not apply to C_FUNLOC as it is an intrinsic module procedure, and
   as such is not defined by a subprogram. If a PURE procedure invokes
   C_FUNLOC, then the argument to C_FUNLOC must be a PURE procedure.
   However if an IMPURE procedure invokes C_FUNLOC, the actual
   argument to C_FUNLOC need not be a PURE procedure. An edit is
   provided to clarify this.

EDITS to 18-007r1:

[469:26-27] In 18.2.3 Procedures in the module, 18.2.3.1 General,
second sentence, change "C_F_POINTER subroutine is" to "C_F_POINTER
and C_F_PROCPOINTER subroutines are".

Making the whole sentence read

  "The C_F_POINTER and C_F_PROCPOINTER subroutines are impure; all
   other procedures in the module are pure."

[472:30] In 18.2.3.5 C_FUNLOC (X) after "object." add
  "If C_FUNLOC is called from a PURE procedure, X shall be a PURE
   procedure, otherwise it may be IMPURE."

TITLE: Categories of pure procedures
KEYWORDS: pure
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Subclause 15.7 Pure procedures begins with a list of categories of
pure procedures.  The list does not include procedure pointers or
type-bound procedures.  Dummy procedures are included in the list, and
so dummy procedure pointers are allowed, but other procedure pointers
are not.

Q1. Can procedure pointers that are not dummy procedures be pure?

Q2: Can type-bound procedures be pure?

ANSWER:

A1.  Procedure pointers that are not dummy procedures are allowed to
     be pure.  The absence of procedure pointers in the list in
     Subclause 15.7 is an oversight.  An edit to correct the oversight
     is provided.

A2.  Type-bound procedures that are bound to pure procedures are pure.
     The absence of type-bound procedures in Subclause 15.7 is an
     oversight.  An edit to correct the oversight is provided.

EDITS to 18-007r1:

TITLE: Categories of elemental procedures
KEYWORDS: elemental
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

The list of categories of elemental procedures at the start of
Subclause 15.8 "Elemental procedures" [325:11-12] is incomplete.
Procedures that are defined to be elemental in intrinsic modules
are not included.  Type-bound procedures are not included.
Dummy procedures and procedure pointers are not included, but
there is evidence that those omissions were intentional.

The standard intrinsic modules specify several procedures to be
elemental.  The omission of module procedures declared in intrinsic
modules from the list in Subclause 15.8 creates a contradiction.

Subclause 7.5.6.2 [80:5-8] and Subclause 7.5.7.3 [82:16] both
assume that type-bound procedures may be elemental.

Nonintrinsic elemental procedures cannot be used as actual arguments
[301: 29,  15.5.1 "Syntax of a procedure reference" p1].  Elemental
procedures specified in the standard intrinsic modules are generic,
and so they cannot be passed as actual arguments.  Elemental intrinsic
procedures can be passed as actual arguments [309: 2-5, 15.5.2.9
"Actual arguments associated with dummy procedure entities" p1], but
the text cited indicates that dummy procedures cannot be elemental.

Procedure pointers pose a bit of a problem.  A nonintrinsic elemental
procedure cannot be the target of a pointer assignment [165:34,
10.2.2.2 "Syntax of the pointer assignment statement" ].  However,
Subclause 10.2.2.4 "Pointer procedure assignment" paragraph 3 states

      If the pointer object has an explicit interface, its
      characteristics shall be the same as the pointer target except
      that the pointer target may be pure even if the pointer object
      is not pure and the pointer target may be an elemental intrinsic
      procedure even if the pointer object is not elemental.

The final phrase suggests that a pointer object might be elemental,
but it does not say that it can be elemental.

Q1. Is a procedure in an intrinsic module that is specified
    to be elemental an elemental procedure?

Q2. Can a type-bound procedure be elemental?

Q3. Can a dummy procedure be specified to be elemental?

Q4. Can a procedure pointer be specified to be elemental?

ANSWER:

A1. Procedures in intrinsic modules that are specified to be elemental
    are elemental.  An edit is provided to correct the omission in
    Subclause 15.8.

A2. A type-bound procedure that is bound to an elemental
    procedure is elemental.  An edit is provided to correct
    the omission in Subclause 15.8.

A3. A dummy procedure cannot be specified to be elemental.
    An edit is provided to make this restriction explicit.

A4. A procedure pointer cannot be specified to be elemental.
    An edit is provided to make this restriction explicit.

The edits provided are intended to make the impact on the existing
standard small.  More extensive changes are probably desirable, and
could be made in a revision of the standard.  In particular, the
restrictions on dummy arguments and procedure pointers could be made
constraints.

        "elemental intrinsic procedure even if the pointer object

TITLE:  Internal procedure in a generic interface
KEYWORDS: Internal procedure, Generic interface
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

In Fortran 2003, an internal subprogram was not allowed to define a
specific procedure for a generic identifier:

Fortran 2003 [285:14-15]
C1207 (R1206) A <procedure-name> shall have an explicit interface and
      shall refer to an accessible procedure pointer, external
      procedure, dummy procedure, or module procedure.

Paper 08-178 proposed the new feature of permitting an internal
procedure in this context, and this was included in Fortran 2008:

[Fortran 2008 281:8]
C1207 (R1206) A <procedure-name> shall be a nonintrinsic procedure
      that has an explicit interface.

However, this new feature was not mentioned in the Introduction of
Fortran 2008, nor is it mentioned in Annex C.1 of Fortran 2018
(which lists Fortran 2008 features not originally mentioned in its
Introduction).

Should this be mentioned in Annex C.1?

ANSWER:

Yes, this new feature should be mentioned in Annex C.1.

TITLE:  TEAM_NUMBER arguments and intrinsic function are ambiguous
KEYWORDS: NUM_IMAGES, IMAGE_INDEX, TEAM_NUMBER, teams
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider

PROGRAM p
   n = NUM_IMAGES()
   n1 = MERGE(1,2,THIS_IMAGE()<2)
   n2 = MERGE(1,3,THIS_IMAGE()<3)
   FORM TEAM(n1,x)
   FORM TEAM(n2,y)
   IF (n1==1) THEN
     CHANGE TEAM (x)
       PRINT *,NUM_IMAGES(TEAM_NUMBER=1) !(A)
       PRINT *,NUM_IMAGES(TEAM_NUMBER=3) !(B)
     END TEAM
   END IF
END PROGRAM

According to 16.9.145 NUM_IMAGES, the TEAM_NUMBER argument
    "shall identify the initial team or a team whose parent is the
     same as that of the current team".

However, at (A), there are two teams with team number 1 and the same
parent, one created by the FORM TEAM with "n1", the other created by
the FORM TEAM with "n2".

At (B), there is only one team with team number 3 and the same parent
as the current team, however, it is not a "sibling" team in that it
was not created by the same FORM TEAM statement.

Referring to the definition of the term "team number" at 3.145.4:
    "-1 which identifies the initial team, or positive integer that
     identifies a team within its parent team"
which has the same flaw in that there could be multiple teams within
the parent team that have that number.

Q1. Was TEAM_NUMBER in NUM_IMAGES, and the "team number" definition,
    intended to limit the identification to teams created by
    corresponding FORM TEAM statement executions?

Q2. The TEAM_NUMBER argument of IMAGE_INDEX suffers from similar
    wording. Was this also intended to be limited to "sibling" teams?

ANSWER:

Yes, this is the intention.  Edits are provided.

The edits use the terminology "corresponding" executions, as execution
on more than one image can hardly be the "same" execution.

The edits also use the term "sibling teams". As sibling teams are
always created as a group, and really only have meaning when there are
more than one, the plural form is probably most appropriate.

EDITS:

[20:27+] Terms and definitions:
  Insert after the definition of "parent team"
  "3.145.3+
   sibling teams
   teams created by a single set of corresponding executions of the
   FORM TEAM statement (11.6.9)"

[20:30] 3.145.4 team number, definition, change
        "within its parent team" -> "among its sibling teams"
making the definition read
    "-1 which identifies the initial team, or a positive integer that 
   identifies a team among its sibling teams (5.3.4)

[same place] Append a (normative) note
    "Note 1 to entry: Teams are siblings when they were created by
                      corresponding FORM TEAM statement executions."
        and index "sibling teams" here.
{The Note should only be added if we don't make a separate team for
 sibling teams.}

[36:23] 5.3.4 Program execution, para 2, final sentence
        Replace "Within its parent team,"
        with    "Among its sibling teams,"
making the whole sentence read 
  "Among its sibling teams, each team is identified by its
   team_number; this is the integer value that was specified in the
   FORM TEAM statement."
{This is just waffle, no need to index "sibling teams".}

[131:18-19] In 9.6 Image selectors, p3 second sentence
            Replace "one of the teams that were formed by execution of
                     the FORM TEAM statement for"
            with    "a sibling team of"
making the whole sentence read
  "If a TEAM_NUMBER= specifier appears in an image-selector and the
   current team is not the initial team, the value of scalar-int-expr
   shall be equal to the value of a team number for a sibling team of
   the current team, and the team of the image selector is that team;
   the object shall be an established coarray in an ancestor team of
   the current team, or an associating entity of the CHANGE TEAM
   construct."

[204:35] 11.6.9 FORM TEAM statement, p1,
         change "creates new teams"
         to     "creates a set of sibling teams"
         and index "sibling teams" here.
This makes that whole paragraph read:
    "The FORM TEAM statement creates a set of sibling teams whose
     parent team is the current team."

[380:12-13] In 16.9.97 IMAGE_INDEX, p3 TEAM_NUMBER
    Change
        "team whose parent is the same as that of the current team"
    to
        "sibling team of the current team"
    and index "sibling teams" here.
making  the whole argument read:
 "TEAM_NUMBER shall be an integer scalar. It shall identify the
  initial team or a sibling team of the current team."

    Change
        "team whose parent is the same as that of the current team"

TITLE: Type of OPERATION arguments to the REDUCE intrinsic
KEYWORDS: REDUCE, OPERATION, polymorphic, type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting 

QUESTION:

Section 16.9.161 REDUCE p3 describes the arguments to the intrinsic
subroutine CO_REDUCE. 

The description of the ARRAY argument states:
 "ARRAY shall be an array of any type." 

It describes the OPERATION argument as:

 "OPERATION shall be a pure function with exactly two arguments; each
  argument shall be a scalar, nonallocatable, nonpointer, nonoptional
  dummy data object with the same type and type parameters as ARRAY.
  If one argument has the ASYNCHRONUS, TARGET, or VALUE attribute, the
  other shall have that attribute.  Its result shall be a non-
  polymorphic scalar and have the same type and type parameters as
  ARRAY.  OPERATION should implement a mathematically associative
  operation.  It need not be commutative." 

The function result of OPERATION cannot be polymorphic.  The arguments
to OPERATION must have the same type as its result, and thus cannot be
polymorphic.  However, ARRAY can be polymorphic.  This means the dynamic
type of ARRAY must be the same type as the arguments and result of
OPERATION.  This seems like an unfortunate requirement.

Was it intended that the dynamic type of ARRAY be required to match
the type and type parameters of the arguments of OPERATION?

ANSWER:

No, this requirement was not intended.  Edits are provided to correct
the problem.

EDITS:
[408:36] change "type and type parameters"
         to     "declared type and type parameters"

[408:39] change "type and type parameters"
         to     "declared type and type parameters"

so that the description of OPERATION reads:
  "shall be a pure function with exactly two arguments; each argument
   shall be a scalar, nonallocatable, nonpointer, nonoptional dummy
   data object with the same declared type and type parameters as
   ARRAY.  If one argument has the ASYNCHRONOUS, TARGET, or VALUE
   attribute, the other shall have the attribute. Its result shall be
   a non-polymorphic scalar and have the same declared type and type
   parameters as ARRAY.  OPERATION should implement a mathematically 
   associative operation. It need not be commutative."
  
[409:5] change "type and type parameters"
        to     "declared type and type parameters"

so that the first sentence of Result Characteristics reads:
  "The result is of the same declared type and type parameters as
   ARRAY."

TITLE: Example in C.6.8 is wrong
KEYWORDS: failed images
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Q1.

   A: In the example in C.6.8, the assignments
        me[k] = failures(i)
        id[k] = 1
      are made by image 1 and the assignments
        me = THIS_IMAGE ()
        id = MERGE (1, 2, me<=images_used)
      are made by image k in unordered segments. Was this intended?

   B: In the example in C.6.8, the assignment
           me[k] = failures(i)
      is made by image 1 and me[k] is referenced on other images in
      the FORM TEAM statement in unordered segments. Was this
      intended?

Q2.

    Suppose the program in C.6.8 is executed by 11 images, so 1 is
    intended to be a spare. If image 9 in the initial team fails
    immediately before it executes the first FORM TEAM statement, then
    image 10 in the initial team, which executes FORM TEAM with a
    team-number == 1 and NEW_INDEX == 10 (== me), will have specified
    a NEW_INDEX= value greater than the number of images in the new
    team.  Should there be a test for this in the code?

Q3.

   A: If a replacement image has failed, its image index will be the
      value of an element of the array failures, a replacement for it
      will be found, and the replacement will be placed in team 1. Was
      this intended?

   B: The value of images_used increases each time the setup loop is
      executed.  However, the array failures will contain the image
      indices of all the failed images and allocate all of them fresh
      replacements. Was this intended?

ANSWER:

1-A: No. An image control statement that provides segment ordering is
     needed. An edit is provided to correct this.

1-B: No. An edit is provided to correct this.

2: This is quite a low-probability event, so exiting with the error
   condition seems appropriate.  An edit is provided.

3-A: No. An edit is provided to correct this.
 
3_B: No. It was intended to allocate replacements only for the newly
