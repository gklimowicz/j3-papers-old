Subject: DE66 - CFI_address issue

Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~

For the function CFI_address from ISO_Fortran_binding.h (18.5.5.2),
[500:22-23] supplies restrictions on the subscript values. As worded
now, this excludes the ability to obtain a valid address if the C
descriptor is for an assumed-size array, because in that case the
extent member in the last array dimension has the value -1.

An edit is supplied to relax the restriction for this special case.

Edit to N2137:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[500:23] In 18.5.5.2 The CFI_address function, para 2, subscripts,
after "of the C descriptor", add

"except for the last dimension of a C descriptor for an assumed-size
array.  For the C descriptor of an assumed-size array, the value of
the subscript for the last dimension shall not be less than the lower
bound, and the array element number specified by the subscripts shall
not exceed the size of the array."
