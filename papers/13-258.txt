Subject: Oversights in TS 18508

1. The problems
---------------

There are no constraints in the TS 18508 draft against a CYCLE or EXIT
statement belonging to a construct outer to a CHANGE TEAM construct.

This isn't technically a problem since the synchronization could be done
no matter how execution of the construct is completed.  It is better on
stylistic grounds, however, to constrain against against it, under the
hypothesis that it is easier to understand the program, and believe it
is correct

A reference to a collective subroutine is not announced in 8.5.1 to be
an image control statement (compare to edits for F08/0040 concerning
MOVE_ALLOC).  Rather, a requirement on collective subroutines that
invocation of them shall only appear in contexts that allow an image
control statement appears in 7.2 at the end of the first paragraph.

2. Edits to 13-251/N1967 (TS 18508 draft)
-----------------------------------------

[13-251/N1967:15:14 7.2p1] Replace "calls to" by "invocations of".

[13-251/N1967:15:15-16 7.2p1] Delete "A call ... image control
statement."

[13-251/N1967:27:3+] Insert edit to C821 in 8.1.6.6.3 CYCLE statement

"{Replace C821 in 8.1.6.6.3 CYCLE statement}

"C821 (R831) A <cycle-stmt> within a CHANGE TEAM, CRITICAL, or DO
      CONCURRENT construct shall not belong to an outer construct."

[13-251/N1967:27:3+] Insert edit to replace C845 in 8.1.10 EXIT
statement (see also 201-wvs-002).

"{Replace C845 in 8.1.10 EXIT statement}

"C845 An <exit-stmt> within a DO CONCURRENT construct shall not belong
      to that construct or an outer construct; an <exit-stmt> within a
      CHANGE TEAM or CRITICAL construct shall not belong to an outer
      construct."

[13-251/N1967:27:9+ or thereabouts] Insert a bullet (compare to edits
for F08/0040 concerning MOVE_ALLOC)

"o  a CALL statement that invokes a collective intrinsic subroutine;"

This could be combined with the edit from F08/0040

"o  a CALL statement that invokes the intrinsic subroutine MOVE_ALLOC
    with coarray arguments, or a collective intrinsic subroutine;"

Concerning branching and RETURN statements, see 201-wvs-001.
