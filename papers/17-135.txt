Subject: EDIT: Consistent wording of STAT= in 16.6
Date: 2017 February 16

1. Discussion
-------------

[345] para 4,5,6 and 7 - there is inconsistency in how these 4
paragraphs start.

Para 4 says "optional STAT", other para just "STAT". Since the "STAT"
is followed by "argument is present", it is clearly optional.

Para 4 says "reference to a collective", para 5 and 6 say "invocation
of a collective", para 7 omits this completely.

It is suggested to make the wording in all 4 para consistent.


2. Edits to 17-007
------------------

In 16.6 Collective subroutines

[345:25] In paragraph 4, remove "optional" and replace "a reference
         to" with "an invocation of",

making the sentence start with

"If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of a collective
subroutine".

[345:31] In paragraph 7, first sentence, after "present", insert "in
         an invocation of a collective subroutine",

making the sentence start with

"If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of a collective
subroutine and the current team".

{cosmetic change to have consistent wording}
