	        Partial Response to N1524 (override, binding)

  paper 03-113r3

[42:9+] 

Subgroup does not feel it is necessary to add more words about overriding.
For example, character lengths can be overridden but we have no specification
words about it.

[53:30] is fixed by N1552.

Subgroup does not agree that the keywords are incorrect.

Subgroup does agree that the cross-referencing is wrong, 

Move the first reference from [56:5] to [56:3].

Insert "A" before the first "binding" at [56:5].

The bad use of the term "binding" is fixed in N1560.

[59:8+10] Delete duplicate blank line.
[59::8+11] Replace with
	"For  a more elaborate example see C1.4."

[105:6-7] Subgroup is also confused and suspects
this is either spurious or wrong.  Defer to J3.
 
Subgroup notes that  (R612) bits are fixed by N1560.
 The xrefs for 4.5.7 are fixed by N1552.

Subgroup thinks dtv-type-spec may indeed use an abstract type
with the CLASS keyword.
 
paper 03-138r1
[55:15-17] In
	"Within the <specification-part> of a module, each <generic-binding>
	shall specify, either explicitly or implicitly, the same accessibility as
	every other generic binding in the same derived type  that has the
	same <generic-spec>."
change "in ...<generic-spec>" -> "with that <generic-spec> in the same derived 
type".

	
 >[53:21-22] I'm not sure I understand the reason given for this

Subgroup:  There are 8 conditions relevant to overriding
and there is no reason to single one out.

 >   [53:30+] I think the "may be" should be "is".  See comments on
    03-177
Subgroup rejects this because of [56:16-17].
 

  paper 03-164r1

Move ref to (5.1.1.8) from [409:29] to [409:18].

[493:28-29] Delete.

[493:35-36] Delete ", in" and ", TKR incompatibility"

[494:1-2] Delete ",in" and ", TKR incompatibility"

[494:32] "TKR" -> "type, kind type parameters, or rank, "

[496:29] Delete "TKR".

[496:32] "TKR incompatible ( ... )" -> "distinguishable"

[496:34] Before "procedures" insert "references to"
               Change "distinguishable" to "unambiguous"
{Use same word in first half of sentence as in second half,
and avoid potential confusion with applying "distinguishable"
to a procedure set instead of a dummy argument pair.}

We see nothing wrong with the definition or use of 
"TKR compatible".
