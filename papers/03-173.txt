Subject:  Action on Japan's comments

The following edits from Japan's comments are accepted as is:

[13:32]  Add the case of a scoping unit of an interface body to "all
         program units and subprograms" to justify the "IMPORT state-
         ments" in Table 2.1.
[24:7+]  In Table 3.1, change "Vertical bar" to "Vertical line", i.e.
         the name of "|" in ISO/IEC 646 and ISO/IEC 10646.
[71:6+]  In NOTE 5.5, line 12, change "matrix" to "humongous_matrix".
[91:16+] In NOTE 5.36, line 6, change "need" to "need to".
[109:4]  Move the rule R632 after R626.
[121:7+] In Table 7.1, change "C  I,R  L,L" to "C  C  L" for rel-ops.
[253:12] Exchange this paragraph and the next.
[255:9-24] Move all the R rules immediately after R1205.  C1202 has
         a forward reference and is hard to read.
[258:5]  Adjust the space between "7.1.3" and "7.1.8.7".
[265:9-10] The restriction that an actual argument corresponding to a
         polymorphic dummy argument must be polymorphic is, in our
         opinion, surprising, even in the case of dummy argument that
         is allocatable or pointer.  Add a note explaining the intent.
[292:9]  Change "total number" to "Total number".
[333:(positional)7]  Add ")" after "FROM (12.7.3".
[353:6-10] Exchange and renumber Subsections 13.8.1 and 13.8.2.
[362:26] Change "[P,][R]" to "[P,R]".
[378:] In NOTE 14.14, Change "--" to "-".
[379:] In NOTE 14.15, Change "--" to "-" thrice.

The following edits are modified, for the reasons stated

[2:24]   before "kind" insert "an intrinsic type with a".
         "values" -> "value".
         move the "(4.4)" to after "processor".

         {The condition is only relevant for kind type parameters
          of intrinsic types.  We clarify that, which was probably
          a good thing to do anyway.  Then it becomes more obvious
          that 4.4 is an appropriate xref.}

[173:27] No edit (unless JOR suggests otherwise).

         {Japan suggested deleting "or a file positioning statement",
          noting that "This clause has been here for long, but we found
          it unnecessary and confusing."  I am uncertain of the
          technical effect of this edit and thus am reluctant to do
          it as editor.  I'll leave the technical question to JOR.}

[261:13+] At beginning of Note 12.14 insert
          "The following code illustrates PROCEDURE statements.
           Note 7.42 illustrates the use of the P and BESSEL
           defined by this code."
