Discussion

The editor points out that a statement on co-rank and co-bounds is
needed in 2.5.9. An edit is supplied.

Edits to 07-007r2:

[33:16] In 2.5.9 Allocatable variables, para 3, add

    "If an allocatable variable is a co-array, the co-rank is
     declared, but the co-bounds are determined when it is allocated."
