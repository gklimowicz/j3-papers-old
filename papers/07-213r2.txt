NUMBER:   F03/0089
TITLE:    Interoperability of non-BIND derived types
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, derived type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS:   Passed by J3 meeting

INTRODUCTION

Subclause 15.2.3 of 04-007 says [398:9-12]:

  "A Fortran derived type is interoperable with a C struct type if the
   derived-type definition of the Fortran type specifies BIND(C) (4.5.1),
   the Fortran derived type and the C struct type have the same number of
   components, and the components of the Fortran derived type have types
   and type parameters that are interoperable with the types of the
   corresponding components of the struct type."

QUESTIONS

  1. Is a Fortran derived type for which BIND(C) is not specified
     interoperable with any C struct type?

  2. Does a Fortran derived type interoperate with a C struct type that
     has a different number of components?

  3. Does a Fortran derived type interoperate with a C struct type that
     specifies the same components in a different order?

  4. Does a Fortran derived type with a pointer or allocatable component
     that has interoperable type and type parameters interoperate with
     any C struct type?

ANSWERS:

None of these Fortran derived types are interoperable with any C struct type.

EDITS:

  [398:9] Replace "if" by "if and only if".
