Subject: Coindexing wording glitch
Date: 2017 June 25


1. Introduction

This paper suggests en editorial change to the rules for coindexed
object usage.


2. Discussion

Dummy variables that are allocatable/pointer have their rules split
into three subclauses:
(1) common rules for allocatable and pointer,
(2) rules for allocatable,
(3) rules for pointer.

In the common rules we have
    "If the actual argument is a coindexed object, the dummy argument
     shall have the INTENT (IN) attribute."
However, in the pointer rules we have
    "The actual argument corresponding to a dummy pointer shall not be
     a coindexed object."
Making the allegedly "common" rule into an "allocatable-only" rule.
This rule should be moved into the correct subclause.


3. Edits to N2123 (17-007r1)

[320:6] 15.5.2.5 Allocatable and pointer dummy variables, p6,
        Delete (move) entire paragraph
            "If the actual argument is a coindexed object, ...".
{This paragraph does not apply to both allocatable and pointer.}

[320:11+] 15.5.2.6 Allocatable dummy variables, p3+,
          After paragraph "The corank of the actual..."
          Insert/move new paragraph we deleted earlier:
    "If the actual argument is a coindexed object, the dummy argument
     shall have the INTENT (IN) attribute."
{This is a good place for that paragraph.}
