Please will you consider the following edit.

75:14+  Add new paragraph:

    Allocation of a pointer creates an object that implicitly has the
    TARGET attribute.

This is copied from 6.3.1.3, so the present draft is not in error, but
email correspondence with Yuji Tsujimori of Fujitsu has convinced me
that this edit is desirable. We think that a section on the TARGET
atribute should mention this very important class of objects that have
the TARGET attribute.
