Subject: examples for use of the CFI_associate() function
Date: 2011 February 16
References: N1838

INTRODUCTION:

The function CFI_associate() is designed for two usage patterns:

(1) to modify C descriptors for assumed shape entities so as to allow
    production of array slices / subobjects or create assumed-shape
    entities inside C,
(2) to perform something much (but not fully?) like pointer association
    for C descriptors for Fortran POINTERs.

This paper provides some examples for the use of this function
(hopefully making the correct assumptions about its semantics).

Given the Fortran interface for a function which is intended to
set every second array element, beginning with the first one, to
some provided value,

interface
  subroutine set_odd(int_array, val) bind(c)
    use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding, only : c_int
    integer(c_int) :: int_array(:)
    integer(c_int), value :: val
  end subroutine
end interface

the implementation in C reads

#include "ISO_Fortran_binding.h"

void set_odd(CFI_cdesc_t *int_array, int val) {
   CFI_dim_t dims[1];
   CFI_CDESC_T(1) array;
   int status;
   /* the following is equivalent to saying int_array(1::2) in Fortran */
   dims[0]->lower_bound = 0;
   dims[0]->extent      = (int_array->dim[0].extent + 1)/2;
   dims[0]->sm          = 2*int_array->dim[0].sm;
   /* Update the descriptor with the new information */
   status = CFI_establish_cdesc(&array,
                                int_array->base_addr,
                                CFI_attribute_assumed,
                                int_array->type,
                                int_array->elem_len,
                                /* rank */ 1,
                                dims);

   set_all(array, val);

   /* here one could make use of int_array and access all its data */

}

A copy of the incoming descriptor is created because the call
to CFI_establish_cdesc() irreversibly modifies the descriptor
{\footnote At least the extent and sm members of
int_array->dim[0] will be modified: sm will be doubled, and the
value of the extent member will be changed to
(extent + 1)/2. }.

<<COMMENT to J3: Don't you want to discourage manual modification
  of these members apart from copying them in from another descriptor
  once they're set up?>>

Without such a copy, it would not be possible to access all
data of the incoming descriptor after the invocation of CFI_establish_cdesc(),
which may be a problem for the remaining part of the implementation, or
- after the call site - for a C function which invokes set_odd()
(see below).

The function set_odd() implements its functionality in terms
of a Fortran subprogram

subroutine set_all(int_array, val) bind(c)
  integer(c_int) :: int_array(:)
  integer(c_int), value :: val
  int_array = val
end subroutine

Let invocation of set_odd() from a Fortran program be done as follows:

integer(c_int) :: d(5)
d = (/ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 /)
call set_odd(d, -1)
write(*, *) d

Then, the program will print
   -1    2   -1    4   -1

During execution of the subprogram set_all(), its dummy object
int_array would appear to be an array of size 3 with lower bound
1 and upper bound 3.

It is also possible to invoke set_odd() from C. However, it is
the C programmer's responsibility to make sure that all members
of the descriptor have the correct value on entry to the function.
Inserting additional checking into the function's implementation
could alleviate this problem.

/* necessary includes omitted */
#define ARRAY_SIZE 5

CFI_CDESC_T(1) d;
CFI_dim_t dims[1];
void *base;
int i, status;

base = malloc(ARRAY_SIZE*sizeof(int));
dims[0]->lower_bound = 0;
dims[0]->extent      = ARRAY_SIZE;
dims[0]->sm          = sizeof(int);
/* different from CFI_allocate, stride must be specified here */
status = CFI_establish_cdesc(&d,
                             base,
                             CFI_attribute_assumed,
                             CFI_type_int,
                             sizeof(int),
                             /* rank * / 1,
                             dims);

set_odd(d, -1);

for (i=0; i<ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
  subscripts[1] = i;
  printf("   %d",*((int *)CFI_address(d, subscripts)));
}
printf("\n");
free(base);

This C program will print (apart from formatting) the same
output as the Fortran program above. It also demonstrates how an
assumed shape entity is dynamically generated within C.


A.2.3 Example for handling objects with the POINTER attribute

The following C function modifies a pointer to an integer variable
to point at a global variable defined inside C:


#include "ISO_Fortran_binding.h"

int y = 2;

void change_target(CFI_cdesc_t *ip) {
  if (ip->attribute == CFI_attribute_pointer && ip->rank == 0) {
    CFI_establish_cdesc(ip,
                        &y,
                        CFI_attribute_pointer,
                        CFI_type_int,
                        sizeof(int),
                        /* rank */ 0,
                        /* dim  */ NULL);
  }
}

The following Fortran code

use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding

interface
  subroutine change_target(ip) bind(c)
    import :: c_int
    integer(c_int), pointer :: ip
  end subroutine
end interface

integer(c_int), target :: it = 1
integer(c_int), pointer :: it_ptr

it_ptr => it
write(*,*) it_ptr
call change_target(it_ptr)
write(*,*) it_ptr

will then print
1
2"


<<COMMENT to J3: It should be made clear whether the Fortran pointer
  is (A) updated when CFI_establish_cdesc() is invoked (or the descriptor is
  manually modified inside C), or (B) when the C routine returns.

  An (admittedly exotic, because OpenMP based) example which shows
  up the difference: replace the invocation of change_target
  above by

!$omp parallel
: ! set mythread appropriately
if (mythread == 0) then
  call change_target(it_ptr)
else if (mythread == 1) then
!$omp barrier
  write(*,*) it_ptr
end if
!$omp end parallel

  and insert the line

#pragma omp barrier

  into the C function after the CFI_establish_cdesc() call. Under (A), all is
  fine, but with (B) there is a race condition. I suspect once J3
  proceeds to define interoperability of coarrays with UPC, there might
  be a manifest problem.>>
