Subject: Interp concerning coarrays and ultimate components

NUMBER: F08/0108
TITLE: ultimate components and coarrays
KEYWORD: ultimate components, coarrays
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTIONS:

1. Is the declaration of V permitted:

  type :: one
    real, allocatable :: C[:]
  end type one

  type :: two
    type(one), allocatable :: A
  end type two

  type(two), pointer :: V(:)

2. Is the declaration of X permitted:

  type :: three
    real :: C
  end type three

  type :: four
    type(three), allocatable :: A[:]
  end type four

  type(four) :: X

ANSWERS:

1. Type two is not conforming, because the entity A has a coarray
   ultimate component and C525 requires such an entity to be a
   nonpointer nonallocatable scalar.  Therefore the declaration of V
   is not permitted.

2. X satisfies C525, so declaration of X is permitted.  X has an
   ultimate (allocatable) coarray component (A[:]), and therefore
   acording to C526 must be a dummy argument or have the ALLOCATABLE
   or SAVE attribute.

EDITS:

None.
