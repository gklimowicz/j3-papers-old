In response to the discussion about the "or portion thereof" text on 02-007r2
[203:10-11], JOR offers the following clarifying edits:

203:9-11  Replace "the processor ... procedure." with
"the *dtv* dummy argument is argument associated with the effective list item
that caused the user-defined derived-type input procedure to be invoked, as if
the effective list item was an actual argument in this procedure reference
(2.5.6)."


201:26    Replace "(OUT)" with "(INOUT)"

201:41    Replace "(OUT)" with "(INOUT)"
