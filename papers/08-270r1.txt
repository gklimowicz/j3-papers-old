NUMBER: F03/0122
TITLE: When do objects of sequence derived type have the same type?
KEYWORDS: SEQUENCE type
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

       MODULE MOD
         TYPE, PRIVATE :: T
           SEQUENCE
           INTEGER :: I
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T) :: X, Y
       CONTAINS
         SUBROUTINE S
           X = Y
         END SUBROUTINE S
       END

       PROGRAM MAIN
         USE MOD
         CALL S
         X = Y
       END

The first sentence of subclause 4.5.1.3 of the 2003 Fortran standard says
the program conforms because the objects X and Y have the same type,
because they are declared by reference to the same type definition.  The
last sentence of that subclause says they do not have the same type
because the type definition is declared to be PRIVATE.

Does the program conform to the 2003 Fortran standard?

If not, which assignment statement causes the program not to conform?

ANSWER:

The program conforms to the 2003 Fortran standard.

ANALYSIS:

The determination that an object cannot have the same type as another one
that is declared by reference to a type that is declared to be PRIVATE
cannot possibly refer to an object declared in a scope where the type is
not accessible.  Therefore the objects must be declared in scopes where
the type is accessible.  It is irrelevant whether the type is "declared to
be PRIVATE" in that scope, because accessibility attributes determine
whether a name is accessible in a different scope.

It would be absurd if the assignment statement in the module subprogram
were not standard conforming.  Given that it must be standard conforming,
it would be absurd if the assignment statement in the main program were
not standard conforming.

Edits are provided to clarify this conclusion.

EDITS:

In subclause 4.5.1.3 [47:11], remove "declared to be PRIVATE or" from the
last sentence.
