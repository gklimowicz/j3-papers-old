Subject: Question re intrinsic FAILED_IMAGES
Date: 2019-August-06

QUESTION:
FAILED_IMAGES (16.9.77) provides the image indices of the images in the
specified team that are known to have failed. Paragraph 5 states that
"If the executing image has previously executed an image control
statement whose STAT= specifier assigned the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE
from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, or referenced a collective
subroutine whose STAT argument was set to STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, at least
one image in the set of images participating in that image control
statement or collective subroutine reference shall be known to have
failed."
This means that FAILED_IMAGES might provide a very incomplete list of
failed images. Was this intended?

ANSWER:
This is a "quality of implementation issue". It is hoped that most
implementations will provide a good list. If it is important that the
list be complete, the following loop could be used
    k = 0
    DO i = 1, NUM_IMAGES()
       IF(IMAGE_STATUS(i) == STAT_FAILED_IMAGE) THEN
          k = k + 1
          failed(k) = i
       END IF
    END DO
