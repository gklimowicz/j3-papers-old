Subject: remove duplication in Appendix C

~~~~~~~~~~~

The Appendix C subsections C.10 and C.11 both refer to clause 13.
Some duplication of material has arisen: both C.10.1 and C.11.2
contain examples for the use of atomic subroutines; the latter
subsection appears to contain the full set of the examples from
TS 18508 while the former one (already present in 16-007)
contains only two.

This paper suggests fusing and cleaning up C.10 and C.11. Also,
some minor issues in C.5.9 are fixed.

Edits:
~~~~~~

[552:5] Replace "A.2.1" by "C.10.2"; it is a bit infelicitous
that the two examples have moved so far apart.

[552:20] fix broken link for EVENT_TYPE

[586:19] Delete heading for "C.11 Clause 13 Notes"

[587:5]-[588:23] Delete duplicated text for atomic usage.

[588:24]-[589:18] Move examples 3 and 4 to [584:35+].
