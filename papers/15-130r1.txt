Discussion
----------

Anton Shterenlikht has commented (see N2045) that there are errors in
clause A.3.1. The edits for page 53 correct them.

He also thought that it was an error not to place a SYNC ALL statement
ahead of the subroutine call, but this is not necessary. During the
execution of a collective on one image, data cannot be accessed from
another image before the collective has been invoked on that image. An
edit to NOTE 7.4 clarifies this.

Edits to N2040:
---------------

[20:28+] In line 3 of NOTE 7.4, after "images." add "A transfer from
an image cannot occur before the collective subroutine has been
invoked on that image."

[53:17] Replace line by
"   j_max = j
    call co_max(j_max)"
