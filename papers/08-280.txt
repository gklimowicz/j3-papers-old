Date: 2008 October 13

The brief descriptions for BESSEL_JN and BESSEL_YN with three arguments
are wrong.  We could repair them either by changing the descriptions to
"Bessel functions of the first [second] kind and orders N1 through N2"
or by changing the brief descriptions of all Bessel functions to "Bessel
functions of the first [second] kind".

Straw vote: (1) Make all Bessel function descriptions simpler?
            (2) Make BESSEL_[JY]N descriptions correct but more wordy?
            (3) Huh?

Changes are required at [317: 13.5 Table 13.1] and [331-332: 13.7.20-25]
