Subject: Optional and mandatory blanks

1. Introduction

The separating blank(s) for the keywords END CRITICAL are optional,
but for END TEAM are mandatory.


2. Discussion

We allow the separating blanks between the END keyword and a following
keyword to be omitted in apparently every other case: it is a long list,
from ENDASSOCIATE all the way to ENDWHERE.

On the other hand, we have generally required the separating blank for
other cases, e.g. SYNC ALL which was added at the same time as
END CRITICAL.

Similarly, this time around, other keyword pairs we have added include
CHANGE TEAM, EVENT POST, EVENT WAIT, and SELECT RANK.  These all have
mandatory blank separation.

So the question is, do we want to maintain that the blank after END is
always optional?  Or just keep it simple.

Note: Regardless of the answer to this question, I think we should keep
      the mandatory blanks in CHANGE TEAM, EVENT POST, EVENT WAIT,
      SELECT RANK, SYNC ALL, SYNC IMAGES, and SYNC TEAM.  And any others
      I have neglected to mention.
