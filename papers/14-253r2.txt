Discussion
----------

Old proposal:
The changes proposed here are based on a suggestion in my ballot.
I think we need a clear definition of what is meant by a "known"
failed or stopped image. And if we add the concept of a stalled image,
as proposed in 14-250, I think we need a clear definition of what is
meant by a "known" stalled image.

New proposal:
We find defining "known" failed, stalled or stopped images are
misleading. However, adding a note to describe how a program
can detect failed, stalled or stopped images and retrieve that
information could be helpful.

Additionally, the existing description of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGES in the
base standard needs to account for setting a STAT argument in a call
to a collective subroutine.

Edits to N2027:
---------------

[14:7+] Add a Note 5.10

"In addition to detecting that an image has failed by having the
variable in a STAT=specifier or a STAT argument of a call to a
collective or atomic subroutine assigned the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE,
an image can get the indices of failed images in a specified team by
invoking the intrinsic function FAILED_IMAGES."

[14:7+] Add a Note 5.11 to the end of the new subclause 5.9:

"In addition to detecting that an image has stalled by having the
variable in a STAT=specifier or a STAT argument of a call to a
collective subroutine assigned the value STAT_STALLED_IMAGE, an image
can get the indices of stalled images in a specified team by invoking
the intrinsic function STALLED_IMAGES."

[40:15+] Add
"{In 13.8.2.24 STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, edit the paragraph as follows.}

The value of the default integer scalar constant STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE is
assigned to the variable specified in a STAT= specifier (6.7.4, 8.5.7)
\uwave{or a STAT argument in a call to a collective subroutine} if
execution of the statement with that specifier or argument requires
synchronization with an image that has initiated termination of
execution. This value shall be positive \sout{and different from the
value of IOSTAT INQUIRE INTERNAL UNIT}."

[40:15+] Add
"{In 13.8.2.24 STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, insert a new Note after
paragraph 1}

"In addition to detecting that an image has initiated normal
termination by having the variable in a STAT=specifier or a STAT
argument of a call to a collective subroutine assigned the value
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, an image can get the indices of the images that
have initiated normal termination in a specified team by invoking the
intrinsic function STOPPED_IMAGES."
