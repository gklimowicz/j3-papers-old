NUMBER: F18/031
TITLE: CO_BROADCAST with polymorphic argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the code fragment

    Subroutine asgn_for_image(a,b,srcimg)
      Class(*) a,b
      Integer,Intent(In) :: srcimg
      ! The assignment A = B is not allowed, so...
      If (This_Image()==srcimg) Then
        Call asgn(b)
      Else
        Call asgn(a)
      End If
    Contains
      Subroutine asgn(x)
        Class(*) x
        Call co_broadcast(x,Source_Image=srcimg)
      End Subroutine
    End Subroutine

There is no requirement forbidding the A argument of CO_BROADCAST
from being polymorphic, so on the face of it, this appears to get
around the prohibition against nonallocatable polymorphic
assignment.

However, CO_BROADCAST states
    "A becomes defined, as if by intrinsic assignment"
but intrinsic assignment is not defined when the variable is a
nonallocatable polymorphic. It can be convincingly argued that
the standard therefore does not establish an interpretation, and
thus the call to CO_BROADCAST is not valid.

Philosophically, it would seem to be strange to allow polymorphic
broadcast across images, but not to allow polymorphic assignment
of a single variable within an image let alone across images.

Is the call to CO_BROADCAST in the example standard-conforming?

(And if so, what are the actual semantics?)

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be conforming.
An edit is supplied with the missing requirement.

ALTERNATIVE ANSWER:

Yes, this was intended to be conforming.
An edit is supplied with the missing semantics.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[355:20] 16.9.46 CO_BROADCAST, p3 Arguments, argument A,
         After "It shall not be"
         Insert "polymorphic or"
         Making that sentence read
    "It shall not be polymorphic or a coindexed object."

ALTERNATIVE EDIT to 18-007r1:

[355:21] 16.9.46 CO_BROADCAST, p3 Arguments, argument A,
  Change "as if by intrinsic assignment"
  to "as if by an intrinsic assignment statement where the
      variable and expression are both nonpolymorphic with
      their declared type and type parameters equal to the
      dynamic type and type parameters of A".
