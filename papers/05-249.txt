Subject: Specifying CSV
Date 2005 August 5

At Delft (N1637), it was decided to add a "write CSV" files
feature.  However, a number of issues remain unspecified.

This paper attempts to delineate and prepare straw votes
regarding the specifications of the CSV feature.

This feature was first described in 05-108r1,
the deatils are as follows:

Detailed Specification: The idea is to modify list directed output
                        as little as possible to gain connectivity
                        from Fortran programs to desktop applications
                        via CSV format.

                        The proposed solution is:

                        Add a new ACCESS form, ACCESS='CSV' which on output
                        (and has no effect on input)

                        1. Implies ACCESS='STREAM', and

                        2. When list directed, requires that the processor
                           not print the "r*" form of repeated values,
                           and

                        3. When listed directed, disallows blanks as separator
                           (which means comma or semicolon is used as per
                           decimal mode), and

                        4. When listed directed, allows blanks on either side
                           of the separator as at present, and

                        5. When listed directed, disallows new records being
                           created (so one write gives one record),
                           and

                        6. Allows explicit formats to be used as needed.

Straw Votes:

Should CSV be specified:

1. by the OPEN statement?
-or-
2. by the transfer statement?
-or-
3. by some other means?
-or-
4. undecided?

If specified by the OPEN statement (as above), should

1. ACCESS be used?
-or-
2. something else be used?
-or-
3. undecided?
