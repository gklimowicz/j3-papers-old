Subject: expressions and rounding modes
Date: 2008 November 03

The CD 1539-1 specification does not clearly
state which expressions are affected by the
rounding modes.  Note 14.5 (402:14.4) makes
it clear that literal constants are not
affected by rounding modes.  By extension,
array constructors and structure constructors
that include only literal constants and no
operations or functions are also not affected
by rounding modes.

The CD 1539-1 specification does not clearly
say that initialization expressions are not
affected by rounding mode, but it is not clear
what it would mean for data initializations
or bounds and length expressions if they were.

EDIT

Add [402: 14.4p5]
Change of the rounding mode during execution
shall not change the value of any initialization
expressions used in data initializations,
bound specifications, or length expressions.
