NUMBER: F08/0139
TITLE: Is the name of an external procedure that has a binding label
       a local identifier?
KEYWORDS: TRANSFER, zero-sized scalar
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the program fragment:

  Subroutine s() Bind(C,Name='Hello')
      Print *,'Hello'
  End Subroutine
  Subroutine s() Bind(C,Name='World')
    Print *,'World'
  End Subroutine

This does not conform to Fortran 2003, and is not listed as an
extension in the Introduction to Fortran 2008, but the rules for
global names seem to indicate that this is now conforming.

Is this extension deliberate?

ANSWER:

Yes, this was a deliberate change to the Fortran standard.
An edit is provided to mention this in the Introduction.

EDITS:

[xvi] Introduction, paragraph 2, bullet "Programs and procedures",
      append to paragraph
        "The name of an external procedure that has a binding label
         is a local identifier and not a global identifier.".
