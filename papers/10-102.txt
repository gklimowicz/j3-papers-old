When the BITS data type was part of the draft, we introduced an
.xor. operator that acted on a pair of bits objects.  It was extended
to logical operand as well.  When BITS were removed, .xor. was removed
from Tables 7.3, 7.7, and 7.8.  However, there are two places in the
text where .xor. still appears.  This was an oversight in previous
edits; these instances of .xor. should have been removed as well.

Edits to 09-007r3:

[60:18] In 4.4.4 "Logical type", paragraph 6, in the first sentence,
remove ",.XOR.".

[140:6] In 7.1.5.1 "Intrinsic operator classification", paragraph 5,
in the first sentence, remove ".XOR.,".
