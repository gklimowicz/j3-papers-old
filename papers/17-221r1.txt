From: Robert Corbett
Subject: IMPLICIT in BLOCK constructs
Date: 2017 October 12
Reference: 17-007r2

1. Discussion

The draft standard 17-007r2 includes an inadvertent language extension,
namely, it allows IMPLICIT statements in BLOCK constructs.  The
semantics of the extension are unclear in some cases and undesirable in
others.  An edit is provided to remove the extension.

2. Edit to 17-007r2

[186:8] 11.1.4 BLOCK construct, p1
        Delete "[ implicit-part ]".
