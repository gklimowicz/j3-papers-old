Subject: Signed NaN's in I/O

-------------

Page and line references are to 03-007 unless otherwise noted.

The C standard specifies a format for the formatted input and output
of NaN values. 

The description of the fprintf function (page 277 of the C standard)
specifies the output formats as follows:

For the "f" conversion specifier, the output formats include an
optional leading minus sign:

    [-]nan
    [-]nan(n-char-sequence)

For the "F" conversion specifier, the output formats are

    [-]NAN
    [-]NAN(n-char-sequence)

For input using the fscanf function (page 284 of the C standard) the
specified format for NaN's is the same as expected for the subject
sequence of the strtod function (page 307 of the C standard).  That
format is the same as listed above for output except that there can be
an optional leading "+" sign and the case of the letters in the "NAN"
string is ignored.

For interoperability with C it would be desirable to have the Fortran
formatted input/output operations treat these forms as valid.  The
current wording of 03-007 allows these forms except for the possible
leading sign.

Edits:

[230:19] Before "the string" add "an optional sign, followed by".

[230:25] Append "The interpretation of a sign in a NaN input field is
processor dependent."

[230:31] Before "the letters" insert "an optional sign and".

[230:32+3] Append "The presence of the optional sign is
processor dependent."
