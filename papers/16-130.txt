Reference:  16-007
Date: 2016 January 25

[327:11 13.3.1p5] In the last line of 13.3.1p5, insert a comma before
"and".

[328:12+2 NOTE 13.4] In the first line of NOTE 13.4, replace "of these"
with "in the descriptions of".

[328:12+5 NOTE 13.4] The formula at the end of NOTE 13.4 could be the
same as in 13.4p3 because f1 is defined to be nonzero at [328:3].

[331 Table 13.1 EPSILON] Description is not informative.  Replace it
with "Smallest positive model number such that the result of adding it
to 1 is different from 1."

[331 Table 13.1 FRACTION] Insert "floating-point" before number.

[332 Table 13.1 ISHFTC] Replace "of the" with "of the SIZE".

[333 Table 13.1 RANGE] Delete "(13.4)".  It doesn't appear in the
description of most other functions that inquire properties of the
floating-point model, e.g., EPSILON, PRECISION, RADIX, or TINY.

[334 Table 13.1 SPACING] Delete "(13.4)".  It doesn't appear in the
description of most other functions that inquire properties of the
floating-point model, e.g., EPSILON, PRECISION, RADIX, or TINY.

[343:10 13.8.20p3 VALUE] Replace "representable in ATOMIC_INT_KIND" with
"representable by an integer with kind specified by the ATOMIC_INT_KIND
named constant from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module (13.9.2.2)"

[343:24-25 13.8.21p3 VALUE] Replace "representable in ATOMIC_INT_KIND"
with "representable by an integer with kind specified by the
ATOMIC_INT_KIND named constant from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
(13.9.2.2)"

[344:35 13.8.24p3 VALUE] Replace "representable in ATOMIC_INT_KIND" with
"representable by an integer with kind specified by the ATOMIC_INT_KIND
named constant from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module (13.9.2.2)"

[345:9-10 13.8.25p3 VALUE] Replace "representable in ATOMIC_INT_KIND"
with "representable by an integer with kind specified by the
ATOMIC_INT_KIND named constant from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
(13.9.2.2)"

[345:27-28 13.8.26p3 VALUE] Replace "representable in ATOMIC_INT_KIND"
with "representable by an integer with kind specified by the
ATOMIC_INT_KIND named constant from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
(13.9.2.2)"

[346:3-4 13.8.27p3 VALUE] Replace "representable in ATOMIC_INT_KIND"
with "representable by an integer with kind specified by the
ATOMIC_INT_KIND named constant from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
(13.9.2.2)"

[346:21-22 13.8.28p3 VALUE] Replace "representable in ATOMIC_INT_KIND"
with "representable by an integer with kind specified by the
ATOMIC_INT_KIND named constant from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
(13.9.2.2)"

[347:9-10 13.8.30p3 VALUE] Replace "representable in ATOMIC_INT_KIND"
with "representable by an integer with kind specified by the
ATOMIC_INT_KIND named constant from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
(13.9.2.2)"

[351:9 13.8.42p5] Delete "model for the"; insert "described" before "in
13.3".  Compare to, e.g., 13.6.40p6 at [350:19-20].

[360:14 13.8.63p1] Description is not inforative.  Replace it with
"Smallest positive model number such that the result of adding it to 1
is different from 1."

[361:29,33 13.8.67p4] Replace "will have" with "has" twice.  Using "will
have" leaves one to wonder "when will that be?"

[366:43-44 13.8.77p3 LENGTH] Replace "It is processor ... blanks" with
"The significant length may include trailing blanks if the processor
allows command arguments with significant trailing blanks."  Compare to
[366:5-6 13.8.76p3 LENGTH].

[367:31,33 13.8.78p3 VALUE] Move "VALUE is assigned all blanks",
preceded by a comma, to the end of the sentence.  Capitalize first "if".

[367:39 13.8.78p3 STATUS] Replace "set to" with "assigned the value".

[367:40-41 13.8.78p3 STATUS] Delete "STATUS is set to -1".  Capitalize
"if".  Insert ", it is assigned the value -1" after the first
"environment variable".

[367:41-42 13.8.78p3 STATUS] Delete "It is assigned the value 1".
Capitalize "if".  Insert "it is assigned the value 1." after "exist,".

[367:42 13.8.78p3 STATUS] Replace "or 2 if" with "If".  After
"variables" insert "it is assigned the value 2".

[368:23 13.8.79p5] Replace "and" with "or".

[372:5 13.8.88p5] After "collating sequence" insert "associated with the
specified kind type parameter".  Compare to 13.8.44p5 at [351:31-32].

[373:37 13.8.92p5(iv)] The final sentence is wrong.  Replace it with
"The interpretation of a bit sequence with $w_{z-1} = 1$, where $z$ is
the model parameter in 13.3, is processor dependent."

[376:26 13.8.101p3 ARRAY] Before "shall" insert "may be of any type; it"

[377:10 13.8.101p8] Add another example.  Replace "and" with a comma.
Append "and LBOUND (A(2:3,7:10)) is [1,1]".  Without careful reading of
subclause 6 (quite far distant), some readers assume the result would be
[2,7].

[377:37 13.8.103p5] Replace "leftmost" with "most significant".

[378:32 13.8.106p3 STRING_A] Insert "of type" before "default".  Compare
to, e.g., VERIFY, which says "shall be of type character", not "shall be
character".

[379:9 13.8.107p3 STRING_A] Insert "of type" before "default".  Compare
to, e.g., VERIFY, which says "shall be of type character", not "shall be
character".

[379:21 13.8.108p3 STRING_A] Insert "of type" before "default".  Compare
to, e.g., VERIFY, which says "shall be of type character", not "shall be
character".

[380:5 13.8.109p3 STRING_A] Insert "of type" before "default".  Compare
to, e.g., VERIFY, which says "shall be of type character", not "shall be
character".

[389:16+ 13.8.129p3+] Insert a paragraph (or maybe a note):

"If FROM and TO are the same entity, they both become deallocated
because TO is INTENT(OUT)."

{This is the subject of an interp, which it would be nice to moot.}

[390:24 13.8.130p3 S] Append "unless the processor distinguishes
positive zero from negative zero".

[390:29+3 NOTE 13.20] Replace "On many systems there are" with "A
processor might have".  "On many..." is questionable.

[394:29 13.8.139p4] Insert "a" before "scalar".

[397:19 13.8.147] Replace "in" with "on".

[398:35 13.8.150p1] Delete "(13.4)".  It doesn't appear in the
description of most other functions that inquire properties of the
floating-point model, e.g., EPSILON, PRECISION, RADIX, or TINY.

[400:29 13.8.153p5(ii)] Replace "is" with "are".

[402:32 13.8.157p6] Replace "will be" with "is".  Using "will be" raises
the question "When will it be?"

[408:19 13.8.172p1] Delete "(13.4)".  It doesn't appear in the
description of most other functions that inquire properties of the
floating-point model, e.g., EPSILON, PRECISION, RADIX, or TINY.

[409:15 138.8.174p3] Replace "Unless X is complex" with "If X is not
complex" or "If X is real".  We don't usually use "Unless" where there
are only two possibilities.

[412:30 13.8.182p5] Replace "rightmost" with "least significant".

[414:9 13.8.186p3 ARRAY] Before "shall" insert "may be of any type; it"

[414:33 13.8.186p6] Replace "and" with a comma and append ", and
UBOUND ( ( A ) ) is [2,4]".  Without careful reading of subclause 6
(quite far distant), some readers assume the result would be [3,10].

[417:1 13.9.2.1p2] Replace "type" with "types" (there are two now).

[420:17 13.9.20p1] Before "(9.6.4.3)" insert "or the unit used for a
PRINT statement".  Compare to 13.9.2.11 INPUT_UNIT, which specifies that
it applies to a READ statement without a control information list.

[510:37+] Insert a list item:

" o  the values assigned to INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT) arguments to
     some intrinsic subroutines (13)."

Otherwise, we'd need several more list items.

[511:4] After "ERRMSG" insert ", EXITSTAT".

[511:10+] Insert a list item:

" o  the order of command arguments (13.8.77)."

[511:18] Move after [511:20]

[511:20] Replace "(13.6)" with "(13.8.148)".

[511:23] Delete list item for 13.8.177 because it's covered by the one
added at [510:37+].

[511:26] After "(13.9.2)" insert ", and the lengths of those values".

[512:15-16] move to [510:38+].
