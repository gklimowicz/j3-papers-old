TITLE:  IEEE_REM()
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, remainder()
DEFECT TYPE:  ???
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

What is REM(infinity,Y)?  REM(X,0.0)?

What is REM(X,Y) if X and/or Y is NaN?

DISCUSSION:

IEEE-754 requires (in 7.1) both REM(infinity,Y) and REM(X,0.0)
shall be a NaN and raise invalid.

REM(X,Y) when both X and Y are NaN shall be a NaN, and should be
one of NaN arguments.

REM(X,Y) when one of X and Y is a NaN shall be a NaN, and should
the NaN argument.
