Typos:
=====
29:1. Change 'commant' to 'comment'. 

147:11. Add 'or a' before 'WHERE construct'

442:28. Change 'pointer components are' to pointer component is'.
[There is only one pointer component in TYPE cell]

456:14. Change 'An' to either 'A' or 'Another'.

467: All lines that end with '}': Delete that character.

Suggestions:
===========
50: Note 4.29: Add '=> NULL()' after 'ABSTRACT'
[Advocating good programming style to avoid having an undefined ASSOCIATE
status]

In the London WG5 meeting I have a recollection that we decided that
all comparison operators of the old (.EQ.) style be changed to the new
style (==) in notes and examples. I think there are still some out there
that have not been changed yet. Suggestion: Change ALL examples and notes
to have the new style.
