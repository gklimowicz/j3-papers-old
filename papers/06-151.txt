1. Monday, February 13, 2006  9:00 AM
-------------------------------------

    {Monday morning minutes kindness of Dick Hendrickson}

    The J3 meeting (#175) was called to order at 9:00 AM, Monday,
    February 13, 2006, at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA,
    by the J3 chair, Dan Nagle.

    This is a joint meeting of J3 and IS/SC22/WG5, John Reid, convener.
    These minutes record both J3 and WG5 activities, noting when the
    group was in "J3 mode" or "WG5 mode".

1.1 Opening business                              D. Nagle

    Dan opened with thanks to GMU.  Opening introductions of members
    and guests were done.  John Reid is in Boston due to a storm; he
    expects to arrive late this afternoon.  The meeting will be in J3
    mode all day and switch to joint J3/WG5 mode tomorrow.

    The task this week is to go through the 06-010 document and work on
    items for Fortran 2008 that remain.  We want a first draft of edits.
    The timeline calls for next meeting (#176) to be last meeting for new
    edits.  Then there are three meetings to integrate/polish the final
    document.  Then there is one last integration meeting.  

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair                     D. Nagle

    We need to do a response to DARPA about their error processing
    requests from last meeting.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda                         D. Nagle

**  J3 motion: Adopt the agenda as amended (moved by Van Snyder/seconded
               by Rich Bleikamp): passed by unanimous consent {uc}
 
1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 174 minutes            D. Nagle

** J3 motion: Approve paper 05-287, the minutes of meeting #175
              (Bleikamp/Snyder): uc

1.1.4 NCITS/OMC report (if any)                  D. Nagle

    We will need to take brief NCITS ballots tomorrow

1.1.5 ISO/WG5 report                             Van Snyder, IR

    Nothing to report

1.1.6 J11 Liaison report (if any)                C. Rasmussen

    There have been discussions about RESTRICT and that needs to be
    discussed here by subgroup.  About DARPA, the C group does not want
    to define what happens in error conditions.  C++ prefers that users
    write their own exception handler.

1.1.7 H2 Liaison report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    Nothing that affects Fortran

1.1.8 IEEE 754 report (if any)                   M. Ingrassia

    Nothing that affects Fortran; they are trying to decide what to do
    next  

1.1.9 Treasurer's report                         M. North

    Opening balance is $2739.52.  J3 will pay $450 for Wednesday bus.
    There is no meeting fee at this meeting.

2.1 F2008 Plenary (00-010)                        Subgroup Heads

**  The meeting switched to WG5 mode with John Reid as chair

    The WG5 agenda is in N1644.

  1.  Opening of the Meeting

  2.  Opening business

  2.1 Introductory remarks from the Convener

      The tasks for WG5 are to firm up the requirements for Fortran 2008
      and to confirm our intention to adhere to the schedule in N1590.

      WG5 will not be processing any interpretations at this meeting.
      After this meeting, there will be a WG5 ballot on the interpretations
      that are ready to become Fortran 2003 Corrigendum 2.

  2.2 Welcome from the Host

      John Wallin from George Mason University welcomed the group yesterday.

  2.3 Local arrangements

      Local arrangements were described yesterday.

  2.4 Appointments for this meeting

      Jane Sleightholme will be secretary.

      John Reid will be librarian.

      The drafting committee is Muxworthy (head), Takata, Snyder, Walter +
      James, van Waveren.

  2.5 Adoption of the Agenda

      The agenda in N1644 was approved.

  2.6 Approval of the Minutes of the Delft 2005 Meeting [N1631]

      The minutes of the Delft 2005 Meeting in N1631 were approved.

  3.  Matters arising from the minutes

      There were no matters arising of the N1631 minutes.

  4.  Status of Delft 2005 Resolutions [N1630]

      All of the Delft 2005 Resolutions in N1630 were completed.

  5.  Reports

  5.1 SC22 Matters (Convener)

      SC22 wants free standards and Technical Reports to be more freely
      available.

      There is a delay in IEEE 754r: decimal floating-point support.
      Cobol likes the encoding of 3 decimal digits in 10 bits while
      others favor long integers to encode the exponent and mantissa.
      John says that Fortran would support decimal floating-point but he
      doesn't think Fortran cares about the encoding.  There was a J3
      resolution, passed at meeting #174 by unanimous consent, that stated
      J3's support for decimal floating-point and deferred to Cobol about
      the format.

      There was an SC22 resolution requiring iteration with the project
      editor on changes to the draft Standard until there were no changes.

      John Reid was reappointed as WG5 convener for 3 years and Malcolm
      Cohen was appointed as Project Editor for Fortran Part 1.

  5.2 National Activity Reports (Heads of Delegations)

      See N1651 for the BSI report.

      See N1652 for the US report.

      See N1655 for the Japanese report.

      Rob James reported that he is the only one active in Canadian Fortran
      standardization.

      Wolfgang Walter reported that Fortran standardization is inactive in
      Germany.

      Matthijs van Waveren offered no report on Fortran standardization
      activities in the Netherlands.

  5.3 Report from Primary Development Body (NCITS/J3 Chair)

      06-010 reports J3's progress on Fortran 2008 tasks.  06-006A reports
      J3's progress on Fortran interpretations.

  5.4 Reports from other Development Bodies (Editors/Heads)

      There are no other development bodies.

  5.5 Liaison Reports:
    NCITS/H2 (SQL): Dan Nagle
    NCITS/J11 (C): Craig Rasmussen
    IEEE 754 revision: Michael Ingrassia
    IFIP/WG5: Van Snyder
    OpenMp: Matthijs van Waveren

      There were no formal liaison reports.

  6.  Consider the Repository of Requirements (SD5) and make a 
      firm choice of significant features for the next revision, 
      that is, features of severity level 4 and above, as defined in 
      N1594.

  J3/JOR in WG5 mode presented J3 papers and straw votes:

>>  Consider paper 06-109 as a Fortran 2008 task: intended to be purely
    editorial but contains 2 technical changes.  The editorial work is
    difficulty level 2.  It is not in the Fortran 2008 repository of
    requirements N1649.

**  J3 motion: 06-109 "Distinction between model and physical numeric
               representations" accept paragraph 1 as purely editorial
               changes (Whitlock/Ingrassia): uc

    WG5 decided to keep UK-001 "Co-array Fortran for parallel programming"
    on the A list and to keep J3-014 "Intelligent macros" and J3-047 "BITS"
    on the B list.  J3 will keep the latest draft for Co-array edits on the
    J3 server under meeting #176.

  7.  Consider the Fortran defect reports (interpretations) in J3-006 
      and, if appropriate, prepare the second Corrigendum for Fortran 2003. 

    After this meeting, there will be a WG5 ballot on the Fortran
    interpretations that are ready to become Fortran 2003 Corrigendum 2.
    Stan Whitlock will send that subset of 06-006Ar1 to John Reid.

    Corrigendum 1 will be published soon.
