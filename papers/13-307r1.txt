1. Specs and syntax
-------------------

10-187r2 was an interpretation request, asking whether the restrictions
on the DIM argument were necessary.  It was decided that the
restrictions were not necessary, but that the interpretation mechanism
was the wrong vehicle to affect such change.

>From the discussion, question, and answer parts of 10-187r2:

  DISCUSSION:

  Some of the reduction functions have two forms, one with a DIM
  argument and one without; the DIM argument is not optional.  IALL is
  an example.  Other reduction functions have a DIM argument that is
  optional.  COUNT is an example.  The actual argument corresponding to
  the DIM actual argument is prohibited from being an optional dummy
  argument in both cases.  The reason in the case of an optional DIM
  argument is so that the processor can determine the rank of the
  result.  In the case of those with two forms, there is no problem for
  the processor to determine the rank, so the prohibition against the
  corresponding actual argument being an optional dummy argument is
  pointless.  There is already a prohibition against it being an absent
  optional dummy argument in 12.5.2.12p3(4).

  Consider, for example

    subroutine S ( ARRAY, DIM )
      integer, intent(in) :: ARRAY(:,:)
      integer, intent(in), optional :: DIM
      if ( present(dim) ) then
        print *, iall(array,dim)
      else
        print *, iall(array)
      end if
    end subroutine S

  This subroutine clearly does not conform, but a processor would have
  no difficulty determining the rank of the result of IALL(ARRAY,DIM).

  QUESTION:

  (1) Was the pointless restriction intentional, or was it an oversight
  that it did not get removed in the two-form case when MAXLOC etc. were
  added?

  (2) Is it necessary to continue the pointless restriction?

  ANSWER:

  (1) This was an oversight.

  (2) No.  Edits are provided to remove it.
