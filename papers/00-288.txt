Subject: Parent & Child I/O Modes

A user specified derived type I/O procedure maybe called
explicitly by the programmer or implicitly by a DT format
specifier.  It may be called from different data transfer
statements which may be applying different formats,
different units, different records, etc.

Some of these items may be changed by the child but for
others it makes no sense to allow changes.

This paper sets ID, POS, and REC as unchangeable
by a child data transfer routine.

EDITS:

194:19+ add paragraph:
A child data transfer statement shall not specify the ID=,
POS=, or REC= specifiers in an I/O control list.
