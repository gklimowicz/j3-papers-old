Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, the GB comment 29
reads:

(Referencing page 272, 13.7.2.3.1 General, paragraph 1)

As for 13.4 above.


Note that the comment (GB27) relating to 13.4 states:

Edit descriptor EX has inadvertently been omitted from the list
of descriptors which relate to a real variable.


with the suggested edit:

After "ES," insert "EX," twice.


Discussion
----------

We agree.


Edit to N2146
-------------

At page 272, in sub-clause 13.7.2.3 Real and complex editing,
sub-sub-clause 13.7.2.3.1 General, paragraph 1 now reads:

"The F, E, EN, ES, and D edit descriptors specify the editing of real
and complex data. An input/output list item corresponding to an F, E,
EN, ES, or D edit descriptor shall be real or complex. The G, B, O,
and Z edit descriptors also may be used to edit real and complex data
(13.7.5.2.2, 13.7.2.4)."

In the first sentence, after "ES,", add "EX,",
and in the second sentence, after "ES,", add "EX,"

so the resulting paragraph reads:

"The F, E, EN, ES, EX, and D edit descriptors specify the editing of real
and complex data. An input/output list item corresponding to an F, E,
EN, ES, EX, or D edit descriptor shall be real or complex. The G, B, O,
and Z edit descriptors also may be used to edit real and complex data
(13.7.5.2.2, 13.7.2.4)."

{add EX to the list of possible real and/or complex edit descriptors}
