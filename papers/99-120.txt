INTRODUCTION:
-------------
Fixes number 1-3 are miscellaneous fixes for mistakes noticed at this meeting.
Fixes number 4+ are based on paper 99-107.

1. Abstract interfaces have not made it into our definition of "entity", nor
   into our name classes or the list of things exportable from modules.
2. Explicit interface should be required if the result type is a pdt that has
   any nonconstant type parameter value.
3. Allocatable dummies should be prohibited in elemental procedures.
4. The PASS_OBJ dummy variable should not be allocatable.
5. Incorrect term used
