NUMBER: F08/0059
TITLE: Auto-targetting requirements
KEYWORDS: POINTER, TARGET, argument association
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider
  PROGRAM one
    REAL,TARGET :: x = 0
    CLASS(*),POINTER :: p
    p => x    ! (0).
    CALL s(p) ! (1).
    CALL s(x) ! (2).
    PRINT *,x
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE s(q)
      CLASS(*),INTENT(IN),POINTER :: q
      IF (ASSOCIATED(q)) THEN
        SELECT TYPE (q)
        TYPE IS (REAL)
          q = q + 1
        END SELECT
      END IF
    END SUBROUTINE
  END PROGRAM

Clearly everything except statement (2) is standard-conforming.

The statement marked (2) violates the requirement in 12.5.2.5
paragraph 2 for the actual argument to be polymorphic when the dummy
argument is a polymorphic pointer.  However, apart from that
requirement, statement (2) is functionally equivalent to the sequence
(0) then (1), so the "auto-targetting" feature does not need this
requirement.

Was this imposition of this requirement (which is needed when both the
actual and the dummy are pointers) an oversight in this case?

Note that similar considerations apply to
   CHARACTER(100),TARGET :: actual
   CHARACTER(:),POINTER,INTENT(IN) :: dummy
in that the pointer assignment would be valid, but the requirements
in 12.5.2.5 paragraph 5 are not met.

ANSWER:

Yes, the imposition of these requirements to the auto-targetting
feature was an oversight.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

EDIT:

[295:16-17] In 12.5.2.5, Replace paragraph  with
  "The requirements in this subclause apply to an actual argument
   with the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute and that corresponds to
   a dummy argument with the same attribute."
{Except for paragraph 4, all these requirements are unnecessary when
 auto-targetting is happening.  Note that 12.5.2.5p6 is moot because
 a coindexed object is not permitted in auto-targetting as it is not
 a valid target in a pointer assignment (C725).}

[296:4-5] Delete paragraph 12.5.2.5p4 and reinsert twice,
          once at [296:12+] as a new paragraph after 12.5.2.6p3, and
          once at [296:35] as a new sentence at the end of 12.5.2.7p3.
{Duplicate the bit about assumed type parameters.}
