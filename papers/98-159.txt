       Subject: ASYNC and Host Association
       Date: 98-05-27
       
       JOR has decided to add the ASYNCHRONOUS statememt to the
       list of statements that, when used in an internal procedure,
       disable host association and create a local variable.  JOR
       believes all the type declaration/attribute statements now
       have this property.
       
       Edits against 98-007r1:
       
       Section 14.6.1.3 [310:34], in the big list, in list
       item 2, change 
         "<save-stmt>" to "<save-stmt>, <asynchronous-stmt>"
       
       

       Note that we'll add the <volatile-stmt> here later.
