Subject: ADVANCE= specifier in child data transfer statements

NUMBER: 
TITLE: ADVANCE= specifier in child data transfer statements
KEYWORDS: ADVANCE=, UDDTIO, data transfer
DEFECT TYPE: 
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The appearance of the ADVANCE= specifier in a child data transfer
statement is not prohibited, but such an appearance is meaningless.
9.5.3 of Fortran 2003 states that the file is positioned after data
transfer only if the statement is not a child data transfer.  The
appearance of the ADVANCE= specifier in such a statement would seem to
serve only to confuse people maintaining a program that contains it.

Was it intended that the ADVANCE= specifier should be allowed to
appear in a child data transfer statement?


ANSWER:

I can think of two options for this answer:

OPTION 1:
No, it was not intended that the ADVANCE= specifier should be allowed
to appear in a child data transfer statement.  An edit is supplied to
correct this oversight.

OPTION 2:
Yes, it was intended that the ADVANCE= specifier should be allowed to
appear in a child data transfer statement.  Such a specifier has no
effect.


EDITS:

OPTION 1:
All edits refer to 04-007.
[189:9+]  Add the following sentence:
              A child data transfer statement shall not specify the
              ADVANCE= specifier.

OPTION 2:
None.
