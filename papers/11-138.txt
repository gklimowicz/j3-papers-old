I have been looking at TR7, and can see nothing that isn't already in
N1838.  Whether I was the person who raised the question or not, I
wasn't the person who raised the issue - if I recall, it is there
because people weren't absolutely sure that all of the necessary the
wording covered all of the necessary requirements and constraints.

11-114 has already taken the exclusion for allocatable and pointer
arrays on board.

Unless someone can spot an omission that I have missed, I suggest
that this is closed as already done.
