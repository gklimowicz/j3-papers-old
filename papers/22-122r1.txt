Subject: Enumeration type constructor
Date: 2022-March-03
Reference: 22-007

Subgroup declines to extend the enumeration type constructor at this time.
It further notes that no additional functionality is being proposed.

The type of an <enumeration-constructor> is explicitly stated in the first
sentence following its BNF rule. Some wordsmithing may be appropriate to
make this easier to read, but that will be deferred to an editorial paper.
