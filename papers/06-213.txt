Subject: C4 - UTI 14, 15 : definition of bits compatible / TKR
Date:    28-jul-2006

---------------------

Unresolved Technical Issue 14 (page 44) observes that the definition
of "bits compatible" is unrelated to the CLASS type specifier and
should be moved elsewhere.  This Issue also proposes that the
definition of TKR compatible belongs elsewhere. That issue is
addressed in the paper for UTI 17.

Unresolved Technical Issue 15 (page 45) proposes an alternate wording
for the definition of "bits compatible" that correctly includes both
scalars and arrays.

Edits:
------

[44:31-32] Remove this sentence.

[271:18] Following "bits compatible" add a forward reference
"(12.5.1.3a)" to the new location of the definition of bits
compatible.

[312:3+] Add a new subclause:

"12.5.1.3a Compatibility with bits objects

An entity is <<bits compatible>> with another entity if and only if
one is of type bits, the other is of type bits, integer, real,
complex, or logical, and scalar entities of these types have the same
size expressed in bits."

[510:10+] Add a new Glossary entry:

"<<bits compatible>> (12.5.1.3a) : An entity is bits compatible
with another entity if and only if one is of type bits, the other is
of type bits, integer, real, complex, or logical, and scalar entities
of these types have the same size expressed in bits."
