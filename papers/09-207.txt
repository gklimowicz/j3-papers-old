1. Discussion

7.2.1.3p3 [09-007r1:156:10] requires an unallocated variable in an
intrinsic assignment to have the same rank as <expr>.

Presumably, if the ranks differ, the processor is expected to produce a
runtime error message and stop the program.

It would be easier on processors if 7.2.1.3p3 specified that if <expr>
is scalar and variable is an unallocated allocatable array, variable is
allocated with all upper and lower bounds equal to 1.

[156:10 7.2.1.3p3]======================================================
Editor: Delete the first sentence: "If the variable ... rank."

[156:16-18 7.2.1.3p3]====================================================
Editor: Replace the third list item:

"  o if the variable is an array that was allocated and became
     deallocated, and <expr> is scalar, the same bounds as before,

   o if the variable is an array that was unallocated and <expr> is
     scalar, all lower and upper bounds equal to 1, and"

or

"  o if <expr> is scalar and
     -- variable is an array that was allocated and became deallocated,
        the same bounds as before, or
     -- variable is an array that was unallocated, all lower and upper
        bounds equal to 1, and"
