Comments and edits for 22-007 / CD 1539-1

The r0 version of this paper had commentary/edits for issues
with <actual-arg> / "argument list" and the glossary entry for the
latter.  Malcolm's paper 22-143 addresses this issue.

--- edits to the FOREWORD and INTRODUCTION ---
[xii:2] Foreword, 2nd paragraph,
(check to see if ISO boilerplate has changed, I'm hoping
"types of document" is changed to "types of documents").

[xiii:2] Introduction, "Fortran 202x contains ...", the bulleted item
that starts with
 "Intrinsic Modules:
  Additional Named Constants ...",

    replace
      "from the intrinsic module IEEE_ARITHMETIC,"
    with
      ", from the intrinsic module IEEE_ARITHMETIC,"

    Occurs twice in that bulleted item.

[xiv:2] Introduction, 2nd paragraph, the 8th bulleted item, that
starts with "Changes to the intrinsic module IEEE_ARITHMETIC",
note: line 2 started on the previous page,

  Change "perform the the" to "perform the"

[2, Normative references, ISO/IEC 9899:2011, [2:7]]
    Was the choice of the 2011 standard for the C programming language
    intentional, or should we reference ISO/IEC 9899:2018?

    Malcolm noted that if we want to update the C standard version,
    we need to check all references to 9899 to see if subclause #'s we
    reference have changed.  Does someone have the relevant C
    standards to check?  (no edits proposed until someone can check
    references to subclause #s)

[2, Normative references, [2:9]] (IEEE stuff)
    change
        "ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011"
    to
        "ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2020"
