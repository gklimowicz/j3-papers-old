Subject: Assumed character length in type guard statements

KEYWORDS: CHARACTER, assumed length, type guard, SELECT TYPE

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        CHARACTER, TARGET :: c
        CLASS(*), POINTER :: p

        p => c
        SELECT TYPE (p)
          TYPE IS (CHARACTER(*))
            PRINT *, 'Character of length ', LEN(p)
        END SELECT
      END

Constraint C814 says that, in a type guard statement, the <type-spec>
shall specify that each length type parameter is assumed.

Constraint C416 does not list a type guard statement as a context in
which "*" can be used as a length type parameter for a character.

Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?


ANSWER:
Yes, this program was intended to be standard-conforming.  Edits are
supplied to correct this oversight.

[41:33+] Add a new list item:
         "(3.5) If used in the <type-spec> of a type guard statement,
         the associating entity assumes the length type parameter from
         the dynamic type of the selector."
