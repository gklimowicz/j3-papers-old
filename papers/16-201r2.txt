========

[123:11-12 C616] Delete C616 because it is entirely redundant to C524,
which prohibits a coarray to be of the types prohibited by C616,
and C614, which requires the object to be a coarray if an image selector
appears.

[129:21+ C628+] Insert a constraint"

  "C628a (R624) TEAM and TEAM_NUMBER shall not both appear in the same
         <image-selector-spec-list>."

[131:8+ C634+] Move C643 and C644 [131:22-24] after C634 to put
<type-spec> constraints together.

[132:7-10 6.7.1.1p4] After "shall not have a <source-expr>" turn the
 remainder of the paragraph into a list:

"  o with a dynamic type...,
   o which has a subcomponent whose dynamic type is..., or
   o which has a coarray ultimate component.
"

[132:32 6.7.1.2p3] Replace "If ... coarray, its" with "Its".  Move the
second sentence, viz. "The values of ... images" before the first
sentence.  Join p3 to p2.

[133:5-7 6.7.1.2p8] Delete "If the value ... error condition occurs."
because it is essentially identical to the second sentence in 6.7.1.1p6.

[134:20 6.7.2p1] Delete 6.7.2p1.

[134:27+ 6.7.2p2+] Insert a paragraph:

"Execution of a NULLIFY statement causes each <pointer-object> to become
disassociated."

[134:27+2 NOTE 6.21] After "becomes the" insert "same as its".
