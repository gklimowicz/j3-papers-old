TITLE:  Internal procedure in a generic interface
KEYWORDS: Internal procedure, Generic interface
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

In Fortran 2003, an internal subprogram was not allowed to define a
specific procedure for a generic identifier:

Fortran 2003 [285:14-15]
C1207 (R1206) A <procedure-name> shall have an explicit interface and
      shall refer to an accessible procedure pointer, external
      procedure, dummy procedure, or module procedure.

Paper 08-178 proposed the new feature of permitting an internal
procedure in this context, and this was included in Fortran 2008:

[Fortran 2008 281:8]
C1207 (R1206) A <procedure-name> shall be a nonintrinsic procedure that
      has an explicit interface.

However, this new feature was not mentioned in the Introduction of
Fortran 2008, nor is it mentioned in Annex C.1 of Fortran 2018
(which lists Fortran 2008 features not originally mentioned in its
Introduction).

Should this be mentioned in Annex C.1?

ANSWER:

Yes, this new feature should be mentioned in Annex C.1.

An edit is provided.

EDIT:

[528:22+] C.1 Fortran 2008 features not mentioned in its
          Introduction, p1,

Insert an item at the end of the bullet list:

  - An internal procedure name can appear in a <procedure-stmt> in a
    generic interface block.
