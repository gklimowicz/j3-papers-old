Subject: CHANGE/END TEAM not branch target?
Date: 2020-October-11

NUMBER: F18/0022
TITLE: CHANGE TEAM and END TEAM are not branch target statements
KEYWORDS: CHANGE TEAM branch target
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the code fragment:

        IF (condition) GO TO 100
        ...
    100 CHANGE TEAM (x)
            ...
            IF (condition2) GO TO 200
            ...
    200 END TEAM

This seems anodyne enough to be unobjectionable, but the CHANGE TEAM
and END TEAM statements are not listed in the definition of branch
target statement in 3.18 nor in the list in 11.2.1 Branch concepts.

Are CHANGE TEAM and END TEAM intended to be valid branch targets?

ANSWER:

A, Yes, these statements were intended to be valid as branch targets;
   their omission from the list of branch target statements was
   inadvertent.

Edits are provided to correct this omission.

EDITS to 18-007r1:

[5:36] 3.18 branch target statement,
       before "<critical-stmt>"
       insert "<change-team-stmt>, <end-team-stmt>,".

[196:26] 11.2.1 Branch concepts, p1,
         before "<critical-stmt>"
         insert "<change-team-stmt>, <end-team-stmt>,".
