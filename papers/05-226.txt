NUMBER: F03/0064
TITLE: Recursive declaration of procedure interfaces
KEYWORDS: procedure, interface
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        PROCEDURE(sub) :: p
        INTERFACE
          SUBROUTINE sub(p2)
            IMPORT p
            PROCEDURE(p) :: p2
          END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE
      END PROGRAM

C1212 appears to prohibit the case of an interface name in a procedure
declaration statement being the name of something declared in a later
procedure declaration statement.  But it does not appear to prohibit
the case of an interface name being the name of something declared in
a later interface body.

In the above program, the characteristics of p rely on the
characteristics of sub.  The characteristics of sub, in turn, rely on
the characteristics of p.

Is this program standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this program is not standard-conforming.  The interface name in a
procedure declaration statement should not be permitted to be declared
in a later interface body.  An edit is supplied to correct this
oversight.
