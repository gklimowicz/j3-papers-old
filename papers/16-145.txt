There are no edits here.  Maybe some are needed.

[498:21 16.5.3.2p2(6)] Does a derived type object with no components
(and no length type parameters?) occupy any storage units?

[501:15 16.6.2] Are zero-size subobjects always defined?  If so, should
that be addressed in 16.6.2, or in a new subclause?

[501:15 16.6.2] Is a derived type object with no components
(and no length type parameters?) always defined?

[503:12 16.6.5p1(21)] Do we need this list item?  According to 16.6.2,
zero-size arrays and zero-length strings are always defined.

[503:15-18 16.6.5p1(23-24)] Do zero-size subobjects become defined?  Or
are they always defined?  16.6.2 does not concern subobjects.

[503:23-25 16.6.5p1(27)] Do zero-size subobjects become defined?  Or
are they always defined?  16.6.2 does not concern subobjects.
