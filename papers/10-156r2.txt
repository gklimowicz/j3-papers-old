NUMBER: F03/0009
TITLE: Is ABS ever required to be the optional IEC 60559 abs?
KEYWORDS: ABS, IEEE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Are there any circumstances where the Fortran standard requires
the intrinsic function ABS to be compliant with the function abs
described in the optional portion of IEC 60559?

DISCUSSION:

Chapter 14 of F2008 does not define an IEEE_ABS intrinsic as a
separate IEEE version of ABS and the example given in Section
14.11.3p7 [409:26] requires that ABS comply with the function
abs specified in the optional portion of IEC 60559.  We infer
that the standard intended for the ABS intrinsic to be compliant
with the IEC 60559 definition.

ANSWER:

Yes, the Fortran standard requires the intrinsic function ABS
to be compliant with the function abs described in IEC 60559.

An edit is provided to make that explicit.

EDITS to 10-007:

In 13.7.2p5 [326:4+] add a new sentence to the end of the paragraph:

  "If A is real and IEEE_SUPPORT_STANDARD (A) is true, then the
   intrinsic function ABS (A) is compliant with the function abs
   described in IEC 60559."
