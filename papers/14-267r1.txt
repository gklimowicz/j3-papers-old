A constraint is apparently needed:

"C507a (R503) A <coselector-name> shall be the name of an accessible
              coarray."

Response:
The edit Van provided is adopted.

Isn't the image that executes the SYNC IMAGES, LOCK, UNLOCK
or EVENT POST statement involved?  If so, replace the sentences with
something like "In addition to the image that executes a SYNC IMAGES
statement, the other images specified in its <image-set> are involved.
Other than the image that executes a LOCK or UNLOCK statement, the image
on which the referenced lock variable is located is involved.  Other
than the image that executes an EVENT POST statement, the image on which
the referenced event variable is located is involved."

We think the  text should be more precise as Van suggested.

An edit is provided.
