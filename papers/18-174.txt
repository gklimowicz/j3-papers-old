1. Discussion

Comment DE-009 surmises:

Constraint C837 appears to not exclude the
following:
REAL, ALLOCATABLE :: A(..)
REAL, POINTER :: B(..)
REAL, TARGET :: BT(:,:)
IF (RANK(A) == 2 .AND. RANK(B) == 2) THEN
B => BT
ALLOCATE(A(2,2))
END IF

Response: C837 states
  "An assumed-rank variable name shall not appear in a designator or
   expression except..."

A designator is "name followed by zero or more component selectors..."

The appearances of "B" in "B=>BT" and "A" in "ALLOCATE(A(2,2))" are both
variable designators, and these contexts are not listed as permissible by
C837.

2. Response to DE-009.

Rejected, as C837 covers the cases that should be forbidden already.
