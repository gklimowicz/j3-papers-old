Subject: Unresolved issue 323
Date: 21st May 2001

1. Introduction

Issue 323 says
  "The type parameter keyword definition doesn't include structure
   constructors."
The editor comments that he
  "doesn't see where type parameter keywords are used in structure
   constructors other than in a derived type specifier (which is covered)."

I concur.

Issue 323 also says, apropos type parameter keywords,
  "A glossary entry is also needed."

Actually, I don't really see the need to clutter up the glossary with
this sort of trivia, but since we did it for the other keywords I guess
we should do it for this one.

2. Edits to 01-007r1

[19:11-18] Delete J3 note 323.

[407:43+] Insert new entry
"<<type parameter keyword>> (2.5.2): A type parameter name.  It may be used
in
 a derived-type specifier (4.5.7)  to indicate the type parameter for which
a
 value is specified."
