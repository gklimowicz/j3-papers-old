Subject: UK-02 default accessibility of entities
Date: 2013 October 14

Reference: N1975, N1982

1. Specification

a. In a module, the default accessibility of entities from another module
   accessed by use association should be decoupled from the default
   accessibility of entities defined by the using module.

b. This should be done by a separate statement, not on the USE statement,
   to avoid confusion when multiple USE statements for a module appear.

c. Multiple specifications of the default accessibility shall not be
   permitted.

d. Specification of accessibility shall not be permitted for a module that
   is not referenced by a USE statement.

2. Syntax

a. Permit a module name to appear in a PUBLIC or PRIVATE statement.

b. At most one appearance of a module name in all the PUBLIC and PRIVATE
   statements in a module specification part is permitted.

3. Edits to 10-007r1

[intro] Update the new feature list
  "In a module, the default accessibility of entities accessed from
   another module can be controlled separately from that of entities
   declared in the using module."

[102:27] "<use-name>" -> "<access-name>".
{Remove useless sharing of term with the USE statement.}

[102:31] "<use-name>" -> "<access-name>",
         "named" -> "module".
{Remove useless sharing etc.  Replace unnecessary verbiage with
 the extra syntax.}

[102:32+] add two constraints
  "C563a A module whose name appears in an <access-stmt> shall be
         referenced by a USE statement in the scoping unit that contains
         the <access-stmt>.
   C563b The name of a module shall appeat at most once in all the
         <<access-stmt>>s appearing in a module."
{Required constraints, worded so as not to require a syntax rule ref.}

[102:34] after "in the list" insert
  "that is not a module name.  Appearance of a module name in an
  <access-stmt> specifies the default accessibility of entities accessed
  from that module.".
{Remove modules from receiving the attribute, add sentence for semantics.}
