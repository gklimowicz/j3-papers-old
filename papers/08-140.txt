Date: 2008 February 26

1. General Editorial Changes

Line numbering turned off for this revision.

Made the 007 text part wider and taller, without changing the margins.

2. Meeting Paper Details

08-105r2:
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 134.

08-106r3
  [575:11] "type REAL"->"real type" and "type COMPLEX"->"complex type".
  [576:10] Similarly.
  [577:28] Second insert before ref instead of after.
  Done.

08-107r1:
  [12:25] Actually deleted "of the type" for this one.
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 123.

08-108r2:
  Done.

08-109r1:
  [439:8] Deleted "that is,", and appended "; this is equivalent to" plus
          the expression.
  [439:16] Rejected.  This is redundant and would make the sentence
           too confusing to read (confusion re which expression has
           what value).

08-110:
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 144.

08-111r1:
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 145.

08-112r1:
  Sorry, cannot do the "do not start a new paragraph here";
  LaTeX automatically begins a new paragraph after a list end.
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 135.

08-114r1:
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 150.

08-115r1:
  [446:20] Did to line 18 instead (line 20 has been deleted).
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 136.

08-116r1:
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 146.

08-117:
  [345:31+] Sorted CMPLX and DBLE, "REAL"->"the intrinsic function REAL"
            twice, "those functions"->"those intrinsic functions".
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 148.

08-118r2:
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 149.

08-119:
  Done.
  Deleted UTI 133.

08-123:
  Done.

08-124r1:
  Done.

08-125 part 2:
  Also changed "non-co-array" to "noncoarray" in accordance with our style.
  Also changed <co-name> to <coarray-name>.
  Done.

08-129r1:
  [221:14-16] This was done in conjunction with 08-131, so got changed
              quite a lot.
  [239:12] Omitted the reference to (9.5.1) as it appears a few lines
           earlier.
  Done.

08-130r2:
  Done with rewording.
  Deleted UTI 080.

08-131r1:
Actually, I've put the deletions under featuretests Team and TeamIO.
  [xv:2+] I'm ignoring this because this page is being rewritten anyway.
  EXTRA EDIT: [34:3] Deleted.
  [203:15] Also changed ";" to "." on line 14.
  [210:2-4, 210:10-11, 211:2] Fixed the list syntax.
  [221:16] Did a completely different edit because the paragraph text is
           replaced by 08-129r1, and the stuff about ERROR_UNIT is in the
           wrong place (that unit is discussed in the NEXT paragraph, not
           this one).  Probably got the technical content right.  At
           least I hope I didn't type "intput unit".
  [226:21] Reverted to pre-coarray text instead.
  [507:1-508:15] Deleted all of B.1 instead.
                 BTW, this was previously not ISO-conformant.
  [557:26-558:18] BTW, this is now not ISO-conformant.
  Thanks for the unrelated editorial corrections.
  BTW, I actually worked off of 08-131, not the post-r1.

08-132:
  EXTRA EDIT [71:7] Deleted "with a <component-array-spec>".
  Comment: This bears further simplification, but it's a start.
  EXTRA EDIT [72:-1] Deleted "with a \si{coarray-spec}".
  Comnet: Further simpliciation avoilable, but this is a start.
  [93:21+] No.  Dimension reverts to "DIMENSION ( <array-spec>)" so we
           get "CODIMENSION <lbracket> <coarray-spec> <rbracket>",
           no unnecessary middle terms necessary.
  [94:3-4] "apperance"->"appearance"; interestingly enough, this was wrong
           before.
  [97:20+] Omitted the unnecessary intermediate term.  Omitted the
           (broken) constraint which is correctly stated already in C535.
           Did not add the BROKEN version of <coarray-spec> in the paper,
           instead moved the ALREADY-CORRECT version from 99:15-16 to
           immediately follow the first paragraph of the subclause, like
           we normally do for attribute.  (The previous ordering was a
           mess, with constraints preceding the syntax.)  Looking at the
           paper I think you just forgot to do anything with 99:15-16.
  EXTRA EDIT: I moved the rank+corank<=15 constraint to the CODIMENSION
    subclause, and in the DIMENSION subclause inserted a note which says
    the same thing in different words.
  [98:25-28] Instead, replaced with the noncoarray version which uses
             slightly different wording.
  EXTRA EDIT: [99:2-3] Deleted broken constraint C524 (C535 said correctly
                       what this was trying to say).
  [113:4] Instead, reverted to the noncoarray version which doesn't use an
          intermediate BNF term.
  Also moved what is now Note 5.6 down slightly to put it with the other
  notes at the end of the subclause (as per ISO guidelines).
  Done.

08-134:
  Done.

3. Additional Editorial Changes

[intro] Re-sorted the annex list.
[18:28-33] Moved "standard intrinsic" and "nonstandard intrinsic" to the
           right place.
[23:12-17] Made "structure component" and "structure constructor" subterms
           of "structure".
[23:26-27] Wording change (hopefully improvement).
[31:22] Fixed "programss".
[32] Put the whole of the ENTRY line in the table into \obs font.
[36:2] Inserted missing space.
[63:28-29] Rewrote pseudo-requirement into a statement of fact.
[63:31] "defined"->"specified".
[77:39] Inserted missing "attribute".
[100:6+,18] Added a paragraph saying what an explicit-shape array really
  is, and moved the sentence about rank to it.
[102:2] Unbolded "implicit-shape array" since it is used 5 times in this
        subclause and zero times in the whole rest of the standard.
        Retained its indexing though.
[204:7+2] "halt"->"suspend".

[in c10] Various font and hyperlink fixups (missing hyperlinks, items in
         syntax font that ought not to have been, vice versa, etc.).
[in c13] changed "X intrinsic function" to "intrinsic function X" etc.
         for consistency.
