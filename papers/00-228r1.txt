        to derived type i/o routines specified as type-bound
        procedures, but desires one addition:

            An explicit interface, as described in 9.5.4.4.3, should
            override any type-bound DTIO procedure.

5.3.5 Comments from members

        Kurt: Do we need to assemble the minutes into 1 physical
              document?   Tony said NO.
        Kurt: drop appendix F from the minutes, and insert a pointer
              (full web addresses) to the 001 standing document.
              Kurt will still prepare appendix E for the minutes.

        Mallory: Rose Hulman has a web person willing to do all of
                 J3's stuff (email, web pages, archive), we will
                 move all that to Rose Hulman.  Will investigate
                 getting fortran.org or j3.fortran.com, so future
                 moves will be less painful.  Spam removal will be
                 investigated.

        Matthijs: Wants a list of papers to send to Mr. Kruyt:  JOR
                  sent email, data prepared 00-222.
