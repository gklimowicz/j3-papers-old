Subject: Comment DE 031 - coarrays inside CHANGE TEAM
Date: 2017 October 16
References: N2137, N2141

Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DE 031 requests adding a NOTE to the end of section 11.1.5 that explains
how coarrays established in an ancestor team are handled inside the
block of a CHANGE TEAM construct. This paper supplies the edit needed to
implement that NOTE, with a modification suggested by John Reid.

Edit to N2137:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[188:31+] At the end of section 11.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM
construct, after NOTE 11.6 (end of page 188), add a new Note:

"NOTE 11.6+

A coarray that is established when a CHANGE TEAM statement is executed
will retain its corank and cobounds inside the construct block. However,
the cosubscripts in an image selector for the coarray will be mapped to
an image index of the team of the image selector, which by default is
the current team, see 9.6.

If it is desired to perform remote accesses based on corank or
cobounds different from those of the original coarray, an associating
coarray can be used.  Appendix C.6.7 supplies an illustration of this.

If it is desired to perform accesses that retain the mapping of
cosubscripts to image indices of an ancestor team, that team can be
specified as the TEAM= argument in the image selector. This mechanism
also permits accessing a coarray on an image that is not a member of
the current team."
