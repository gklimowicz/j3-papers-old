Subject: Disposition of glossary
Date: 2007 September 27

1. Introduction
---------------
The glossary (Annex A) has been deleted.  It contained many bad items
(every page had multiple items that were incorrect, misleading, or only
partial definitions).  A number of items were simple English (why someone
thought Fortran would have a unique definition of "datum" I do not know).
A number were just unnecessary ("assignment statement").  Lots of technical
terms were missing ("assumed type parameter").

Finally, the glossary has been subsumed by the normative text of c02.

This document records the disposition of each item in the previous
glossary.

2. Categorisation
-----------------
defined - is a defined term in c02.
DELETED - word/term is
          (a) ordinary English,
          (b) universally understood,
          (c) not a defined term,
          (d) only used near its definition and the glossary version is
              bad in some way, or
          (d) not even used in the standard anyway.
MOOT - only used by a feature that has been removed
SUBSUMED by - included in or rendered unnecessary by another defined term
UNNECESSARY - does not need explanation and
              does not need to be a defined term

The main differences between "DELETED" and "UNNECESSARY" are:
(a) DELETED means it got deleted from aa.tex (aa.tex still exists, it is
    just not being included in the 007);
(b) most of the deletions were done before I decided that I would just go
    ahead and delete the whole glossary this time anyway;
(c) some of the deletions were done afterwards when I thought the entry
    was so bad that I didn't want it hanging around in any way;
(d) some of the UNNECESSARY classifications are more borderline so might
    be open to question (but even there, indexing and cross-referencing
    are probably better than making defined terms that end up hardly
    being used).
