From: Dan Nagle
Subject: Minimum-width Character Format

I Introduction

When one combines static-length character variables with the convenience
of A format, one finds trim() around the output list item.



II Use-cases

For a scalar, this is not much more than a nuisance.
For example,

character( 1000) :: buffer
...
write( ..., '( a)') trim( buffer)

But trim() is transformational (since it may change a length).
So it cannot be applied to an array appearing in an output list.
Thus, an implied-do becomes the easiest way forward, as here,

character( 100), dimension( nflags) :: flags
integer :: i
...
write( ..., '( a)') ( trim( flags( i)), i = 1, nflags)

If the character array to be written is supplied by a function reference,
then a new character variable must be used to subscript the elements
for trim().  Thus, a block becomes the easiest way forward, as here,

just_a_trim: block
   character( right_len), dimension( right_size) :: usage_msg
   integer :: i

   usage_msg = options% get_usage_message()

   write( ..., '( a)') ( trim( usage_msg( i)), i = 1, right_size)

end block just_a_trim

While judicious use of allocatable character variables might alleviate
some of the symptoms, a better and broader cure is desirable.

If a minimal-width character format descriptor were available, say A0,
these gyrations would not be necessary.  The effect
of this format descriptor is to trim blanks from the list item prior
to printing.

Note that, with A0, the three write statements above may be written,
write( ..., '( a0)') buffer
write( ..., '( a0)') flags
write( ..., '( a0)') options% get_usage_message()

I take this as an improvement.



III What I have in mind

I propose that an A0 edit descriptor be added.  The effect on output
is to trim before writing.  The effect on input is as A.

There has not been a consensus regarding whether A0 should "trim
on the left", that is, trim leading as well as trailing blanks.
This should be subject of a straw vote.

Straw Vote:
Should the effect of A0 be:
Remove trailing blanks only
Remove leading and trailing blanks
Undecided

trailing only- the 99% weight case
leading & trailing- w=0 => minimum width

I'm quite ambivalent.



IV (Rough) Requirements

1. A format descriptor be provided that formats character output
without trailing blanks.  Subject to the straw vote above, it may
remove leading blanks as well.
