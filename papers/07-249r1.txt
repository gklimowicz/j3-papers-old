TITLE:    Final subroutine and VALUE attribute
KEYWORDS: Final subroutine, VALUE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS:   J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:

Currently, the F03 standard allows the VALUE attribute to be specified
for the dummy argument of a final subroutine.  This seems to defeat
the purpose of final subroutine, which is intended to apply to the
finalizable entity (the actual argument) itself.

Should the dummy argument of a final subroutine be allowed to have the
VALUE attribute?

ANSWER:

No, the VALUE attribute should not be allowed.
An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

EDITS to 04-007:

[58:14] Replace "not be INTENT(OUT)"
        with "not have the INTENT(OUT) or VALUE attribute".
