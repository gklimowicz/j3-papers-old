1. Introduction
===============

This was originally in 14-143r1, which didn't get processed at 204.

4.5.2.2p1 is nearly identical to the first two sentences of 5.3.2p2, the
only difference being that 4.5.2.2p1 is specialized for type names
instead of identifiers.

There are cross references from 9.11.5 to 13.8.2.13 and 13.8.2.14 for
IOSTAT_END and IOSTAT_EOR, but none to 13.8.2.15 for
IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT.

Note 13.1 uses the term "atomic variables", but this term is not used
anywhere else (because Fortran has no such concept).  It should be
"variables using atomic subroutines".

That the effects of calling COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT,
EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE, GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, and
GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE on any image other than image 1 [in the initial
team after TS 81508] are processor dependent, is discussed in 13.5p3.
Subclause 13.5 should contain only summaries and generalities, not
specifics.  Considerations concerning invoking a procedure on other than
image 1 [in the initial team after TS 81508] ought to be discussed in
descriptions of the individual procedures, in subclauses 13.7.37,
13.7.58, 13.7.66, 13.7.67, and 13.7.68.

[After discussion at m205, edits regarding the command line inquiry
intrinsics are removed from this paper and will be taken up at a future
meeting.]

The interleaving of calls to any procedure in unordered segments is
processor dependent (although a standard-conforming program cannot
observe this).  It does not depend upon whether a processor uses a
common random number generator.  The final sentence of 13.5p4 is not
even informative.  Indeed, one might wonder "Since it's said here and
not elsewhere, is it perhaps untrue elsewhere?"

That the results of CPU_TIME, DATE_AND_TIME, and SYSTEM_CLOCK might be
dependent on which image calls them, is discussed in 13.5p5.
Similarly, these discussions ought to be in subclauses 13.7.43, 13.7.45,
and 13.7.167.

13.5p6 doesn't say anything useful, since the consideration applies to
all procedures, not only "all other standard intrinsic procedures."

An ASSOCIATE CONSTRUCT might have several associations; "the associate
name" is therefore ambiguous.

The list items at [482:38-40] concerning subclause 13.7.67 are followed
by items with smaller subclause numbers.  They should be put into
subclause order.

2. Edits to 14-007r2
====================

[64:23-25] Delete 4.5.2.2p1.

[64:26 4.5.2.2p2]  Prepend a sentence:

"Accessibility of a type name is determined as specified in 5.3.2."

[244:5-6 9.11.5p1 second list item] After IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT
insert "(13.8.2.15)" for consistently with [244:10] and [244:12].  Delete
"from the intrinsic module IOSTAT_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2)".

[321:16 13.1p3] Replace "atomic variables" with "affected variables".
(The term "atomic variables" is not defined or used elsewhere in the
standard.)

[321:17+2 Note 13.1] Replace "use atomic variables" with "use atomic
subroutines".

[329:1-3 13.5p3] Delete the paragraph "The effects of calling
COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT...".  The description reappears later.

[329:7-8 13.5p4] Delete "On images ... dependent."  The description
reappears later.

[329:9-330:2 13.5p5-6] Delete the paragraphs and Note 13.8.  The
descriptions reappear later.

[346:6+ 13.7.43p3] Append a sentence:

  "Whether the value assigned to TIME depends upon which image invokes
   the subroutine is processor dependent.  Whether the value assigned to
   TIME is a per-image value or per-program value is processor
   dependent."

[347:40+ 13.7.45p3+] Insert a paragraph:

   "A clock may be available on some images and not others.  If a clock
    is available on more than one image, it is processor dependent
    whether or not all images share the same clock or time zone
    information."


[358:6+ 13.7.68p3+] Append a paragraph:

   "The existence and values of environment variables may vary
   across images."

[387:8+ 13.7.138p3] Append a sentence:

  "If images use a common random number generator, the sequences of
   values assigned to the HARVEST argument in unordered segments are
   processor dependent."

[400:7 13.7.167p3] Replace "the processor clock" with "a processor
 clock"

[400:15+ 13.7.167p3+] Insert a paragraph:

  "The number of processor clocks is processor dependent.  Whether an
   image has no clock, has a clock of its own, or shares a clock with
   another image, is processor dependent."

[492:4-5 16.6.7p1(11)] Replace "the <selector>" with "a <selector>",
insert "corresponding" before "associate name", and delete "of that
construct", because an ASSOCIATE construct might have several
associations.

[496:35-37] Replace the list item "the effects of calling
COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT...other than image 1 (13.5)" with:

"o  Whether command line execution is supported, and the interpretation
    of command line execution in different images (13.7.58);"
being careful to put it in subclause number order with respect to
other items in this list. (Discussion of the command line inquiry
procedures is deferred to a later paper.)

[496:38-40] Move the two list items concerning subclause 13.7.67 to
[497:8+], being careful to put them in subclause number order with
respect to the other items moved to the same place.

[496:41-42] Replace "whether" with "if RANDOM_INIT is not invoked,
whether".  Replace "13.5" with "13.7.138" and move the list item to
[497:8+], being careful to put it in subclause number order with respect
to the other items moved to the same place.

[497:1-2] Replace the list item "on images that use a common random
number generator..." with:

  "o  if images use a common random number generator, the sequences of
      values assigned to the HARVEST argument resulting from calls to
      the intrinsic subroutine RANDOM_NUMBER (13.7.138) in unordered
      segments;"

Then move it to [497:8+], being careful to put it in subclause number
order with respect to the other items moved to the same place.

[497:3-4] Replace the list item "whether the results returned from
CPU TIME..." with:

    o Whether a clock or processor time is available on all images
      and whether all images share the same clock, processor time or
      time zone, for calls to the intrinsic subroutines CPU_TIME
      (13.7.43), DATE_AND_TIME (13.7.46) and SYSTEM_CLOCK (13.7.167);
