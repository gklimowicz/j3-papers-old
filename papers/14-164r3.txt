Subject: Interp concerning LOCK_TYPE and unlimited polymorphism

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F08/0109
TITLE: LOCK_TYPE and unlimited polymorphic
KEYWORD: LOCK_TYPE, unlimited polymorphic
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Assume type LOCK_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_Fortran_Env is
available.

Q1. Is allocation of X%C permitted?

  TYPE t
    TYPE(LOCK_TYPE),ALLOCATABLE :: c
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t) :: x[*],y[*]
  ALLOCATE(y%c)
  ALLOCATE(x%c,SOURCE=y%c)

Q2. Is allocation of C permitted?

  class(*), pointer :: C
  type(lock_type), intent(in) :: L[*]

  allocate ( C, source=L )

Q3. Is allocation of C permitted?

  class(*), pointer :: C

  allocate ( LOCK_TYPE :: C )

Q4. Is pointer assignment to C permitted?

  class(*), pointer :: C
  type(lock_type), intent(in), target :: L[*]

  c => L

Q5. Is this ALLOCATE statement conforming?

  CLASS(*),ALLOCATABLE :: C[:]
  TYPE(LOCK_TYPE) :: X
  ALLOCATE(C,MOLD=X)

ANSWER:

A1. Allocation of X%C is not intended to be allowed.  An edit is
    supplied to correct the requirements on allocation of LOCK_TYPE.

A2. Allocation of C is not intended to be allowed.  An edit is
    supplied to correct the requirements on allocation of LOCK_TYPE.

A3. This allocation of C is permitted.

A4. Pointer assignment to C is permitted.

A5. This statement was intended to be permitted.  An edit is supplied
    to correct the requirements.

EDITS:

[6:7+] After definition 1.3.33.2 parent component, insert new term
  "1.3.33.2a
   potential subobject component
   nonpointer component, or potential subobject component of a
   nonpointer component (4.5.1)".

[127:8-9] 6.7.1.1 Syntax, C643,
          Change "C_PTR," to "C_PTR or"
          Delete ", LOCK_TYPE ... LOCK_TYPE".

[127:9+] Insert new constraint
  "C643a (R627) If SOURCE= appears, the declared type of <source-expr>
         shall not be LOCK_TYPE or have a potential subobject
         component of type LOCK_TYPE."

[127:18-19] 6.7.1.1, p4,
  "If" -> "If an ALLOCATE statement has a SOURCE= specifier and an",
{There is no problem with MOLD=.  "subcomponent" works ok here because
 we have an object not a type.}
