Subject:      Interpretation Request:  Free source form requirement for
                                       blank in PRINT statement

NUMBER:       2
TITLE:        Free source form requirement for blank in PRINT statement
KEYWORDS:     free source form, PRINT, blank
DEFECT TYPE:  Interpretation
STATUS:       X3J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following PRINT statement form:    PRINT"(I5)",5

Section 3.3.1 of the Fortran 95 standard states:

  A blank shall be used to separate names, constants, or labels from adjacent
  keywords, names, constants, or labels.

  NOTE 3.3
  For example, the blank[s] after ... READ ... [is] required in the
  following:

  ...
  READ 10
  ...

Although the sentence preceding R420 is somewhat confusing in that it uses
the phrase "a sequence of characters, DELIMITED by either apostrophes or
quotation marks", the syntax rule itself is clear that the " or ' delimiting
characters are part of the <char-literal-constant> syntax.  The first sentence
on the top of page 36 then clarifies that although the delimiter characters
are a part of the syntax, they are not a part of the value.

Section 3.2 makes it clear that a character literal constant is a token.
Section 3.2.5 describes delimiters but does not include either " or ' because
it is describing delimiters for lists.

Thus, it seems clear that in free source form a blank is required between
the keyword PRINT and the character literal constant containing the format
list but there is also some disagreement on this point among existing Fortran
processors.

(1) In free source form, is a blank required between the keyword PRINT and
    the character literal constant containing the format specification?

(2) Also, for clarification, in free source form, is a blank required between
    the keyword PRINT and the asterisk that represents the unformatted output
    specifier?

The subject line pretty much says it all.  Is a blank needed between the
keyword PRINT and the format string "(i5)" in free form source?  I've tried it
on several compilers and only one of them objects.  I think it's right, a
blank is required.

Section 3.3.1 says
  "A blank must be used to separate names, constants, or labels from adjacent
  keywords, names, constants, or labels.  For example, in
  ...
  READ 10
  ...
  the blank [is] required"

I think R420 is clear that the " or ' are part of the char-literal-constant.
The sentence preceding R420 is confusing because it talks about "a sequence of
characters, DELIMITED by either apostrophes or quotation marks".  But that's
probably just loose wording.

Sectionb 3.2 makes it clear that a character literal constant is a token and
3.2.6 does not include either " or ' as a delimiter.

I suppose we could ask the same question about print* and I think the answer
is the same.  A blank is required.

I agree with your analysis - no other citations to add, just expressing
agreement.

No, an asterisk is not a keyword, name, constant or label.
Lexically, it is an operator (3.2,3.2.3).

Similarly, although "print3,x" and "printstring,x" are lexically bad,
"print.myop.3,x" and "print+string,x" are lexically ok - in particular they
are not affected by 3.3.1.

[ From a coworker here at SGI/CRI ]

I believe Malcolm Cohen's argument that * is exempt because it is an
"operator" is quite weak.  The * symbol is used, depending on context,
as an operator, statement label, character length specifier, array
bounds specifier, default I/O unit number, etc.  Claiming that the *
symbol is an operator in the context of "print *,..."  seems incorrect.

Given that the standard already notes that a blank is required in "read 10",
it seems hard to argue that one is not required after the PRINT keyword.

However, given traditonal usage, I would think it very unlikely that any
vendor would actually enforce this rule.  It seems only relevant for the
flagging requirement.
