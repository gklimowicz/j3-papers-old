Subject: MOVE_ALLOC wording clarification

Discussion
----------

The description of MOVE_ALLOC could be better worded.

Para 6 (STAT present and no error) and the first sentence of para 7
(Error with no STAT) should be interchanged because the remainder of
para 7 is for the STAT present case.

Para 7 should say that if STAT is present an error condition occurs,
it is assigned a positive value.

Para 7 should clarify that the issues with stopped and failed images
only apply if the arguments are coarrays.

Para 7 sentence 3 does not need the "no stopped image" since that is
covered by the previous sentence and this sentence begins
"Otherwise...".

With the edits proposed, para 6 and 7 of the MOVE_ALLOC description
become:

  If an error condition occurs and STAT is absent, error termination
  is initiated.

  If STAT is present and execution is successful, it is assigned the
  value zero. If STAT is present and an error condition occurs, it is
  assigned a positive value. If the FROM argument is a coarray and the
  current team contains a stopped image, STAT is assigned the value
  STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.
  Otherwise, if the current team contains a failed image and no other
  error condition occurs, STAT is assigned the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE
  from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. Otherwise, STAT is
  assigned a processor-dependent positive value that differs from that
  of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.
