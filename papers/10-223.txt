DISCUSSION

Requirement 2 of N1820 is

   If it is reasonably feasible, a mechanism should be provided for
   C function to specify by explicit declaration the type or rank
   (both preferred) of an assumed-shape, allocatable, or pointer
   object. The objective is to provide a facility for type and rank
   safety.

This can be done by adding an extra function.  The edits assume
that the typedefs introduced in 10-203r1 are available.

EDITS to 10-165r2:

[11:3] Change "Eight" to "Six".

[11:9] Change the line to
"If an error occurs during execution of the function that returns an
int value, the returned value is".

[12:13+] Add new section:

5.2.6.3a int CFI_descriptor ( CFI_cdesc_t *, const CFI_type_t type,
             const CFI_rank_t rank, const CFI_attribute_t attribute );

<<Description.>> CFI_descriptor specifies the value of a C descriptor.
The type of the object is specified by type; its value shall be
that of one of the macros of Table 5.2. The rank is specified by
rank; its value shall be in the range 0<=rank<=15. The object
is assumed-shape, allocatable, or a pointer according to the value of
attribute; this shall be that of one of the macros of Table 5.1.
The base address of the object shall be NULL.
