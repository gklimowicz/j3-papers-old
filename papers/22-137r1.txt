NUMBER: F18/038
TITLE:  SIZE= with no reason
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Fortran 2018 permits SIZE= in an input statement without ADVANCE=.
SIZE= assigns to its variable the number of character transferred by
edit descriptors.

This means that SIZE= is also allowed for list-directed and namelist
input/output, but no edit descriptor is involved, so this will always
assign the value zero to the variable.

For example,
    READ(*,*,SIZE=N) X
    PRINT *,N ! Always prints zero.

Was this superfluous additional way of assigning zero to an integer
variable deliberately added?

ANSWER:

No, this was not a deliberate addition.
An edit is provided to remove this inadvertent feature.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[225:29+] 12.6.2.1 Syntax, in 12.6.2 Control information list,
    After constraint C1213 that begins
        "(R1213) A BLANK=, PAD=, END=, EOR=, or SIZE= specifier..."
    insert new constraint
        "C1213a A SIZE= specifier shall not appear in a list-directed
                or namelist input statement."
