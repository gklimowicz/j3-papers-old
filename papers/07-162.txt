We sometimes refer to ultimate or direct components of types, but we
define these terms by reference to objects.

[57:8-10] [Editor: Replace "an object of" by "a".  Delete "of the
object".]

[57:11-13] [Editor: Replace "an object of" by "a".  Delete "of the
object".]

[57:13+] [Editor: Insert a new paragraph:]

"The components of an object of derived type are the components of its
type."

[63:26] [Editor: Append ", and shall not have a direct component of that
type."]

[91:6] [Editor: Append ", and shall not be of a type that has a direct
component of that type."]

[91:9] [Editor: Insert "a module variable," before "a dummy argument", or
insert ", "declared in the specification part of a module" after "main
program", because module variables now effectively have the SAVE
attribute.]
