Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~

Fortran 2018 makes RECURSIVE the default for regular functions; it
seems to be intended that the restriction that a RECURSIVE function
cannot be ELEMENTAL was removed (C1245 in 10-007r1). However, this
feature addition is not mentioned in the introduction.

Edit to N2146
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On page xix, in the bullet headed "Program units and procedures:",
before "can be invoked recursively"
insert ", including ELEMENTAL procedures,"
making the whole sentence read
"Procedures \obs{that are not declared with an asterisk type-param-value},
 including ELEMENTAL procedures, can be invoked recursively by default;
 the RECURSIVE keyword is advisory only."
