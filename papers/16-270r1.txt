1. Introduction
---------------

The IMPORT statement is described in 15.4.3.4, in connection with
interface bodies.  It was introduced to remedy a defect concerning
interface bodies to which I objected during the development of Fortran
90 -- the default should have been host association.

Now that the IMPORT statement is allowed in a BLOCK construct, and
observing that it primarily affects host association, three out of four
of its illustrative NOTES do not deal with interface bodies, and it is a
specification, it ought to be in clause 8, between subclause 8.7
"IMPLICIT statement" and 8.8 "NAMELIST statement."

If anybody feels like tackling it, a NOTE illustrating its use in a
BLOCK construct wouldn't be harmful.

2. Edits
--------

[304:8 - 306:1- 15.4.3.4] Move the entire subclause to [123:1-] between
subclause 8.7 "IMPLICIT statement" and 8.8 "NAMELIST statement."
