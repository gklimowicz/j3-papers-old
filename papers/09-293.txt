Subject: HYPOT
From: Van Snyder
Date: 2009 October 19

1. Introduction
---------------

HYPOT was introduced during the effort to provide access to all of
libm, with the same spelling for each function.

We changed some of the names, and some of the functionalities, and added
at least one function, so we didn't stick to the original goal, for
which very little reason was given anyway (other than Keeping Up with
the Joneses).

HYPOT is trivially redundant to CABS and NORM2.

CABS requires the result to be computed without undue overflow or
underflow, and the same behavior is recommended for NORM2, so
potential users who might have been hoping for that functionality in
HYPOT can get it from CABS or NORM2.

There are very few intrinsic functions as trivial as HYPOT, and none
as trivial have been introduced for a long time -- certainly not in
2008.

2. Proposal
-----------

HYPOT is unnecessary clutter.  Delete HYPOT.
