Subject: The term 'variable' and ASSOCIATE

NUMBER: TBD
TITLE: The term 'variable' and ASSOCIATE
KEYWORD: ASSOCIATE, variable
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following program conforming?

PROGRAM Main
    INTEGER :: coarray[*]
    coarray = 10*THIS_IMAGE()
    ASSOCIATE (alias => coarray[1])
        IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 2) PRINT *, alias
    END ASSOCIATE
END PROGRAM Main


DISCUSSION:

1.3.154 says "variable: data entity that can be defined and redefined
during execution of a program".  However, the term 'variable' is also
used with a syntactic meaning when italicised; R602 says "<variable> is
<designator> or <expr>".

8.1.3.1 R805, C801, C803 and C804 use 'variable' in the latter sense,
though C804 uses it in its Roman form (which seems to be a mistake).
C803 and C804 can be read together to mean either of the following:

    a) The designator 'coarray[1]' is a variable and therefore the
program is not conforming, or

    b) The designator 'coarray[1]' cannot be a variable, therefore must
be an expression, so the program is conforming.

C804 probably meant to use the term designator, anyway, so should
read:

    "C804 (R805) <expr> shall not be a <designator>."

However, that does not resolve the above ambiguity.  It needs to be
clear exactly when the selector will be treated as an expression and
when as a variable.

There are two other questions that arise, but which are not part
of this interpretation request:

    1) I am also a little puzzled why C803 exists at all, because I
cannot see what problem it is trying to resolve.  As far as I can see,
it would be enough to specify that the property carries over in 8.1.3.3,
as is done for the property of being permitted in a variable definition
context.

    2) On the wider issue, I cannot search the PDF for all occurrences
of the italicised form, and the word 'variable' is too common to search
for all uses, so I do not know whether this problem also occurs in other
constructs.

Awaiting statement of direction.
