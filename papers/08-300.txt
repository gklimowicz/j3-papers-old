NOTE: This paper contains changes to the edits in 08-256r2.


Edits to edits from 08-256r2:
-----------------------------

[116] In "6.2.2 Lock variables", replace the edit that reads:

"A lock variable shall not appear as:"

with:

"A lock variable shall not appear in a variable definition context
except as the <lock-variable> in a LOCK or UNLOCK statement."

and delete

"(1) the variable of an <assignment-stmt>,

(2) an actual argument in a reference to a procedure if the associated
dummy argument has the INTENT(OUT) attribute,

(3) the <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement in which SOURCE=
appears, or

(4) the selector in a SELECT TYPE or ASSOCIATE construct if the
associate name of that construct appears in one of the above contexts."

------

[191] In Note 8.39b, at the end of the first sentence, replace
"varaible" with "variable".
