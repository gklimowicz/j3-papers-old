NUMBER: F08/0110
TITLE: Interdependence of specifier values in input/output statements
KEYWORD: specifier, input/output statement
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTIONS:

1. Are the following INQUIRE statements permitted?

    LOGICAL :: Exist, Opened
    INQUIRE ( FILE='fred', EXIST=exist )
    INQUIRE ( UNIT=42, OPENED=opened )

2. Is the following INQUIRE statement permitted?

    INTEGER :: U
    INTERFACE
      FUNCTION P ( A )
        INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: A
        INTEGER, POINTER :: P
      END FUNCTION P
    END INTERFACE
    INQUIRE ( FILE='fred', NUMBER=u, POSITION=p(u) )

3. Is the following READ statement permitted?

    INTEGER :: STATS(42)
    NAMELIST /IN/ V
    READ ( *, IN, IOSTAT=STATS(V) )

ANSWERS:

1. According to 9.12p5 [243:3-5]

  "The value of a specifier in an input/output statement shall not
  depend on the definition or evaluation of any other specifier in the
  <io-control-spec-list> or <inquire-spec-list> in that statement."

the INQUIRE statements are prohibited because the values of the
variables EXIST and OPEN depend upon the values of the FILE= and UNIT=
specifiers, respectively.  They were intended to be permitted.  Edits
are provided to correct this mistake.

2. According to 9.12p6 [243:6-8]

  "The value of any subscript or substring bound of a variable that
  appears in a specifier in an input/output statement shall not depend
  on any <input-item>, <io-implied-do> <do-variable>, or on the
  definition or evaluation of any other specifier in the
  <io-control-spec> or <inquire-spec> in that statement."

the INQUIRE statement is not prohibited because U is not a subscript
or substring bound.

According to 7.1.4p2 [139:3-4]

  "The evaluation of a function reference shall neither affect nor be
   affected by the evaluation of any other entity within the
   statement."

the INQUIRE statement is not prohibited because, although U is
assigned a value, it is not evaluated.

The INQUIRE statement was intended to be prohibited.  Edits are
provided to correct this mistake.

3. According to 9.12p6 [243:6-8]

  "The value of any subscript or substring bound of a variable that
  appears in a specifier in an input/output statement shall not depend
  on any <input-item>, <io-implied-do> <do-variable>, or on the
  definition or evaluation of any other specifier in the
  <io-control-spec> or <inquire-spec> in that statement."

and 9.12p7 [243:9-11]

  "In a data transfer statement, the variable specified in an IOSTAT=,
  IOMSG=, or SIZE= specifier, if any, shall not be associated with any
  entity in the ... <namelist-group-object-list>...."

and 9.12p8 [243:12-14]

  "In a data transfer statement, if a variable specified in an
  IOSTAT=, IOMSG=, or SIZE= specifier is an array element reference,
  its subscript values shall not be affected by the data transfer, the
  <io-implied-do> processing, or the definition or evaluation of any
  other specifier in the <io-control-spec-list>."

the READ statement is not prohibited because V does not "depend on any
<input-item>, <io-implied-do> <do-variable>, or on the definition or
evaluation of any other specifier in the <io-control-spec> or
<inquire-spec> in that statement."   Although V is input from
namelist, it is not "the variable specified in an IOSTAT=, IOMSG=, or
SIZE= specifier."  The READ statement was intended to be prohibited.
Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[243:3-5 9.12p5] Within the second sentence, provided by Corrigendum
2, replace "values of any <input-item> or" with "value of any".
Append ", or be affected by data transfer caused by that statement".
That sentence becomes

  "The value of an <internal-file-variable> or of a FMT=, ID=, IOMSG=,
   IOSTAT=, or SIZE= specifier shall not depend on the value of any
   <io-implied-do> <do-variable> in the same statement, or be affected
   by data transfer caused by that statement."

{Using "data transfer" instead of "<input-item>" covers the namelist
case.}

[243:6-7 9.12p6] Replace "value of any subscript or substring bound"
with "denotation".  Replace "depend ... <do-variable>" with "be
affected by the data transfer, the <io-implied-do> processing".  The
paragraph becomes

  "The denotation of a variable that appears in a specifier in an
   input/output statement shall not be affected by the data transfer,
   the <io-implied-do> processing, or the definition or evaluation of
   any other specifier in the <io-control-spec-list> or
   <inquire-spec-list> in that statement."

After the paragraph, insert a note:

  NOTE 9.nn
  The semantics of how a variable is denoted is its "denotation";
  this includes such things as component and array element selection.
  Anything that affects this process is prohibited in this context;
  that includes the values of any subscripts used, and if the
  variable is specified by a pointer function reference, anything
  that affects the evaluation of that function.

{Using "data transfer" instead of "<input-item>" covers the namelist
case.}

[243:9 9.12p7] "Insert "ID=," before "IOSTAT".

{Not mentioned in a question, but was a problem.}

[243:12-14 9.12p8] Repairing the paragraph would make it equivalent
(if not identical) to 9.12p6, as revised above.  Therefore, delete
the paragraph.
