Subject: Another processor dependency
Date: 2008 April 14

[128: 6.6.3.2p5] -------------------------------------------------------

Replace the paragraph, to get "processor dependent order" into it:

"If any functions whose results are either allocatable, or structures
with allocatable subobjects, are referenced in the specification part of
a scoping unit or BLOCK construct, and the function references are
executed, allocatable results, and any subobjects that are allocated
allocatable entities in the results returned by the functions, are
deallocated in a processor-dependent order before execution of the
executable constructs of the scoping unit or block.

[459: A.2] -------------------------------------------------------------

Editor: Insert a new item after (5.3.7) -- second from the bottom:

"o the order of deallocation of allocatable results, or allocatable
   subobjects of results, of functions executed in specification parts
   (6.6.3.2);"
