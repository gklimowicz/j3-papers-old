Subject:    IMPORT statement description is misplaced

1. Introduction
---------------

The IMPORT statement is described in 15.4.3.4, in connection with
interface bodies.  It was introduced to remedy a defect concerning
interface bodies to which I objected during the development of Fortran
90 -- the default should have been host association.

Now that the IMPORT statement is allowed in a BLOCK construct, and
observing that it primarily affects host association, and three out of
four of its illustrative NOTES do not deal with interface bodies, it
ought to be in subclause 19.5.1, either within or immediately after
19.5.1.4.

If anybody feels like tackling it, a NOTE illustrating its use in a
BLOCK construct wouldn't be harmful.

2. Edits
--------

[304:8 - 306:1- 15.4.3.4] Move the entire subclause other than NOTE 15.8
on page 306 to [518:1-], either putting it within subclause 19.5.1.4
(without a subclause heading, or with a subsubclause heading after
creating a subsubclause for the content of 19.5.1.4), or immediately
after subclause 19.5.1.4, at the same refinement level, becoming
subclause 19.5.1.5.  Move NOTE 15.8 to [304:1- NOTE 15.4+].
