1. Edits
========

[32:25-26 2.2.1p2] Modules can contain private entities.  Replace "are
to" with "can".

[32:38 2.2.3p1] A processor is not required to invoke a function if it
can determine the value of an expression without it.  This implies that
it can invoke the function, and then not use the result.  Insert a comma
before "which" and replace "is then" with "can then be".

[33:5 2.2.4p1] Modules can contain private entities.  Replace "are
to" with "can".

[34:19 2.3.4p1] Insert "from" after "range".

[35:7+8-9 NOTE 2.5] Remove the sentenct "A program ... portable" because
it's not true.

[35:9 2.3.5p1] Replace "instances of the program" with "images" because
"instances of the program" is not a defined term.

[36:4 2.3.7p4] Delete "the" before "execution".

[36:16-18 2.3.7p2] Replace "a companion processor" by "means other than
Fortran" twice because processors don't define procedures.

[36:17 2.3.7p2] Delete "(ISO/IEC 9899:2011)" because this precludes
procedures defined by means other than Fortran or C, which is explicitly
allowed by 2.5.7p2.

[37:20 2.4.3.1p2] Delete "the" before "execution".

[37:33+2 2.4.3.2p5 last bullet] Delete "scalar" because substring
selection might produce an array.

[37:33 2.4.7p6] Insert "(6.6)" after "coindexed object" and after "image
index"

[41:3 2.5.1p1] Insert "structure component," before "named constant".

[41:19 2.5.4p1] Replace "Association" with "Name association ("16.5.1)".

[41:20+ 2.5.4p1+] Insert a paragraph:

"Pointer association (16.5.2) between a pointer and a target allows the
target to be referenced by a reference to the pointer."

[41:21 2.5.4p2] Replace "Also, storage association" with "Storage
association (16.5.3)".

[41:21+ 2.5.4p2+] Insert a paragraph:

"Inheritance association (16.5.4)" occurs between components of the
parent component and components inherited by type extension."

[42:3+2 NOTE 2.14] Replace "A" with "Other than the requirement in 2.3.7
that a program unit that is defined by means other than Fortran and that
initiates normal termination is required to include the effect of
executing the C \cf{exit()} function, a"

2. Question without edits
=========================

[39:12-13 2.4.6p1] Does "The rank of an array, once declared, is
constant" conflict with the SELECT RANK construct and assumed rank
variables?
