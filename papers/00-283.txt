This paper is a revision of 00-217, which was written, but not
reviewed or acted on at the previous meeting.

Unresolved issue 257 points out that the discussion of
interoperation with C functions is confusing.  This paper
attempts to clarify the issue.

One source of confusion is that the current draft is a lack of clear
distinction between abstract and concrete situations.  There is
material defining when a C function and a Fortran procedure are
interoperable, but this material is abstract in that a given program
would not actually have both the Fortran procedure and the C function
in question.  This gets particularly confusing when syntactic
conditions (like "is declared with") are put on things that don't
actually exist.  I find it easier to follow if this material is
phrased in terms of comparing Fortran procedure interfaces with C
function prototypes.  This material is much like the comparison of
Fortran and C types in its level of abstraction.

  [392:19,25] "C function" -> "C function prototype".

  [392:31,34,36,38] "C function" -> "prototype".  

  [392:19,25] "procedure" -> "procedure interface" (twice)

  [392:26] "procedure is declared with" -> "interface has"

  [392:27-29] replace item (2) with

     "(2) either

         (a) the interface describes a function whose result
             variable is interoperable with the result of the
             prototype or

         (b) the interface describes a subroutine, and the
             prototype has a result type compatible with the C
             type void;"

  [392:30] "Fortran procedure" -> "interface"

  [393:11] "function with an" -> "procedure"

  [393:19] Replace the whole line with
           "is interoperable with the C function prototype"

  [392:22] Move this line into a new note at [392:37+].
           Then change "reference" to "referenced" both here and
           on [392:37].  (per check of the C standard).

  [392:19-21] Move this para to [392:342+]

  [394:1-] Add the following note at the end of 16.2.6

    "Note 16.xx

     The interopability of Fortran procedure interfaces with C
     function prototypes is only one part of invocation of a C
     function from Fortran.  There are four pieces to consider in such
     an invocation: the procedure reference, the Fortran procedure
     interface, the C function prototype, and the C function.  
     Conversely, invocation of a Fortran procedure from C involves
     the function reference, the C function prototype, the Fortran
     procedure interface, and the Fortran procedure.  In
     order to determine whether a reference is allowed, it is
     necessary to consider all four pieces.

     For example, consider a C function that can be described by
     the C function prototype

       [copy line from [388:10]]

     Such function may be invoked from Fortran as follows:

       [copy [388:12-24]]

     The procedure reference has character string actual arguments.
     These correspond to character array dummy arguments in the
     procedure interface body as allowed by Fortran's rules of
     sequence association (12.4.1.5).  Those array dummy arguments in
     the procedure interface are interoperable with the formal
     parameters of the C function prototype.  The C function is not
     shown here, but is assumed to be compatible with the C function
     prototype."

  [388:9-24] Replace these lines (after copying most of their content
     as instructed above" with

     "Note 16.xx has an example of interoperation bewtween Fortran
      and C strings."
