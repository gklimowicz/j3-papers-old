[134:32 6.7.3.2p3] Replace "any" with "every".

[206:13,22 9.3.3.4p3,4] Replace "When" with "While" twice, because this
doesn't occur when the file is connected, i.e., during execution of the
OPEN statement.

[217:8 9.6.2.5p5] says "... the set of storage units specified by the
item list or NML= specifier, plus the storage units specified by the
SIZE= specifier, is defined to be the pending input/output storage
sequence...."

Using "plus" makes it sound like there's an arithmetic operation taking
place between them.  Replace "plus" with "and" or "in addition to" or
...?  Maybe reword the paragraph:

  "When an asynchronous input/output statement is executed, a pending
  input/output storage sequence is defined for the data transfer
  operation, consisting of the set of storage units specified by the
  item list or NML= specifier, and the storage units specified by a
  SIZE= specifier if it appears."

[227:5-6 9.6.4.4p2] 9.6.4.4p2 prohibits a format specification to be in
or associated with an internal file in an output statement.  9.12p3 has
a blanket prohibition against any established format specification being
modified in any way by an input/output statement.  9.6.4.4p2 could be
deleted.

[248:21 9.12p2] An asynchronous input/output statement that is executed
while another asynchronous input/output statement is being executed is
not a recursive input/output statement.  Replace "while another
input/output statement is being executed" with "as a result of another
input/output statement being executed".

[270:1+] Subclause 10.10.3 has subsubclauses that begin after initial
text.  Do ISO rules require an initial subsubclause?
