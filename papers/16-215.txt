Discussion:
-----------

In 2.4.8 Established coarrays, paragraph 1 indicates which coarrays
are established in the initial team.

  A nonallocatable coarray that is not a dummy argument or host
  associated with a dummy argument, and not a local variable of a
  subprogram or BLOCK construct, is established in the initial team.

But coarrays with the SAVE attribute are also established in the
initial team. This case seems to have been omitted from the paragraphs
in 2.4.8, or is at least not clearly stated.


Edit to J3/16-007r1:
--------------------

[40:3] In 2.4.8 Established coarray, at the end of para 1, add a new
sentence: "A nonallocatable coarray with the SAVE attribute is
established in the initial team."
