Subject: Pointer-object fixes

The bnf for pointer assignment statements now uses the
bnf terms <data-pointer-object> and <proc-pointer-object>
instead of <pointer-object>.  This change was not properly
reflected in several places.

  [74:4],[81:9],[423:34] Delete "<pointer-assignment-stmt> or"
  [74:4+],[81:9+],[423:34+] Insert new item
     "(x.5) A <data-pointer-object> or <proc-pointer-object> in
            a <pointer-assignment-stmt>,"

  [304:25] "<pointer-object>" ->
           "<data-pointer-object> or <proc-pointer-object>"

Unrelated wording fix for correctness and for consistency
with [403:2].

  [403:30] Add "of a procedure" after "binding label".
