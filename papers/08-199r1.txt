Subject:  Comment: to disallow finalizations on coindexed objects

Discussion:

It seems the 2008 standard requires finalizations of coindexed objects
on two occasions when: 1. a coindexed object as <variable> in an
intrinsic assignment; 2. a coindexed object as an actual argument
associated with an INTENT(OUT) dummy argument.  The semantics of the
two situations are not well defined.  Therefore it's desirable to
disallow finalizations to happen to coindexed objects.


EDITS to 08-007r2 (WG5 N1723):

[74:p8] In 4.5.6.3 "When finalization occurs" paragraph 8

Insert  ", noncoindexed " before "object".


[74:p9] In 4.5.6.3  "When finalization occurs" paragraph 9

Insert before comma (,)
      " and the variable is not a coindexed object"

[74:4.5.6.4p1+] In 4.5.6.4  "Entities that are not finalized"

Insert a new paragraph after paragraph 1 and before NOTE 4.50

      "Coindexed objects are not finalized."
