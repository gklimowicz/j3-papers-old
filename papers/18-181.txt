Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, the GB comment 26
states:

(Referencing page 266, in 13.3.1 Syntax, constraint C1302)

The list of edit descriptors for which an optional comma may be omitted
after a P edit descriptor which is shown in 13.3.1 is not consistent
with the list in 13.8.5. This appears to be an oversight.

and proposes the suggested edit:

In constraint C1302, after "ES," add "EX,".

Discussion
----------

We agree.


Edit to N2146
-------------

In subclause 13.3 Form of a format item list,
the sub-subclause 13.3.1 Syntax

The first bullet of C1302 now reads:

"between a P edit descriptor and an immediately following
F, E, EN, ES, D, or G edit descriptor (13.8.5),
possibly preceded by a repeat specification,"

after "ES," add "EX,"

so the new constraint will read:

"between a P edit descriptor and an immediately following
F, E, EN, ES, EX, D, or G edit descriptor (13.8.5),
possibly preceded by a repeat specification,"

{add the missing EX to the list}
