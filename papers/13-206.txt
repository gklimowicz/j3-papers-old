Title: Access specification in more places

Submitted by: Van Snyder

Status: For consideration

Basic functionality: Allow an access specification in more places:
A procedure statement in an interface block, an enumerator statement,
and a subprogram header.

Rationale: Reduces the number of statements, and thereby long-term cost.

Estimated impact: Minor

Markham M6 conformance: Remove simple deficiency, inconsistency and
discrepancy.

Detailed specification: Allow an access specification in more places:
A procedure statement in an interface block, an enumerator statement,
and a subprogram header.

Draft edits: To estimate scope of project

Replace R460 with

R460 <enumerator-def-stmt> <<is>> ENUMERATOR [ [ , <access-spec> ] :: ]
                                  <enumerator-list>

Insert a paragraph after 4.6p3:

If <access-spec> appears, it specifies the accessibility (5.3.2) of each
<enumerator> in <enumerator-list>.

Replace R1206 with

R1206 <procedure-stmt> <<is>> [ MODULE ] PROCEDURE
                              [ [ , <access-spec> ] :: ]
                              <procedure-name-list>

Insert a paragraph after 12.4.3.2p7:

If <access-spec> appears, it specifies the accessibility (5.3.2) of each
<procedure-name> in <procedure-name-list>.

Insert an alternative for R1226

R1226 <prefix-spec> <<is>> <access-spec>
                    <<or>> <declaration-type-spec>
                    <<or>> ...

Insert a paragraph after 12.6.2.1p5:

If <prefix-spec> <access-spec> appears, it specifies the accessibility
(5.3.2) of the <function-name> in the <function-stmt> or the
<subroutine-name> in the <subroutine-stmt>.
