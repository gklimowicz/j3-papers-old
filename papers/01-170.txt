Subject: Unneeded TYPEALIAS constraint
References: 98-240r1, 99-102

At meeting 155, the DATA subgroup asked about the third constraint
of section 4.6 prohibiting deferred or assumed size parameters in
the declaration-type-spec of a type alias statement.  It was unclear
where that constraint came from, as it was not in the original
spec and syntax document for type alias.

Since that meeting, further investigation shows that the constraint
was inserted by the editor when processing the TYPEALIAS edits
introduced by paper J3 98-240r1.  The editors paper J3 99-102 states

      I added a constraint that the type-spec not have any deferred or
      assumed type parameters.  Perhaps this is or could be covered
      elsewhere, but we surely need it somewhere.

At the time, no one complained about the addition of this constraint.
However, upon reconsidering this, both /data and /interop believe
the constraint is unnecessary.  The following edit removes the
constraint.
