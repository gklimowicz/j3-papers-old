A. Introduction
---------------

In some ways "generic function" or "generic intrinsic procedure"
is a misnomer because there is arguably no actual function, just
a coordinated collection of specific functions sharing a
generic name.

It may be better always to speak in terms of
"generic names" instead of "generic procedures", which is
usually what is meant.

There is a bewildering variety of ways to combine
generic+binding+function+name+reference in the standard
so any reduction in the number of distinct technical concepts
that readers must comprehend is a priori a good thing.
That a "generic function", whatever is meant, cannot in general
be coded as a Fortran function is a subtle point which makes
many sentences in the standard harder to interpret.

Edits are supplied to eliminate references to
	generic function
	generic subroutine (I didn't find any)
	generic procedure
	generic intrinsic function (none without also "name")
	generic intrinsic subroutine (I didn't find any)
	generic intrinsic procedure
in favor of
	generic binding
	generic binding reference
	generic function name
	generic function reference
	generic function-reference
	generic subroutine name
	generic subroutine reference
	generic procedure name
	generic identifier
	generic intrinsic function name
	generic intrinsic subroutine name
	generic intrinsic procedure name
	generic name
	generic name of an intrinsic function
	generic name of an intrinsic subroutine
	generic name of an intrinsic procedure
	generic name of a function
	generic name of a subroutine
	generic name of a procedure
	generic procedure binding
	generic procedure name
	generic procedure reference
	generic reference
	generic type-bound procedure name
