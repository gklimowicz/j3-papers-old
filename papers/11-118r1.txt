DISCUSSION

Unresolved Technical Issue TR11 points out that NOTE 1.1 should be
expanded to included assumed-length character objects.

An edit is supplied to do this.

EDIT to N1838:

[1:24+] In 1.3.3 C descriptor, replace NOTE 1.1 with


"NOTE 1.1
 A C descriptor is used to describe an object that is allocatable,
 assumed-length character, assumed-rank, assumed-shape, or a pointer."
