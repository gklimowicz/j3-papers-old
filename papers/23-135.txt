1. Introduction

These are the responses to the comments about NOTEs.


2. Edits to N2209

**-056 Single notes in a subclause shall not be numbered

[throughout] Use "singularnote" environment instead of "note"
             environment. Add checking to the macros so that an
             error will occur for more than one singularnote, or
             having both a singularnote and a note, in a subclause.

**-057 NOTEs are not to be indented.

[throughout] Done.

**-058 Background of NOTES must be white not grey.

[throughout] Done.

Also **-058 Use Cambria size 10 in notes.

[throughout] Font size in NOTEs will be size 10,
             except for obsolescent features.

**-059 Single notes in a subclause shall not be numbered

Duplicate of Comment 56 (which was Accepted).
