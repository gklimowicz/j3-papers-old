QUESTION:
    If a program does a nonadvancing WRITE followed by a
    list-directed WRITE, must the list-directed WRITE write to the
    current record or may it start a new record?


ANSWER: The list-directed WRITE is not required to start a new record.

DISCUSSION:

Following the non-advancing output operation, the location for the
start of the next output operation is within the current record.  The
list-directed output operation begins at this location. New records
may be created during processing of the list-directed output
statement.

EDIT: None.
