Subject:   Interpretation request on procedure pointers (not F03/0012 revisited)


NUMBER: F03/0017
TITLE:  Dummy procedure pointers and PRESENT
KEYWORDS: Dummy procedure pointers, PRESENT
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS:
QUESTION:

Does the following program conform to the 2003 standard?

  procedure(real), pointer :: F => null()
  call s ( f )
  contains
    subroutine S ( F )
      procedure(real), optional, pointer :: F
      print *, present(f)
    end subroutine S
  end

ANALYSIS:

The second paragraph of 12.4.1.3 requires that if the dummy argument does
not have the POINTER attribute and the actual argument does, the actual
argument shall be associated.  It is not clear in 13.7.91 whether the
argument of PRESENT has or has not the POINTER attribute.

ANSWER:

The program conforms to the 2003 standard.  An edit is supplied to remove
any possibility of a contradictory reading of the relation between
12.4.1.3 and 13.7.91.

EDITS:

In the second paragraph of 12.4.1.3 [271:16] replace "an associated" by
"a".

At the end of that paragraph, insert a new sentence:

"Except in references to intrinsic inquiry functions, if the actual
argument is a pointer it shall be associated."
