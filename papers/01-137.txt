NUMBER: 000089
TITLE: Rules allowing duplicate names
KEYWORDS: generic, duplicate names
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Under what conditions can a name in class (1) as described in 14.1.2 be
used in more than one declaration?

The second complete paragraph after the list in 14.1.2, immediately
before note 14.2 [276:5-7 in 97-007r2] begins:

``Within a scoping unit, a name that identifies a local entity of one
class shall not be used to identify another local entity of the same
class, except in the case of generic names (12.3.2.1).''

Is the intent here that a generic name may be used only to identify
another generic interface, or that a generic name may be used to identify
any other entity in class (1)?

ANSWER:

The rules are laid out in 12.3.2.1, which is referenced. The
exceptional case is that a procedure is permitted to have the same
specific and generic name. An edit is provided to clarify the text.

EDIT:

Page 276, Subclause 14.1.2, in line 6 of page 276 [276:6], replace 'in
the case of generic names' by 'that a procedure is permitted to have
the same specific and generic name'.
