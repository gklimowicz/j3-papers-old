Subject: Procedure pointers in BLOCK DATA program units

NUMBER: 
TITLE: Procedure pointers in BLOCK DATA program units
KEYWORDS: Procedure pointer, common block, block data
DEFECT TYPE: 
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

It is clear that procedure pointers are permitted in common blocks.
However, due to the restrictions on BLOCK DATA program units, it seems
that such a common block can not appear in a BLOCK DATA program unit.

Was it intended that common blocks containing procedure pointers could
be initialized in a BLOCK DATA program unit?

ANSWER:

Yes, it was intended that common blocks containing procedure pointers
could be initialized in a BLOCK DATA program unit.  Edits are provided
to correct this oversight.

EDITS:
All edits refer to 04-007.
