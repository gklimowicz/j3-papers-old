Title: Reduce restrictions on VALUE

Submitted by: Van Snyder

Status: For consideration

Basic functionality: Allow a dummy argument with the VALUE attribute to
have the VOLATILE attribute.

Rationale: Reduces the number of statements and temporary variables, and
thereby long-term cost.

Estimated impact: Minor

Markham M6 conformance: Remove simple deficiencies, discrepancies, and
pointless restrictions.

Detailed specification:

Allow a dummy argument with the VALUE attribute to have the VOLATILE
attribute.  There is no problem for a dummy argument with the VALUE
attribute to be VOLATILE.  Its volatility commences after it gets its
value.

Draft edits: To estimate scope of project

Within C558, replace "POINTER, or VOLATILE" with "or POINTER".
