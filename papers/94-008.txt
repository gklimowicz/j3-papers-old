      Date:     940210  (10 Feb. 94)
      To:       X3J3
      From:     Editorial Committee (/edit: C.M. North)
      Subject:  Editorial enhancements for future Draft Revisions

      This is the Editorial Committee's list of things which have been and
      are being considered for future Draft Revisions.  Meeting document
      references are included where applicable - otherwise a meeting ref-
      erence is given in the form M-xxx where xxx stands for the X3J3 meet-
      ing number.

      This document may be revised during each meeting.  Items will not be
      deleted.  Annotations of disposition and current subgroup assignment
      will be added.  At this time, standing document 008 is divided into
      five sub-sections:  edits already done to the FRAME version of 007,
      edits proposed for the F95 version of 007, edits being considered
      for F2000, edits under consideration for some future version, and
      proposed edits which are not being considered by the editorial com-
      mittee at this time.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------


         Section 1:  Edits already done to the FRAME version of 007

     1.  Place notes associated with tables in boxes within the tables;
         e.g., see Table 7.1, [74:20-49], and Table 6.1, [65:1-29].
         (M-127)

     2.  On [114:11-13] change vertical ellipsis to horizontal ellipsis.
         (M-127)

     3.  In Section 13.13.17, [200:20], add period at end of section.
         (M-127)

     4.  In Section 10.9.2.1, [154:34], the "w" in the integer edit
         descriptor should be italicized.  (M-127)

     5.  In Annex A, several places, insert an additional reference and a
         right parenthesis; e.g., [256:23], [259:19].  (M-127)

     6.  In Table C.1 [279:10-61], order rows alphabetically.  (M-127)

     7.  In Section C.13.2.4 [299:16] the "N" should not be italicized
         (two occurrences).  (M-127)

     8.  [261:9] Add "in a" to target definition to fix misleading grammar
         introduced by interp 0. (10 Jan 94)

     9.  Italicize "program" in in Annex A glossary entries "constant ex-
         pression"  [255:41] and "procedure" [259:19] to be consistent with
         the rest of the glossary style. (11 Jan 94)

                                                              Meeting 128

          Section 2:  Edits proposed for F95 version of 007

      1.  Each proposed functional change from F90 to F95 must be accomp-
          anied by a rationale suitable for inclusion in an Annex.
          (M-127) (X3J3/93-322r2)

      2.  Globally change "executable program" ---> "program".
          (X3J3/92-194)
      3.  Host association, 12.1.2.2.1, probably doesn't belong in 12 since
          it also applies to type definition.  (M-124)
          Move 12.1.2.2.1 and 12.1.2.2.2 ---> 14.6.1.2.  (M-127)

      4.  Move [158:26-27] ---> 14.6.1.2.  (M-124)

      5.  Automatic cross-referencing for the next document revision.
         (Weaver, M-124)

      6.  Look at interword spacing, especially in titles.  Put at least
          two spaces between sentences everywhere.  (M-127)

      7.  In Section 12.3.2.1 delete the redundant constraint on [167:34].
          (X3J3/92-200)

      8.  In Annex A [255:42] change "CASE" to "SELECT CASE".
          (X3J3/92-218)

      9.  In Section 14.6.2.1 [247:1] change "target" to "target is an
          allocatable array that".  (M-123)

     10.  In the following places, numbers in parentheses () should be
          large, not small: [250:18], [251:20], [252:17].  There may be
          more occurrences.  (M-127)

     11.  Use square brackets for optional arguments in Section 13
          headings.  (M-127)

     12.  Move Annex C to footnotes (with "enormous" editorial latitude).
          (X3J3/93-322r2)

     13.  a.  Gather together the text on actual arguments and dummy argu-
              ments.      Delete the heading "12.4.1 Actual argument list".
              Insert a new heading, [172:10+] "12.4.1 Actual arguments,
              dummy arguments, and argument association".  Move section
              12.5.2.8 Restrictions on dummy arguments not present and
              section 12.5.2.9 Restriction on entities associated with
              dummy arguments to be subsections of the new section 12.4.1.

          b.  Correct the definition of tokens.  Section 3.2 defines tokens
              as having "indivisible interpretations", yet the integer
              constant 1_cat is a a token, even though the name "cat" is
              recognizably a name and is separately described as a kind
              parameter.  (X3J3/93-008r4, X3J3/93-306, X3J3/93-322r2)

          Section 3:  Edits being considered for F2000

      1.  Do a complete re-write of the Fortran Standard.  (M-124)

      2.  Use a more formal/rigorous semantic description technique.
          (M-124, VDM-SL, X3J3/92-190)
      3.  Make a ruling (or rulings) on treating nouns such as "data" as
          either a  plural noun or a singular collective noun.
          (X3J3/93-113)


          Section 4:  Edits being considered for some future version

      1.  Move Chapter 14 into the rest of the Document piecemeal.  (M-124)
          (Requested by Dick Hendrickson)

      2.  Consistently distinguish between an entity and its name (M-123)
          and be more precise in the use of the term "entity".
          (X3J3/93-113)

      3.  Reconsider the syntax and philosophy of examples.  (M-123)

      4.  Remove (or add) redundancy.  (M-124)

      5.  Reorganize and reclassify the intrinsics in Chapter 13.  (M-123)

      6.  Change wording for Result Value, Case (i), for ASSOCIATED.
          (X3J3/92-132)

      7.  Rewrite example in Section 4.5 [38:34].  (M-124) (SD006.19)

      8.  Remove inconsistencies in the use of the terms "attribute",
          "property", and "characteristic".
          (X3J3/92-202r, X3J3/92-248, X3J3/92-307, SD006.76, X3J3/93-112)

      9.  Be consistent in the use of "local name" and "name".  (M-125)

                      Editorial Committee at this time

      1.  MERGE not an array construction intrinsic? (X3J3/92-197)
