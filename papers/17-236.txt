Subject: Comment 26 (reallocating assignment)
Date: 2017 October 17


1. Introduction

Comment 26 notes that reallocating allocatable assignment for polymorphic
variables only specifies reallocation when the types are different, not
when the kind type parameters are different.

Furthermore, no mention is made of what the kind type parameters should be
in the newly allocated value, e.g. for the example
    CLASS(*),ALLOCATABLE :: X
    X = 1.0d0
the standard states that X is allocated to be type real, but does not say
that its kind type parameter should be that of double precision.

These flaws are oversights in the description.  This paper contains edits
to fix them.


2. Edits to 17-007r2 (N2137)

[170:19] 10.2.1.3 Interpretation of intrinsic assignments, p3,
         Before "corresponding length type" delete "of the",
{Grammatical improvement: "of the" sounds like it means at least one.}
         After "polymorphic and the dynamic type"
         insert "or any corresponding kind type parameter values",
         making that sentence read:
  "If the variable is an allocated allocatable variable, it is deallocated
   if expr is an array of different shape, any corresponding length
   type parameter values of the variable and expr differ, or the variable
   is polymorphic and the dynamic type or any corresponding kind type
   parameter values of the variable and expr differ."

[170:21] Same paragraph, 1st bullet in next sentence,
         after "dynamic type" insert "and kind type parameter values",
         making that sentence down to the end of the 1st bullet read:
   "If the variable is or becomes an unallocated allocatable variable, it
    is then allocated with
    - the same dynamic type and kind type parameter values as expr if the
      variable is polymorphic,"
