ISO/IEC 60559, the ISO/IEC floating-point standard, was updated
in May of 2020 to match the content of IEEE Std. 754-2019.

Members of the LAPACK team would like to have support for the
new versions of maximum and minimum added to languages as soon as
possible.  The way exceptional values were handled by max and min
in the previous edition of the standard was determined to be less
desirable than expected.  The new edition of the standard replaced
the old operations with new ones.

The change is a problem for us, because the old versions of max
and min are the basis for the functions IEEE_MAX_NUM,
IEEE_MAX_NUM_MAG, IEEE_MIN_NUM, and IEEE_MIN_NUM_MAG.  The
definitions of those functions reference the text of the previous
edition of the floating-point standard.  That text no longer
exists in the new edition.

In Fortran 2018, a similar issue arose regarding the function
IEEE_NEXT_AFTER.  The function next_after in the original
edition of the floating-point standard was replaced with the pair
of functions next_down and next_up.  Fortran 2018 still defines
IEEE_NEXT_AFTER, but it also supports IEEE_NEXT_DOWN and
IEEE_NEXT_UP.  The definitions of the three functions do not
reference the floating-point standard.

A complicating factor is that some hardware includes hardware
implementations of the old max and min operators.  Sun's SPARC
CPUs had them.  The new operations can be implemented by short
sequences of instructions on existing hardware, but they will
not be as fast as single hardware instructions.

One reason for wanting to update the reference to
ISO/IEC 60559 to the latest edition is that the new edition
fixed a few problems present in the previous edition.  In
particular, the comparison operations in the previous edition
placed requirements on exception handling that could not be
efficiently implemented.  As a result, language implementations
ignored those restrictions.  The new edition relaxes the
restrictions such that efficient code is also conforming code.
