Page 10, NOTE 5.3. Change
"the corresponding formal parameter is the address of a descriptor of
type CFI_cdesc_t (8.7). The rank member of the descriptor provides the
rank of the actual argument."
to
"the corresponding formal parameter is the address of a descriptor of
type CFI_cdesc_t (8.7) for the effective argument. The rank member of
the descriptor provides the rank."
Reason: The C descriptor describes the effective argument, rather than
the actual argument, see top of page 31. Let's also take the opportunity
to say here that it describes the effective argument. Page 31 is a bit
late, though it is mentioned for assumed-type and assumed-rank on page
9.

Page 20, second sentence. Change
"CFI_attribute_other specifies an assumed-shape array, a nonallocatable
nonpointer scalar, an assumed-size array, or an array that is argument
associated with an assumed-size array."
to
"CFI_attribute_other specifies a nonallocatable nonpointer object that
is a scalar, an array of known shape, or an assumed-size array."
Reason: The present sentence is not correct, since the descriptor is
for the effective argument. See also 8.2.

Page 31, penultimate para, line 2, Change "actual" to "effective".
Reason: The C descriptor describes the effective argument, rather than
the actual argument.
