Subject: Additional Edits for M.6: Extend Initialization Expressions

References:	X3J3/96-165, J3/97-157, J3/97-208R1

PROPOSAL:

Permit all elemental intrinsic functions in an initialization expression 
except the math functions ABS(z), ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2, CABS, COS, COSH, 
EXP, LOG, LOG10, SIN, SINH, SQRT, TAN, and TANH. (CABS is a specific intrinsic 
name.)

PROPOSED ADDITIONAL EDITS:

Note: Edits that were approved at Meeting 142 (August 1997) are shown in 
docment J3/97-007R1 (Sep 1997). Page and line references below are to docment 
J3/97-007R1 (Sep 1997).

[96: 17+] Add NOTE 7.xx:
All elemental intrinsic functions are permitted in an initialization 
expression except the following "mathematical functions": ABS (with an 
argument of complex type), ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2, CABS, COS, COSH, EXP, LOG, 
LOG10, SIN, SINH, SQRT, TAN, and TANH.

BACKGROUND:

Edits were approved at Meeting 142 (August 1997). The edits in this paper are 
intended to supply additional informative text.
