We sometimes refer to ultimate or direct components of types, but we
define these terms by reference to objects.

[57:8-10] [Editor: Replace "an object of" by "a".  Delete "of the
object".]

[57:11-13] [Editor: Replace "an object of" by "a".  Replace second
"object" by "type".  Delete "of the object".]

[57:13+] [Editor: Insert a new paragraph:]

"The components of an object of derived type are the components of its
type."

[79:5+: Note 4.64] [The constructor is incorrect because the type has a
procedure pointer component.  Editor: Insert ``SYNOPSIS='' before TEXT in
the constructor for type REFERENCE three lines from the end of the note.
Then at the end of the note add a sentence ``The keyword SYNOPSIS is
required because the fifth component of the type REFERENCE is a procedure
pointer component, not a data pointer component of type character.  It is
not necessary to specify a <proc-target> for the procedure pointer
component because it has default initialization.'']
