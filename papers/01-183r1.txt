Issue 245 (page 361)

This issue notes that we need to indicate that an entity of type C_PTR
becomes undefined when an object which it is associated with reaches
the end of its lifetime.

Edit: [361:35-39] replace J3 internal note with

     17) When execution of an END or RETURN statement causes a variable
         to become undefined, all variables of type C_PTR associated
         with that variable become undefined.

     18) When a variable with the TARGET attribute is deallocated, all
         variables of type C_PTR associated with that variable become
         undefined.

Issue 217 (page 387):

The issue questions the usefulness of multiple negative values for
the C kind type parameters for floating point data types defined in
the ISO_C_BINDING module.  Negative values indicate that no
corresponding Fortran kind type exists for the C type.  Original spec
and syntax provided only for a single negative value (-1) in the case
where there was not Fortran kind which was equivalent to the C type.
The additional values were added at the suggestion of full committee
we make no change at this time and delete the unresolved issue.

Edit: [387:38-44] delete
