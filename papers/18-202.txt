Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, the GB comment
059 reads:

"Clarification. The term "intrinsic type" is not defined in the C
standard. More precise wording is proposed."

with the suggested edit:

Change "Otherwise, the value for an intrinsic type shall be positive."
to "Otherwise, the value of a macro listed in Table 18.4 is positive."


Discussion
----------

Agreed. 


Edit to N2146
-------------

[494] In 18.5.4 Macros and typedefs in ISO_Fortran_binding.h,
paragraph 8, replace the last sentence, which currently reads
"Otherwise, the value for an intrinsic type shall be positive." with

"Otherwise, the value of a macro listed in Table 18.4 is positive."
