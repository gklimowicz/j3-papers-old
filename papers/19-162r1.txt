Introduction
------------

Fortran 2018 added, to intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING, the named constant
C_PTRDIFF_T, interoperable with the C type ptrdiff_t. Paper 11-161
at meeting 195 specifies this, but while it properly added the entry
to table 18.2, it missed an edit for 18.2.2p2 that lists all the
named constants for INTEGER kinds defined in the module. This paper
corrects that for the next revision. (The addition was properly
called out in the Introduction, though 11-161 omitted an edit for that.)

Edit to 18-007r1 for the next revision
--------------------------------------

[468:35, 18.2.2p3, Named constants and derived types in the module]

Replace "and C_INTPTR_T" with ", C_INTPTR_T, and C_PTRDIFF_T"
