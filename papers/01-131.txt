Subject: Ambiguity in the title of section 15


The current title of section 15, "Exceptions and IEEE Arithmetic,"
suggests to many readers that the section is concerned with a
general exception handling mechanism. It is, of course, concerned
only with arithmetic exceptions. In my view the report would
benefit by making this clear. I also believe, for stylistic
reasons, that any changes should be reflected in the content
of the first paragraph of section 15.

I have considered several alternative titles for section 15, i.e.,
    Arithmetic Exceptions and IEEE Arithmetic
    Floating Point Exceptions and IEEE Arithmetic
    IEEE Arithmetic and Exceptions
    IEEE Arithmetic and Arithmetic Exceptions
but only the first title strikes me as appropriate. The term
floating point is not used in the current draft and if used would
have to be defined. The last two versions suggest that the
exception model is intended only for systems with IEEE arithmetic,
while many features of the section are intended to be implementable
on non-IEEE systems.

Edits:

Insert the word "Arithmetic" at the start of the title of section 15.

In the first sentence of the first paragraph of section 15 insert
the word "arithmetic" before the phrase "exceptions and IEEE
arithmetic."
