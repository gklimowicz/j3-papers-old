Many if not most Fortran implementations support, as extensions,
degree-argument versions of some of the trigonometric intrinsic
functions, and these are widely used. In the spirit of standardizing
existing practice, we should add the following generic intrinsic
functions to the standard:

- ACOSD
- ASIND
- ATAN2D
- ATAND
- COSD
- SIND
- TAND

All of these would be similar to their radian-argument counterparts
except that the argument(s) are in degrees.

Degree versions of the hyperbolic trigonometric functions do not appear
to have wide support. JoR subgroup does not propose adding them:

- ACOSHD
- ASINHD
- ATANHD
- COSHD
- SINHD
- TANHD
