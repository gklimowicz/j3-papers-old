NUMBER: F08/xxxx
TITLE: Are certain expressions with pointer initialization constant?
KEYWORDS: constant, pointer initialization
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Under J3 consideration

QUESTION:

Given

  program P

    type :: T
      character(len=:), pointer :: P
    end type T
    character(len=10), target, save :: V = 'Value of V'
    real :: R
  1 type(t), parameter :: Z = t(v)
  2 type(t), parameter :: X = transfer(sqrt(transfer(z,r)),z)
  3 v = 'New Value'
  4 z%p = 'New Value'

  contains

    subroutine S

  5   character(len=*), parameter :: Y = z%p
  ...

(1)

are the initialization expressions in statements 1 and 2 constants?

(2)

are the assignments in statements 3 and 4 permitted?

(3)

is the initialization expression in statement 5 a constant?

ANSWER:

(1)

According to 7.1.12p1(3)(b), the initialization expressions in
statements 1 and 2 are constants.  Nonetheless, a processor cannot
evaluate the expression in statement 2 as a constant.  Edits are
provided to correct this oversight.

(2)

The assignment in statement 3 is permitted, but the one in statement 4
is not, because z%p is a subobject of a constant, and therefore is a
constant.  No edits are required.

(3)

According to 7.1.12p1(1) the initialization expression in statement 5
is a constant.  Nonetheless, although the pointer association status of
a subcomponent of an object is a constant, its target, if it has one, is
not a constant.  An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

EDITS:

(3)

In 7.1.12p1(1) insert "nonpointer" before "subobject".

(1)

In 7.1.12p1(6) insert ", or TRANSFER" after "THIS_IMAGE"

Insert a list item after 7.1.12p1(6)

"(6a) A reference to the intrinsic function TRANSFER, where each
      argument is a constant expression that does not have a pointer
      ultimate component,"
