Subject:   Ultimate components
From:      Dick Hendrickson


It seems that the definition of ultimate components only
extends to a depth of two. Should "ultimate components of
the components" at [56:9] by "components of the ultimate
components"?

Answer:  No. The definition of ultimate components extends
all the way to the leaves of the derived type.  The phrase
that begins "plus the ultimate components..." recurses.
