Discussion:
-----------

Comment 41 suggests inserting the extra paragraph shown below because
"it should be stated more clearly that segment ordering ensures memory
operation order, in the same way as line 5-13, page 212".

It might be thought that this is not needed because the topic is
already covered by the text in paragraph 3 of 11.6.2 Segments
[209:3-15].

The proposer, Yasuharu Hayashi from NEC says
"We agree that paragraph 3 of 11.6.2 can imply that segment ordering
ensures memory operation order.
However, we still think it is better to insert the paragraph we are
suggesting because paragraph 3 of 11.6.2 states the cases in which
data dependencies are prohibited but not the conditions in which
memory operation orders are ensured.
In very early versions of the coarray specification, data dependencies
among unordered segments were allowed, but the results were undefined
(i.e. memory operation orders were not ensured). Therefore, we think
that permission of data dependencies does not necessarily mean the
guarantee of memory operation orders."

There are two alternatives:
1. Make no change.
2. Make the edit suggested in comment 41.

These alternatives, along with 3) Undecided, were voted by the whole
committee.

The result of the vote was

1) 5 votes
2) 1 vote
3) 7 votes

Based on only one vote for making the edit, we decided to not make the
edit. It is not significantly different from the description of SYNC
MEMORY.
