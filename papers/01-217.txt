Date: 21st May 2001

1. Introduction

Issue 318 asks
  "Should a subobject of local variables also be considered a local
variable?
   The glossary entry seems to imply so."

I agree that the glossary entry seems to be at odds with our definition of
local variable.

The easiest fix is to alter the glossary.

A harder fix is to alter the definition and usage.

Edits are supplied for both options, I recommend just fixing the glossary.
(The only advantage I see for the alternative course is that the ordinary
usage of "variable" includes subobjects, whereas our new term "local
variable" does not.)

2. Simple edits to 01-007r1.

[403:41] Before "variable" insert "named".

3. Complicated edits to 01-007r1

[17:1] Before "<<local variable>>" insert "named".
[17:3+] Append to paragraph
        "A subobject of a named local variable is also a local variable."
{Alter local variable definition.}

[106:34] Delete "or a subobject thereof".
{No longer needed.}

[109:8] Insert "named" before "local variable".
{We really do want to restrict ourselves to named local variables.}

[109:11] Delete "or a subobject thereof".
{No longer needed.}
