Subject: Issue 69 : log2_images / rem_images
Reference: J3/06-007


Discussion of issue 69 (page 414)

The functions LOG2_IMAGES and REM_IMAGES were commonly used in early
parallel programs where having a power of 2 number of images was
important to some algorithms.  This restriction is largely obsolete
today.  In addition to the complaints from the Editor, the formulas
presented in the functions have poor performance.  We propose to
delete the Note.
 

Edit to J3/06-007

[414:18+] Delete Note 13.21.
