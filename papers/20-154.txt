Subject: IEEE 754 liason report
Date: 2020-October-12

The ISO/IEC version of IEEE Std 754-2019 was published in
May of 2020.  It is listed on the ISO website as
ISO/IEC 60559:2020.

We should update the reference to ISO/IEC 60559 in the
references subclause of the draft standard.

The only recent activity on the IEEE 754 working group
e-mail list was the announcement of the IEEE conference
ARITH 2021.
