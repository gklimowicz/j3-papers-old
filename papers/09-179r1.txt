Discussion

This sentence, in para 2 of 13.1 specifies the effect of an atomic
subroutine:
"The effect of executing an atomic subroutine is as if the action on
the ATOM argument occurs instantaneously, and thus does not interfere
with other atomic actions that might occur asynchronously."

This sentence references timing consideration that confuse the intent
of specifying what we mean by "atomic".

An edit is provided to correct this.

[319:12-14] In 13.1, para 2, change the second sentence from
"The effect of executing an atomic subroutine is as if the action on
the ATOM argument occurs instantaneously, and thus does not interfere
with other atomic actions that might occur asynchronously."

to

"The effects of any two atomic subroutine calls with a particular
variable as the ATOM argument do not interfere with each other."
