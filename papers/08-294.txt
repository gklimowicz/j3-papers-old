This paper aims to solve the problem discussed in section B. of N1754,
along the lines indicated in N1756. The relevant section of N1756 is
reproduced here to motivate the edits to the standard that follow.

The example program in section D. of N1754 is a bit of a red herring
since deadlock situations with companion processors or I/O may also
occur if only two images are involved. The author has however, in my
opinion, hit on a bug in the specification that must be fixed in
8.5.1 para6. In the first bullet of para6, the following situations
are covered:


----------------------------------------------------------------
Legend:
P, Q, ... are image numbers
a is a coarray
S(XY) is a pairwise sync which induces segment ordering for the
two involved images.
Time goes downward ... whatever that means.
----------------------------------------------------------------


              P             Q
              |             |
              |             | a = ...
        S(PQ) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                RAW
              |             |
 ... = a[Q]   |<------------|


and further diagrams covering WAW (push instead of pull by P), WAR.
What is however not covered correctly are the cases in the lower
part of the following diagram:

              P             Q            R
              |             |            |
              |  ... = a[R] |<-----------|
        S(PQ) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~            |   WAR (R "passive")
              |             |            |
 a[R] = ...   |------------------------->|
              |             |            |
        S(PR) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              |       S(QR) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              |             |            |
              |  ... = a[R] |<-----------|   RAW (R "passive")
              |             |            |   (or WAW, R "passive",
                                              not shown)

Indeed it appears the present formulation of the draft standard
requires S(PQ) twice in the above diagram, making it look like a
one-sided MPI call with a passive partner (not implemented e.g.,
in MPICH2 or Intel MPI for good reason).
In my opinion, R should only be passive with respect to references
to a, but not with respect to requiring a

sync images (/P,Q,R/)

(as drawn in the diagram) for the RAW case, as images P and Q do.
However, for WAR indeed only S(PQ) is needed.

So I think it is appropriate to introduce the concept of an image
being "owner" of a coarray and changing the first bullet to cover
all conceivable transactions with the owner. If this is done, one
obtains 16 elementary access sequences, of which 12 involve
updates. Of these, 9 involve image communication, and of these
again, the above 3 need special treatment.



Edits to 08-007r2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[35] add two new paragraphs to 2.5.7:

4+1 A coarray update may happen on either the image owning it (Uo),
    or a remote image (Ur). Coarray updates comprise
    * the definition or undefinition of a coarray variable either
      on the image owning it (Uo), or a remote image (Ur).
    * the allocation of an allocatable subobject of a coarray or
      pointer association of a pointer subobject of a coarray by
      the image owning it (Uo).

    Note 2.17+

    The definition or undefinition by a remote image of a noncoarray
    dummy argument whose effective argument is a coarray is not
    counted as a coarray update. To prevent (existing) noncoarray
    code from breaking, this case receives special treatment with
    respect to image execution (8.5.1).

4+2 A coarray reference from the image owning it is denoted by (Ro);
    a coarray reference from any other image is denoted by (Rr).

[32] add a new section:

2.4.6 Coarray access sequence

1 During execution of all images of a program, the sequence of all
  references or definitions of a coarray entity owned by a
  particular image (2.5.7) is composed of (possibly overlapping)
  elementary access sequences.

2 There exist 16 elementary access sequences:
  * (Ro) after (Ro), (Ro) after (Rr), (Rr) after (Ro), (Rr) after (Rr)
  * (Ro) after (Uo), (Ro) after (Ur), (Rr) after (Uo), (Rr) after (Ur)
  * (Uo) after (Ro), (Uo) after (Rr), (Ur) after (Uo), (Ur) after (Rr)
  * (Uo) after (Uo), (Uo) after (Ur), (Ur) after (Uo), (Ur) after (Ur)


[188] replace para6 of 8.5.1 by

6 For all elementary access sequences of which neither uses the
  GET_ATOMIC or SET_ATOMIC intrinsics,

  (C848+1) the segment of the image owning the coarray shall be
           ordered with respect to the segment of the remote image
           referencing the coarray for the access sequences
           (Ro) after (Ur), (Rr) after (Uo),
           (Uo) after (Rr), (Ur) after (Uo),
           (Uo) after (Ur), (Ur) after (Uo).

  (C848+2) the segment of both remote images shall be ordered
           with respect to the image owning the coarray for
           the access sequences (Rr) after (Ur), (Ur) after (Ur).
           If the remote images are not the same image, the segments
           of the remote images shall also be ordered with respect to
           one another.

  (C848+3) the segment of two different remote images shall be
           ordered with respect to one another for the access sequence
           (Ur) after (Rr).

7 For all elementary access sequences by two different images which
  contain at least one coarray update, and of which exactly one
  image executes a GET_ATOMIC or SET_ATOMIC intrinsic on the coarray,

  (C848+4) the segments of the two involved images shall be ordered
           with respect to one another.

8 For all elementary access sequences by two different images which
  contain at least one coarray update, and for which at least one
  image executes a procedure in segments Pi, Pi+1 , ..., Pk for which
  the coarray is an effective argument associated with a non-coarray
  dummy argument,

  (C848+5)  the coarray shall not be referenced, defined, or become
            undefined on the other image Q in a segment Qj unless Qj
            precedes Pi or succeeds Pk.

  Note 8.30:

  Any prescribed image ordering must be consistent with the semantics
  of the elementary access sequence it is associated with.

  Note 8.31

  The processor may optimize the execution of a segment as if it were
  the only image in execution. In particular, this applies to
  elementary access sequences which do not involve updates, and to
  elementary access sequences which contain references and/or updates
  by the owning image only.

  Note 8.31+1
  The model upon which the interpretation of a program is based is
  that there is a permanent memory location for each coarray and that
  all images can access it. In practice, an image may make a copy of
  a coarray (in cache or a register, for example) and, as an
  optimization, defer copying a changed value back to the permanent
  location while it is still being used. It is safe to defer this
  transfer until the end of the current segment and thereafter to
  reload from permanent memory any coarray that was not defined within
  the segment. It would not be safe to defer these actions beyond the
  end of the current segment since another image might reference the
  variable then.

  Note 8.31+2
  The incorrect sequencing of image control statements can suspend
  execution indefinitely. For example, one image might be executing
  a SYNC ALL statement while another is executing an ALLOCATE
  statement for a coarray.


Further comment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The above edits assume that VOLATILE coarrays have been
   disallowed, and be replaced by the atomic statements or
   intrinsics suggested in N1753.
