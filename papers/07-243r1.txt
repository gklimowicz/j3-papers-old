1. Edits w.r.t. 07-007r2

[279:26-28]---------------------------------------------------------------
It is specified that the entire output field is filled with asterisks if
the edit descriptor specifies an exponent width and the number of
digits in the exponent is greater than the specified width.  At [282:1-2],
[283:1-2], and [284:1-2] it simply says the edit descriptor form that
doesn't specify the exponent width shall not be used if |exp| > 999.  
Apparently an Ew.dE4 descriptor produces a well defined result and an
Ew.d is prohibited for an exponent > 999; even though the default
exponent field width is effectively 4.  What's wrong with filling the 
field with asterisks?  Isn't that what all current processors do?

The first sentence of (5) on 279 could be read to mean that only the named
descriptors write asterisks if the value is too wide; reverse the sense of
the sentence.

The edit also changes the sentence to use "E" instead of "Ew.d Ee".  This
is an incompatible change from F2003 in the sense that previously a program
was not allowed to output a value with an exponent > 999 using an Ew.d
descriptor.  With this change, a previously non-conforming program now
becomes conforming with a specific interpretation—all asterisks.  Similar 
comments apply to the D, ES, EN, and G descriptors.

To cover the change we could insert a paragraph something like
[3:18+]  Insert a paragraph
"Previously, it was not allowed to output a value using an
Ew.d, Dw.d, ENw.d, ESw.d or Gw.d edit descriptor if the absolute value of
the exponent exceeded 999.  This standard now defines the results."
however, I don't think we normally list previously undefined/disallowed
things that now have a meaning as an incompatibility since we'd have
to list every new feature.  

Edits:

Delete the sentence "The edit ... 999." at [282:1-2], [283:1-2], and
[284:1-2].

[279:26]  Replace the first sentence of item (5) by

"On output, if an exponent exceeds its specified or implied width using 
the D, E, EN, ES or G edit descriptors, or if the number of
characters produced exceeds the field width, the processor shall fill
the entire field of width <w> with asterisks."
