Discussion:
-----------

It was expected (at least by the HPC group) that the team variable
values on the images of a team would differ from image to image. While
some of the data in the team variable value, such as the identity of
the parent team and the number of images in the team, will be the same
for all images, other data will not be. In particular, the image index
when executing in the team is different for every image. Because
NEW_INDEX= is permitted in FORM TEAM, there is no simple way to
compute the image index based on other data in the team variable,
short of including a full translation table in each images' team
variable value. Because a full translation table uses an unscalable
amount of memory, the image index will almost certainly be included in
the data that makes up the team variable value for each image.

The assumption that team variable values differ among images was
expressed in TS 18508 by the final sentence of para. 1 of 5.1:
"Information about the team to which the current image belongs can be
determined by the processor from the collective value of the team
variables on the images of the team.". This sentence has not been
copied across to the draft standard, but clearer words would be
better. A simple way to achieve this is to say that each team value
identifies an image as well as a team.

The edits are slightly changed from those in the ballot.
The proposed edit for comment 043 also addresses comment 032,
therefore there is no separate edit for comment 032.
Also an edit for [445:36] has been added.


Edits to 17-007r2:
---------------

[139:29] In 9.6, Image selectors, para 3, first sentence, change
"identify" to "refer to the executing image and".

[213:3,4] In 11.6.6, SYNC TEAM statement, para 1, change "identify" to
"refer to the executing image and". Delete the sentence
"The executing ..."

[214:34] In 11.6.9, FORM TEAM statement, para 2, final sentence, change
"identifies" to "refers to that image and".

[389:14-16] In 16.9.85, GET_TEAM ([LEVEL]), para 5, change
"identifies" to "refers to the executing image and", thrice.

[445:36] In 16.10.2.32 TEAM_TYPE, para 2, first sentence, change
"identify" to "refer to an image and".
