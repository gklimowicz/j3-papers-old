Assuming Nick Maclaren's analysis is correct,
I don't quite like his words.  But this is a small
enough fix so I don't mind taking a swing at it.
I think my words are more explicitly what is meant,
but I don't feel strongly either way.

I (slightly) prefer:

Edits:
28:8 After "unit." Add
"Comments appearing after a program unit are part of the
subsequent program unit, if any.
If there is no subsequent program unit,
the comments are not associated with any program unit."

29:24 After the last "unit." Add
"Comments appearing after a program unit are part of the
subsequent program unit, if any.
If there is no subsequent program unit,
the comments are not associated with any program unit."
