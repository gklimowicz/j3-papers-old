TITLE: nonadvancing output followed by list directed output

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
    Section 10.8.2, last sentence.  If nonadvancing output is
    followed by list-directed output, is a blank required before
    the first character written?  (I assume that if the first
    character of the current record is not a blank, list-directed
    output is not required, though possibly permitted, to replace
    that character with a blank.)

ANSWER: No.

DISCUSSION:

Following the non-advancing output operation, the location for the
start of the next output operation is within the current record.  The
list-directed output operation begins at this location. List-directed
output is an advancing output operation. Following the list-directed
output the file position is after the just-written record.

If the location for the start of the list-directed output operation is
at the beginning of the record, a blank is written to the first
location.  Otherwise, no characters are inserted between the end of
the non-advancing output and the start of the list-directed output.

EDIT: None.
