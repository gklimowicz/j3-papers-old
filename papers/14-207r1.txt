1. Introduction

These are additional editorial changes.  No technical effects are intended
except as a by-product of making something make sense.

There may be interactions between these edits and other editorial and
technical papers; the editor should resolve these when entering the edits.


2. Discussion

Some of these are additional fixups near places fixed by 14-188, i.e.
the editor did not discover all the "bad language" usage.  It is entirely
likely that bad language yet remains.
