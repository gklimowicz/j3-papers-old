Introduction
------------

[96:13-14] and [123:10-11] say superficially similar but subtly different
things about whole arrays.

The material at [96:13-14] is more nearly correct because it doesn't
permit whole arrays as arguments to specification functions that require
the shape, which the material at [123:12-13] appears to allow.  OTOH, it
doesn't mention the appearance of assumed-size arrays in nonexecutable
statements.

In any case, discussion of both whole arrays and assumed-size arrays
shouldn't be spread between 5.3.7.5 (Assumed-size array) and 6.2.1 (Whole
array).  We can at least get all of the material about one of them into
one place.  Edits below put all of the material about whole arrays into
6.2.1.

Edits
-----

[96:13-14] Editor: Replace "name ... required" by "shall not appear in a
context that requires its shape".  Notice that this replaces text edited
by 07-188r1.

[123:10] Editor: After "executable construct" insert "or specification
expression".

[123:9-13] Editor: After doing the previous edit, join the paragraphs and
move the second sentence to the end.
