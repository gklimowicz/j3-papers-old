NUMBER: F08/0020
TITLE: FINDLOC and logical arguments.
KEYWORDS: Intrinsic, Function
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider
  REAL :: array(1000),value
  COMPLEX :: carray(1000),cvalue
  LOGICAL :: ilarray(1000),ilvalue
  ...
  PRINT *,FINDLOC(array,value)
  PRINT *,FINDLOC(carray,cvalue)
  PRINT *,FINDLOC(ilarray,ilvalue)

Are any of the references to FINDLOC standard-conforming?

13.7.61 requires of the VALUE argument that it
   "shall be ... in type conformance with ARRAY, as specified in Table
   7.2 for relational intrinsic operations 7.1.5.5.2).".

Yes, there is an unpaired parenthesis.

More to the point:
 (a) Table 7.2 is in 7.1.5.1 not in 7.1.5.5.2;
 (b) there is no table about type conformance in 7.1.5.5.2,
 (c) for type logical, the comparison is allegedly done by .EQV.,
     but that is not a relational operator.

It could be argued that the reference to 7.1.5.5.2 is just misleading,
and reading the rest of the sentence we should indeed use Table 7.2,
with the conformance as specified for the relational operators.  That
would make the first reference to FINDLOC conforming.

The second reference to FINDLOC is more problematic, because some
relational operators permit complex arguments (e.g. .EQ.) and some do
not (.LE.).  This makes it ambiguous as to whether or not it is
conforming.

The third reference to FINDLOC is the most problematic, because no
relational operators permit logical arguments.  Later on, FINDLOC
says it uses .EQV. for logical comparison, but .EQV. is a logical
operator not a relational operator, so in any case VALUE cannot
satisfy the rules in Table 7.2.

ANSWER:

These were all intended to be standard-conforming.  Edits are supplied
to correct the requirement.

EDITS to 10-007:

[347:31-32] In 13.7.61p3, VALUE argument, replace "for ... )" by
            "for the operator == or the operator .EQV.".
{NB: Use the same operators as specified in 13.7.61p6.  Use
 disjunction to avoid misinterpreting it as requiring both at once.}
