[1:25 1.1p4] Replace "determining" with "specifying".

{The mechanism for "determining" the number of images of a program is
the intrinsic function NUM_IMAGES.}

[24:24-25 1.5p4] Replace "given the EXTERNAL attribute (5.3.9) in its
scope (2.2.1)" with "has the EXTERNAL attribute (5.3.9) where it is
referenced".

{What does "its scope" mean?  The scope of the reference, the scope of
declaration of the name, or the scope of definition of the subprogram?
What if the name is accessed by use or host association, and the name is
given the EXTERNAL attribute in the place from which it is accessed?
What if the name is given the EXTERNAL attribute in some scoping unit
from which it is NOT accessed at the point of reference?}

[26:20 1.6.6p1] Replace "one of the" with "any".

{What if the program uses two of the deleted features?}

[26:36, 39 1.6.7p1] Replace "one of the" with "any".

[26:39 1.6.7p1] Replace "one of these" with "any"

{What if the program uses two of the deleted or processor-dependent
features?}

[106:12] Replace "type" with "method", "means", or "variety" (editor's
choice).

{"Type" has a precise meaning in the Fortran standard, which does not
apply here.}
