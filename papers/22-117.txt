Subject: HUGE is incomplete. C_LOC has a redundant description.
Date: 2022-February-03
Reference: 22-007

The description of the HUGE intrinsic function is "Largest model value",
which is incomplete if the argument is of enumeration type.

[398:2 16.9.96p1 HUGE] After "value" include ", or last enumerator in
the type definition".

[398:5 16.9.96p5 HUGE] Putting the condition at the end of a sentence is
off putting. Replace "The" with "If X is of type real, the" and delete
"if X is of type real" at the end of the phrase.

[504:9 18.2.3.7p3 LOC] Remove "a variable with interoperable type and kind
type parameters," because that is included in "a nonpolymorphic
variable...." Remove the comma after "assumed-type variable".

[504:19 18.2.3.7p5 LOC] Replace "to the first element of X" with "=>
X(@LBOUND(X))".

[504:25 18.2.3.7p5 LOC] Insert "executing" before "the pointer
assignment".
