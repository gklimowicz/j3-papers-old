Subject: Synchronization of CHANGE TEAM and END TEAM
Date:    28 June 2013
References: N1967, N1971

Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~

N1967 presently specifies that for both the CHANGE TEAM and END TEAM
statements, synchronization of all images of the parent team is
required, implying that all these images are obliged to execute these
statements.  This paper relaxes the requirement, replacing it by one
that synchronization only applies to individual subteams in the
decomposition established by FORM SUBTEAM.


Edits to N1967:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[9:5-6] Delete "Except by ... the team."

[10:11-16] Replace paragraph by

"The CHANGE TEAM and END TEAM statements are image control statements.
 When a CHANGE TEAM statement is executed, there is an implicit
 synchronization of all images of the team identified by <team-variable>;
 the executing image shall be a member of this team.  On each image of the
 team, execution of the segment following the statement is delayed until
 all the other images of the team have executed the same statement the same
 number of times.  When a CHANGE TEAM construct completes execution, there
 is an implicit synchronization of all images in its team.  On each image
 of the team, execution of the segment following the END TEAM statement is
 delayed until all the other images of the team have executed the same
 construct the same number of times."


Edits to the standard (TS section 8):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~[...] denotes an addition to existing text.

[27:18+] Add this new edit to 8.5 Edits to Clause 8

{In 8.5.4 SYNC IMAGES statement, edit paragraphs 1 - 3 as follows}

"If <image-set> is an array expression, the value of each element
 shall be positive and not greater than the number of images
 ~[of the current team], and there shall be no repeated values.

 If image-set is a scalar expression, its value shall be positive and
 not greater than the number of images ~[of the current team].

 An <image-set> that is an asterisk specifies all images ~[of the
 current team]."
