TITLE: Interpretation request concerning DATA
KEYWORDS: DATA, substring
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: 

QUESTION:

Does the following program unit conform to the 2003 Fortran standard?

  subroutine S ( N )

    character(3) :: Z(2)

    data ( c(i)(n:n), i = 1, 2 ) / 'A', 'B' /

  end subroutine s

ANSWER

No.  It was an oversight that substring starting and ending points were
not included in C561, as they are in C554.

EDITS

Within C561 [88:13] replace "subscript" by "subscript, substring starting
point, or substring ending point".
