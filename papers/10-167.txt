TITLE: Elemental subroutine restrictions.
KEYWORDS: ELEMENTAL, SUBROUTINE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following elemental subroutine

  ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE test_add(a,b)
    REAL,INTENT(IN) :: a,b
    REAL c
    c = a*b
  END SUBROUTINE

and the following reference:

  REAL x(10),y
  LOGICAL toobig
  ...
  CALL IEEE_SET_FLAG(IEEE_OVERFLOW,.FALSE.)
  CALL test_add(x,y)
  CALL IEEE_GET_FLAG(IEEE_OVERFLOW,toobig)

The subroutine test_add does not do anything useful other than to
set the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag when x+y would overflow.

Is this program fragment standard-conforming?

12.8.3 says
  "In a reference to an elemental subroutine, either all actual
   arguments shall be scalar, or all actual arguments corresponding to
   INTENT (OUT) and INTENT (INOUT) dummy arguments shall be arrays of
   the same shape and the remaining actual arguments shall be
   conformable with them."

Obviously, it is not the case that all actual arguments are scalar.
However, there not being any actual arguments corresponding to
INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT) dummy arguments, it is not possible for
the remaining actual arguments (x and y) to be conformable with them.

Is this an oversight?  (If not, it seems a very clumsy way of
requiring elemental subroutines to have an INTENT(OUT) or
INTENT(INOUT) argument, and one that doesn't work if they are only
referenced with scalar arguments either.)

ANSWER:

Yes, the program fragment is intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to correct the oversight in the standard.

EDITS to 10-007:

[314:16-19] In 12.8.3, replace the second sentence "In ... them." by
  "In a reference to an elemental subroutine, actual arguments that
   correspond to INTENT (OUT) or INTENT (INOUT) dummy arguments shall
   either be all be scalar or all be arrays.  All actual arguments
   shall be conformable."

NOTE: This edit is potentially subsumed by the edit in the interp
      "Impure elemental restrictions".
