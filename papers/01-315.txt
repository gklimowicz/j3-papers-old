Subject:  Response to a WG5 comment (value attribute)

One of the comments made by WG5 members at the recent London meeting
expressed a concern regarding the value attribute of dummy arguments.
The criticism was that we hadn't thought this through very well.
Fortran supports the value attribute for arguments of bind( c)
procedures only.  The question was raised regarding why not allow
it generally, since anyone wishing to use it will simply write the
interface to specify bind( c) .  So the limitation is not effective
and attempts to make it so only cause further damage.  J3 members
present were unable to provide a good answer to this question.
WG5 expressed its desire to remove the restriction on value arguments
from the draft.  This paper is a vehicle for removing the restriction
on value arguments from the draft should J3 decide to do so, or
alternatively, for replying to WG5 with our reasons why the
restriction on value arguments should be kept in the draft.

To remove the restriction on value from the draft:

(This version removes the restriction on value,
if J3 decides to keep it, we can replace this version
with an explanation of why we want to do so.)
