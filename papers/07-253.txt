Subject: UTI 118 (pp 28-29): Error list redundant

Discussion

The editor suggests that the list of ways that error termination can
occur be deleted since it duplicatates text elsewhere in the
standard. We agree.  It is hard to ensure that the list is complete
and that every item is correct.  If an edit is made elsewhere, there
is a danger of overlooking the corresponding edit in this list.

Note that if this is adopted, no response to UTI 117 is needed.

Edits to 07-007r2:

[28:19] In 2.4.5 Execution sequence, para. 6, append to the first line
"an ALL STOP statement is executed or an error condition occurs."

[28:20-33] In 2.4.5 Execution sequence, delete the remainder of
para. 6.
