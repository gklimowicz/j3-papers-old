Subject: R6.b Polymorphism (Dynamic Dispatch) Syntax

1. Introduction

This is the syntax to satisfy the requirement for the ability to invoke
dynamically bound procedures where the actual procedure invoked depends on the
runtime type of a single, potentially polymorphic, associated variable.  Such
procedures are bound to the type of an entity, whereas a procedure component is
bound to the contents (value) of an entity.

Specifications for this requirement are in 97-230r1.

We will call these "type-bound procedures", since their accessibility and
dynamic-dispatch resolution are bound to the (runtime) type of an entity.
[Nomenclature borrowed from Oberon-2].

2. Applicability

Type-bound procedures are permitted for both non-extensible types and
extensible types, but dynamic dispatch only ever occurs when extensible
types are involved.

[The specifications had the restriction that type-bound procedures are only
allowed in extensible types.  This is unnecessary, since no runtime dispatch
table would be needed for non-extensible types.]

3. Scope

Type-bound procedure names are in the same name class as component names.

4. Declaration

A derived type need not have any component-def statements.
It may have a type-bound procedure section following the
component-def statements if any.

R422 <derived-type-def> <<is>> <derived-type-stmt>
                               [ <private-sequence-stmt> ] ...
                               [ <component-def-stmt> ... ]
                               [ <contains-stmt>
                                 [ <private-stmt> ]
                                 <tbp-spec-stmt> ... ]
                               <end-type-stmt>

<tbp-spec-stmt> <<is>> PROCEDURE [ [ , <tbp-attr-list> ] :: ]  <tbp-name>
                       [ => { <procedure-name> | <deferred-tbp> ) } ]

The name of a type-bound procedure and the name of the procedure that
implements it need not be the same.  This renaming allows a single module
to provide both a type and one or more extensions.  The actual procedure
shall be an accessible procedure that has an explicit interface.  If the
<procedure-name> is omitted, it has the same name as the type-bound procedure.

[The specifications had the restriction that the procedure be a module
procedure from the containing module; this is unnecessary and could
inhibit modularisation by the user.]

<tbp-attr> ::= PASS_OBJ | NON_OVERRIDABLE | <access-spec>

If a type-bound procedure name has the PASS_OBJ attribute, it shall
have a dummy argument of the type, and this dummy argument shall be a
scalar non-pointer polymorphic dummy variable.  When the type-bound
procedure is invoked through the type-bound procedure name, the object
through which the procedure is invoked is passed to this dummy
argument and any actual arguments are distributed to the other dummy
arguments according to the usual rules.  [See later example.]

[The specifications had the restriction that the dispatching argument
match the first dummy argument; this is unnecessary, all that is needed is
a simple rule to determine which argument is affected by PASS_OBJ.  The
rule is stated in 5. Invocation]

Example:
	TYPE,EXTENSIBLE :: vector_2d
		REAL x,y
	CONTAINS
		PROCEDURE,PASS_OBJ :: length => length_2d
	END TYPE

	REAL FUNCTION length_2d(v)
		OBJECT(vector_2d) v
		length_2d = SQRT(v%x**2+v%y**2)
	END FUNCTION

A type-bound procedure name that does not have the NON_OVERRIDABLE attribute
can be overridden in an extension of the type.  An override for a type-bound
procedure name shall specify the PASS_OBJ attribute if and only if the name
has the PASS_OBJ attribute in the parent type.

	TYPE,EXTENDS(vector_2d) :: vector_3d
		REAL z
	CONTAINS
		PROCEDURE,PASS_OBJ :: length => length_3d
	END TYPE
	REAL FUNCTION length_3d(self)
		OBJECT(vector_3d) self
		length_3d = SQRT(self%x**2+self%y**2+self%z**2)
	END FUNCTION

The NON_OVERRIDABLE attribute indicates that the type-bound procedure name
cannot be further overridden in an extension of this type.  This allows
static dispatch when the compiler can determine that the dispatching variable
is at least of this type.  [Another suggested spelling for this attribute is
"FROZEN".  Straw vote?]

5. Invocation

Reference to a named type-bound procedure looks just like a reference
to a procedure component.  If the type-bound procedure name has the
PASS_OBJ attribute, the object used to access the procedure becomes
associated with the first dummy argument of the type, e.g.
	TYPE(vector_2d) vec
        TYPE(vector_3d) x
	REAL size
	...
	size = vec%length()     ! Invokes length_2d(vec).
        size = x%length()       ! Invokes length_3d(x).

When invoked from a polymorphic entity, the runtime type determines the
procedure that is called, e.g.

        TYPE,EXTENDS(vector_2d) :: named_vector_2d
          CHARACTER*10 name
        END TYPE

        OBJECT(vector_2d) y
        ...
        size = y%length()
        !
        ! Invokes length_2d if the runtime type is vector_2d,
        !         length_2d if the runtime type is named_vector_2d,
        !         length_3d if the runtime type is vector_3d.

6. Overriding and Procedure Characteristics

When overriding a type-bound procedure without the PASS_OBJ attribute, all
characteristics of the overriding procedure shall be the same as that of the
procedure being overridden.

When overriding a type-bound procedure with the PASS_OBJ attribute, only the
characteristics of the dummy argument used for passing the invoking object
shall be different.  [The characteristics of this dummy argument are
specified above.]

If a type-bound procedure has the PURE attribute, any overriding procedure
shall also have the PURE attribute.

A type-bound procedure shall not have the ELEMENTAL attribute.

7. Deferred Type-Bound Procedures

<deferred-tbp> <<is>> NULL( [ <abstract-interface-name> ] )

Constraint: <abstract-interface-name> shall be present unless the
            <tbp-spec-stmt> is overriding an inherited type-bound procedure.

A <tbp-spec-stmt> that specifies the NULL intrinsic instead of a module
procedure name creates a deferred type-bound procedure.  Note that the
<abstract-interface-name> argument to the NULL intrinsic is required to
establish the characteristics of the type-bound procedure name unless those
have already been inherited.

An extension of a type containing such a deferred type-bound procedure shall
contain a <tbp-spec-stmt> that specifies a binding for each deferred name.
This new binding may confirm that the type-bound procedure name is still
deferred (e.g. by having "NULL()") or supply a specific procedure.

[The requirement that a deferred procedure have its deferredness be confirmed
or overridden is to help prevent errors.  It is not strictly necessary.]

For example:
	TYPE,EXTENSIBLE :: vector_0d
          ! No ordinary components
	CONTAINS
          PROCEDURE,PASS_OBJ :: length => NULL(procname)
	END TYPE

	TYPE,EXTENDS(vector_0d) :: vector_0d_special
          INTEGER special_value
	CONTAINS
          PROCEDURE,PASS_OBJ :: length => NULL()      ! Still deferred
	END TYPE
	! Note: No "procname" necessary when confirming abstraction.
	TYPE,EXTENDS(vector_0d) :: vector_1d
          REAL x
	CONTAINS
          PROCEDURE,PASS_OBJ :: length => length_1d  ! We now have a "length()"
	END TYPE

It is also possible to override an existing procedure binding with
the null binding, e.g.

	TYPE,EXTENDS(vector_1d) :: vector_2d ! A strange vector with no length
          REAL y
	CONTAINS
          PROCEDURE,PASS_OBJ :: length => NULL()
	END TYPE

It is possible to declare entities of TYPE(vector_0d) or OBJECT(vector_0d);
however it is a compile-time error to have a reference to "length" in a
TYPE(vector_0d) entity, and a runtime error to execute a reference to "length"
from an object that still has a deferred binding (e.g. the variable is
OBJECT(vector_0d) and the runtime type is TYPE(vector_0d_special)).

8. Visibility

The default visibility of a type-bound procedure is PUBLIC, i.e. the default
visibility of the section before the "CONTAINS" is separate from the default
visibility of the section after the CONTAINS.

This default may be changed with an explicit PRIVATE statement following the
CONTAINS, and may be overridden for individual procedures with an
accessibility attribute.

E.g.,
	TYPE mytype
		PRIVATE
		REAL x,y                          ! secret components
	CONTAINS
		PROCEDURE mean=>mean_mytype       ! public type-bound procedure
		PROCEDURE, PRIVATE :: hypot=>hypot_mytype   ! A private one
	END TYPE

	TYPE another
		LOGICAL available(100)          ! public components
	CONTAINS
		PRIVATE
		PROCEDURE secret=>proc1                 ! private procedures...
		PROCEDURE hidden=>proc2
		PROCEDURE, PUBLIC :: pub=>proc3         ! public procedure
	END TYPE

The rationale for resetting the default visibility on encountering the CONTAINS
is that it is anticipated that it would be common for the user to require
private (or mostly private) components but to have public type-bound procedures
(e.g. which could include functions which access the private components).
