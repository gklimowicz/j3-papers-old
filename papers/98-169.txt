                                                                  WG5-N1323
                       RESOLUTIONS OF THE WG5 MEETING
                  ON 8 TO 12 JUNE 1998 IN TROLLHŽTTAN, SWEDEN

The meeting was attended by the convenor and 13 members, representing 5
member bodies.  Resolutions T1, T2, T6, T8 and T10 were approved by
unanimous consent, T11 to T13 by unanimous acclaim; votes on the other
resolutions are shown following each resolution.

T1  WG5 Document Repository and Web Site
That WG5 confirms its intent to reorganize its electronic document
repository, along the lines described in WG5-N1302, and to provide web
access to these documents and other relevant sites.  A committee
comprising Malcolm Cohen, Miles Ellis, Kurt Hirchert and Jerry Wagener
is commissioned to develop the new repository and web site and to make a
beta version available to the WG5 membership by the end of 1998.

T2  Maintenance Procedures for Fortran 95
That WG5 notes that the Fortran 95 Standard has been published since its
previous meeting and reaffirms Dresden resolution D4 which thanks J3 for
agreeing to act as maintenance body for Fortran 95 and instructs its
maintenance body to accept Fortran 95 defect items directly from any WG5
member body or from the WG5 convenor.

T3  Schedule for Fortran 2000
That WG5 confirms the target schedule for the revision of Fortran
contained in Las Vegas resolution LV6 and adds two meeting dates as

T3 was approved with one country abstention (Germany).

T4  Part 2 of the Fortran Standard (Varying Length Strings) - Development Body
That WG5 instructs its convenor to request SC22 approval to change the
schedule for the revision of Part 2 of the Fortran Standard in order to
allow for additional development and to request SC22 to appoint John
Reid as Project Editor.  Further, WG5 thanks Lawrie Schonfelder for his
work over many years as Project Editor and appoints him Consultant to
the Project Editor.  WG5 establishes a development body for this project
and appoints the following members in addition to the Editor and
Consultant: Kurt Hirchert, Steve Morgan, Lars Mossberg and a participant
to be nominated by the German member body.
T4 was approved with one country abstention (US).

T5  Part 2 of the Fortran Standard (Varying Length Strings) - Content
That WG5 endorses the changes to the definition of the varying string
module recommended in WG5-N1319.  In addition, WG5 recommends that the
text of the demonstration implementation of the varying string module be
removed from the Standard.
T5 was approved with one individual abstention and country abstention (US).

T6  Internationalization
That WG5 advises its primary development body to develop the proposals
in WG5-N1320 in order to fulfil the requirements for
internationalization.

T7  Interoperability of Fortran and C
That WG5 supports the approach to interoperability with C outlined in
document WG5-N1321 (J3/98-165r1) and encourages the primary development
body to complete the work as a high priority item.  Further, WG5
encourages its members to participate in the development of this
requirement.
T7 was approved with one country abstention (Germany).

T8  Derived Type Input/Output
That WG5 notes that concern has been expressed that the current proposal
for derived type input/output is both inadequate and not amenable to
extension and urges the primary development body to consider the changes
proposed in WG5-N1322.  Further, WG5 encourages members wishing to
submit proposals in this area to do so in time for the August 1998
meeting of the primary development body.

T9  Interval Arithmetic
That WG5 acknowledges that the original requirements for interval
arithmetic cannot be completed within the current schedule and accepts
the recommendation of the primary development body to substitute
enabling technology.  Specifically, control of I/O rounding (J3
requirement code R4d) and constants for opaque types (R4f) should be
retained as requirements, and control of operation rounding (R4c) and
flexible optimization control (R4a) should be pursued as minor technical
enhancements, all subject to the constraint of the current schedule.
T9 was approved with one individual negative vote.

T10  Future Meetings
That WG5 thanks the French member body for offering to host the next WG5
meeting on June 21-25, 1999 and records its intent to add a joint
meeting with J3 in February or March 2001 to its current schedule of
meetings.

T11  Appreciation of Jerry Wagener
That WG5 records its appreciation of the many contributions to Fortran
standardization made by Jerry Wagener during the more than twenty years
preceding his recent retirement from the chair and membership of J3 and
from the US delegation to WG5.

T12  Vote of Thanks for Support for Meeting
That WG5 thanks H”gskolan i Trollh„ttan/Uddevalla, Saab Automobile,
Volvo Aero Corporation and Volvo Information Technology Corporation for
generously supporting the meeting.

T13   Vote of Thanks
That WG5 wishes to express its appreciation to the convenor (Miles
Ellis), the secretary (Keng Low), the librarian (Kurt Hirchert), the
drafting committee, the presenters of tutorials (Malcolm Cohen and John
Reid), the hosts (ITS Fortran Committee) and particularly the local host
Lars Mossberg, his wife Vivi-Anne and his colleagues Britt-Marie Carew,
Fredrik Jirholm, Eva Klevedal, Mats Lejon and Maud ™sterman for their
contribution to the success of the meeting.
