NUMBER: F08/0073
TITLE: Polymorphic auto-targetting
KEYWORDS: polymorphic, pointer, dummy
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

  Program m013
    Type t
      Real c
    End Type
    Type(t),Target :: x
    Call s(x)
    Print *,x%c
  Contains
    Subroutine s(p)
      Class(t),Pointer,Intent(In) :: p
      p%c = 3
    End Subroutine
  End Program

Is the invocation of S standard-conforming?

According to 12.5.2.5p2, because dummy P is polymorphic,
the actual argument is required to be polymorphic, even
though the dummy argument is not associated with the
actual argument.

ANSWER:

The invocation of S was intended to be standard-conforming;
the polymorphism-matching requirement in 12.5.2.5 was intended
to apply only when both the actual and dummy arguments were
pointers (or allocatables).

An edit is supplied to correct this mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[295:18] 12.5.2.5p2, change "The" to
  "Except in the case where the dummy argument is a pointer and the
   actual argument is not a pointer, the"
