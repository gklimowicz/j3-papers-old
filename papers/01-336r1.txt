Subject: Program terminology cleanup

This was left over from paper 01-321, item 1; the terminology for
"programs" and pieces thereof needs some fixes.

Note that paper 01-321 deleted "unit" at [12:10].

Note that [9:11-12] defines a "<main-program>" as a Fortran thing,
but a "main program" can be either a <main-program> or a main
program defined by means other than Fortran.

"Program units" will remain as Fortran defined things, and we will 
allow procedures and entities (i.e. data) defined by means other
than Fortran to be included in a "program".

Edits:

[12:10] Replace " and" with ","
[12:11] Replace "kinds of program units" with
                "kinds of program units, and any number (including zero)
                 of external procedures and entities defined by means
                 other than Fortran"

[12:20] Replace "The" with "The Fortran"

[15:5]  Replace "Execution" with "If a program contains a Fortran
        main program, execution" 

[231:7] insert "Fortran" before "main program"

[232:2] insert "Fortran" before "main program"

[232:5] insert "Fortran" before "main program"

[232:7] insert "Fortran" before "main program"

[232:11] insert "Fortran" before "main program"

[232:12] insert "Fortran" before "main program"
