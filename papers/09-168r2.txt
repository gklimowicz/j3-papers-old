Subject: LOCK_TYPE variables can't be actual arguments to INOUT dummies
Date: 2009 May 5
References: 09-007r1

1.  Discussion

C1302 overlooks the case of a coarray component of type LOCK_TYPE.

C1303 implies that variables of type LOCK_TYPE are not allowed to be
actual arguments associated with INTENT(INOUT) dummy arguments.

2.  Edits

[402:9-10 13.8.2.16 C1302]----------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the second sentence of C1302 with

"A named variable with a noncoarray subcomponent of type LOCK_TYPE
shall be a coarray."


[402:12 13.8.2.16 C1303]------------------------------------------------
Editor:  At the end of the constraint, append

", or as an actual argument in a reference to a procedure with an
explicit interface where the corresponding dummy argument has
INTENT(INOUT)".


[402:12+ 13.8.2.16]----------------------------------------------------
Editor: Add a new constraint:

"C1303a A variable with a subobject of type LOCK_TYPE shall not appear
in a variable definition context except as an actual argument in
reference to a procedure with an explicit interface where the
corresponding dummy argument has INTENT(INOUT)."


[461:10-11 16.6.7 List item (12)]-------------------------------------
Editor: Parallel change to the same wording in Variable Definition
context:

Replace "associated dummy argument has the" with "corresponding dummy
argument has", and Delete "attribute".
