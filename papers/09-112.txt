Discussion:

UTI 162 on page 402 notes that the kinds for the constants
ATOMIC_INT_KIND and ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND are not specified.  They
should be default integers. To regularize the text with that for other
scalar constants in the module (CHARACTER_STORAGE_SIZE, ERROR_UNIT,
...), the "named" before "constant" is also deleted.

Edits to 09-007:

[402:12] At the beginning of the text of "13.8.2.2 ATOMIC_INT_KIND"
replace "the integer scalar named constant" with "the default integer
scalar constant".

[402:15] At the beginning of the text of "13.8.2.3
ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND" replace "the integer scalar named constant" with
"the default integer scalar constant".
