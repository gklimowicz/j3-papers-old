Discussion

Comment GB43 asks for the replacement of A.1.1.

Edits to WG5/N1869

Replace the text of A.1.1 by

"The mechanism for handling unlimited polymorphic entities whose
dynamic type is interoperable with C is designed to handle the
following two situations:

(1) A formal parameter that is a C pointer to void. This is an address,
and no further information about the entity is provided. The formal
parameter corresponds to a dummy argument that is a nonallocatable
nonpointer scalar or is an array of assumed size.

(2) A formal parameter that is the address of a C descriptor.
Additional information on the status, type, size, and shape is
implicitly provided. The formal parameter corresponds to a dummy
argument that is of assumed shape or assumed rank.

In the first situation, it is the programmer's responsibility to
explicitly provide any information needed on the status, type, size,
and shape of the entity.

The examples A.1.2 and A.1.3 illustrate some uses of assumed-type
entities."
