Discussion

The second sentence of paragraph 6 in 13.3 Bit model refers to "one of
the bit manipulation procedures". In Fortran 2003 this was a well
defined list of procedures, itemized in subclause 13.5.9 "Bit
manipulation procedures".  That list is no longer in the f08 draft.
Instead of relying on a no-longer defined phrase, we should just say
the model applies in contexts where integers are interpreted as bit
sequences.


Edits to 07-007r3:

[340:7-9] In paragraph 6 of 13.3 Bit model, replace the second
sentence ("This model is valid ... IPARITY.")  with:

"This model is valid only in the context of the use of such an object
as the argument or result of an intrinsic procedure that interprets
that object as a sequence of bits."
