Subject: Editor's report for 09-007r1
Date: 2009 March 25

1. Additional editorial changes
-------------------------------

  Hyperlinked and indexed (or improved thereof):
     "argument keyword"
     "cosubscript"
     "declared type"
     "defined operation"
     "elemental"
     "image"
     "line" only within clause 3.  Maybe the term should have been "source
            line" instead (in which case it is close enough to general
            usage not to need to be a special term).
     "NaN"
     "pointer assignment statement"
     "polymorphic"
     "pure procedure"
     "scoping unit"
     "STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE"
     "statement keyword"
     "structure constructor"
     "type parameter keyword"
     "unit" (i.e. input/output unit)
  Also, many constructs and statements have been hyperlinked and indexed.
  Eliminated excess indexing in the syntax rule index.
  In c08, "GOTO statement"->"GO TO statement", twice.
  Added cross-ref to {D16:Pointer association status}
    in the definition of the term "defined" of a pointer.
  Changed all 2 occurrences of "pointer-associated"->"pointer associated".
  In C_FUNLOC,
    "implicit-interface procedure pointer component PX"
    ->"procedure pointer component PX wiht an implicit interface".
    {We don't use "implicit-interface" anywhere else.}
  In "The FORALL statement", added "statement" after "pointer assignment".
  Deleted "module procedure interfaces" from the list of class (1) names
    in c16; I leave it as an exercise to the reader to prove it was
    redundant.
  Changed all "is processor-dependent" to "is processor dependent" (well,
    all the ones I found anyway); we used both forms but the latter was
    more prevalent (62:11 not counting ones broken across lines) and is
    more consistent with our hyphenation "policy", such as it is.
  [c08 somewhere in a note] "image value"->"image index value".
  [ditto] "on any of the other images"->"on any other image".
  [25:1] Deleted "terms and" (the terms are now in clause 1).
  [25:3] "terms"->"syntax".  Maybe it should be "syntax terms", but plain
         "terms" just seems wrong.
  [45:9-10] "default kind characters"->"characters of default kind" for
    consistency with the wording at [43:22].
  [75:2-3] There is no such thing as an END PROGRAM statement, reworded
           to use the syntax term instead.
  [189:15+9,29] There is no such thing as an END PROGRAM statement,
                reworded to use the syntax term instead.
  [335:22] Revise description (edit missing in 09-007).
  [386:15-17] Reworded to improve typesetting and consistency.
  [404:6,405:21] "kinds of a"->"a kind with" (larger size); otherwise it
    could be read as applying when more than one kind (with larger size) is
    supported rather than one or more.
  [416:5] Inserted an indefinite article.  Now the sentence is
          grammatical; it is still wrong though.
  [416:28] Delete excessive vertical space and extraneous paragraph number.
  [417:6] Delete excessive vertical space and extraneous paragraph number.
  [417:19] Delete excessive vertical space and extraneous paragraph number.
  [418:27] Removed extra parenthesis.
  [419:4] Removed extra parenthesis.
  [419:4-5] Didn't change this, but does IEEE_SUPPORT_SQRT really require
            (and/or imply) IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN?  Daft.
  [419:19] Reworded to match the phrasing used in similar cases nearby.
  [511:34] Moved to [511:37+] (was out of order).
  [535:5,10] "has"->"had" to improve grammar.  If the main verb is
    conditional ("had") the governed verb must be subjunctive (viz "would
    be" not "is").
  [535:9] Removed tildes.
  [535:10] Re-typeset to avoid overlong line and "value" too close to "[".
  [535:14] Revised spacing.
  [535] Rewrote C.13.3.6-7 to simplify and use maths for the mathematical
    content.  Removed last sentence of C.13.3.7 as it is not about matrix
    norms.  I wonder why we only provided NORM2 for REAL and not COMPLEX.
  [c14 throughout] Formatted:
    (a) inserted blank between name and left parenthesis of function
        reference (to match our normal style outside of code font);
    (b) inserted blank between comma and following argument ditto;
    (c) turned several hyphens into minus signs.
    This does make things take up more room, but they are more readable
    apart from being stylistically more consistent.
  [c13 throughout] Similar changes and various spacing tweaks.

2. Editorial Suggestions for Further Consideration
--------------------------------------------------
  It seems to me that "operand" and "operator" are normal usage.
  Can we not just delete these terms?

3. Comments re Indexing
-----------------------

I have two families of macros that I use for hyperlinking, one adds an
index entry, the other does not.  Defined terms should always be
hyperlinked.  Whether each occurrence should be indexed is another
question.

My general guideline is that if the text is about the term, concept or
feature itself, it should be indexed.  If the text is about a "canonical"
usage of the feature, it should be indexed.  If it is a trivial usage of
the term that throws no light on its meaning or use, it should not be
indexed.

There is a wide grey area between canonical usage and trivial usage, where
judgement is required.  I'm sure that occasionally in a long indexing
session I have gone into a sort-of-autopilot "index everything" mode.  It
would probably be a good idea to remove some of the less useful of those
index entries, especially for those terms which have a very long list of
entries (if the list is short it doesn't matter so much).

In general, when in doubt I have indexed it (it is easier to notice
unnecessary index entries than to spot ones that are missing!).  Any
suggestions as to removal of extraneous entries or addition of new entries
will be given due consideration.

4. Rejected papers
------------------

115r1s3
  REJECTED.
  This change appears to be an incomplete addition of a new feature.

5. Passed papers with commentary
--------------------------------

103s3

104 last paragraph only.

105s2 applied as amended:
  after "editing done by" inserted additional "the".
  "scale factor effect" -> "effect" etc.
  {The lead-in sentence says this is how k affects the editing.}
106r1 applied with the list items joined to the previous list.
107r1 aa
  Added index entry for I/O rounding mode to IEEE_SUPPORT_IO.
110 revised appearance.

112
  Removed UTI 162.

113r1
  Also [39:7] unemboldened "Fortran character set" and indexed as
    definition; (missing edit - the witter at the top said we would
    determify it though).
  Added cross-ref to the edit at [58:3].

114r3
  [268:24]
    There's no such thing as a "<namelist-group>".
      There are "<namelist-group-object>" and "<namelist-group-name>",
      but not "<namelist-group>".  Rewrote the offending sentence.
    Rewrote the "Subscripts" sentence into the singular.
    Simplified the "derived type" sentence; changed "the name in the
      input record" to "the designator in the input record" (bug).
    A "zero-sized array section" *IS* a "zero-sized array", but I did not
      remove this redundancy.
  [269:1-3]
    Again, no such thing as "<namelist-group>"; reworded.
  EXTRA EDIT: [269:21] After "name-value", "sequence"->"subsequence".
  [269:20-21]
    Again, no such thing as "<namelist-group>"; reworded.

116r1

117
  In the second edit, changed ATOMIC_INT_KIND to KIND(VALUE).
  Removed UTI 154.

118r1
  Having a subclause that is just a syntax rule and a constraint is pretty
  bad style, so I added a sentence to introduce it.

  I still don't like the name of the syntax term.

119r3
  Changed one "can" to "could" in the note.

121r1s3
  [436:22] Instead, just deleted "contiguous" (we still need to require it
           to be a variable).
  A couple of commas already existed so I didn't insert extra ones.

122r1
  parenthesised cross-refs in binding, binding name.
  fixed extraneous R at [13:11].
  Also indexed "imaginary part" as definition.
  Improved hyperlinking/indexing of "kind type parameter" in c04.
  Didn't do [104:28(5.4.7p9)] After "compatible" insert "(4.5.4.6)",
    cross-ref appears later in the sentence.
  [113:22] Deleted duplicate cross-reference.
123
124
125
  [141:16(7.1.5.1,title)] different capitalization
  [167:21] Reworded.

126r1
  It turns out we used "branch target statement" with two different
    meanings:
      (1) statement that is permitted to be the target of a branch,
      (2) statement that is actually the target of a branch;
    rewrote the term definition so it works for both of them.
  Changed several cross-references to "D8:Image control statements" to
    reference the new "D8:Segments" instead.

127r1
  "defined input/output" already existed as a term, but was not properly
    hyperlinked and the definition was not as good.
  The definition of the term "record" is somewhat lacking and needs
    improvement.
  [199:9(9.1p3)] Hyperlinked the keywords to the statement subclauses.
  Indexed all of 9.5 "File connection" for "file connection".
  Indexed "wait operation" everywhere it appeared in c09.
  Hyperlinked several of the i/o statements.

128
129r1
130r1
  [277:9-10] didn't insert 12.6.2.5 because we already did it earlier in
    the paragraph in the precious edit.
  Also reworded C1247 and C1248.
  Changed a lot of "within the <prefix> in" to "in the <prefix> of".
  Changed "length of the abstract" to "length of the synopsis" in a note.

131r3
  [88:20-21 5.3.4 ASYNCHRONOUS attribute]
    I think the proposed edit made the text more confusing, so I changed it
    the same way I did for VOLATILE below.
  [100:6-8 VOLATILE attribute]
    The first sentence is practically vacuous, I added some more worms;
    these need to be reviewed.  Furthermore, the forward reference to
    pointer assignment is wrong.  This needs more work: added UTI 163.
  [101: NOTE 5.25]
    Deleted the note instead: see comment for 455:1.
  [301:9 12.5.2.8 Coarray dummy variables]
    Also additionally moved p2 to follow p1, so that the notes are all at
    the end.  Since notes 12.30 and 12.31 are big, and para 2 is small,
    there was a significant chance of someone not noticing para 2 while
    reading.  In fact para 2 seems to be technically wrong, so I added
    UTI 164.
  [455:1 16.5.2.1 General, para 1]
    Absolutely no way am I adding this junk here.  What was I thinking
    when I voted for this (I must have been asleep)?  It is in no sense
    "General" "Pointer association" stuff.  It's VOLATILE stuff guys,
    it only occurs *when the target is VOLATILE*, it belongs in the
    *VOLATILE* attribute subclause.  It belongs right next to the
    sentence saying "should have the VOLATILE attribute", so I have
    put it there.  That's another thing that needs review.
  Broke the now-huge paragraph 2 about VOLATILE into paras 2-4.
  Appended the last two paragraphs, which are about what VOLATILE means,
  rather than requirements, to the first paragraph which is also about
  semantics.  All these editorial things are IMO an obvious improvement,
  but they do need reviewing (many comments added to the new UTI 163).

  Deleted UTI 153.

132r1

133
  [411:29(14.8p2)] Singularised replacement and index definieiyt.
  Extra: Rewrote 14.11.1p1 to remove unnecessary complexity.
         Rewrote 14.11.1p2 to fix bug (it implied that IEEE_IS_FINITE
         should return true for an Infinity!) and remove unnecessary xref.
         Moved note 14.8 to the end of its subclause, changed "a call" to
           "an invocation" to match the wording in the actual restrictions
           better, and make more sense for functions.  Actually, the
           wording of this note is poor anyway.
  [14.10.2-14.10.6] Various minor wording improvements to some functions.

134r1
  Also fixed up many hyphens that were supposed to be minus signs.

135
  Removed existing Note under "association" re name association (not needed
  now it is properly defined).
  "statement entity" already existed, so I didn't add it.
  Indexed: deferred type parameter (was only partially done before).
  Added definition for "construct association".
  Hyperlinked "preconnected".

136 with alternative edit
  The bad page break turned out to be a bug in j3.cls (the macro \dcons).

137r2
  [156:19(7.2.1.3p3)] Changed first "<variable>" to "the variable",
    deleted "as <variable>" from the insertion (what else could it
    be the same as?).
  [268:25(10.11.2p3)] Followed the namelist comment suggestion.
    Also, lowercased "Comments" in the referenced subsection.
  [272:3,6(10.11.4.1p1)]
    Merged edit with that of a previous paper.

139
  [51:11+] Inserted subclause heading "General".
           Index the whole of the new subclause as the definition of
           "numeric type" (a defined term).

141
  Removed UTI 151.

142r2
  Removed reference to the deleted section in c01.
  Deleted UTI 155-158.
  I did not carefully recheck all the issues have been properly handled.

143r3
  [404:22-23]
    Only deleted two sentences, I couldn't find a third one to delete.

  Deleted UTI 161.

144

145s2
  "<default-char-initialization-expr>" was too long for our fixed space
    on the left-hand-side for BNF definitions; rather than increase this
    space, changed it to "<default-char-init-expr>".

145s3
  Did all this conditionally - switching between "constant expression"
    and "initialization expression" is a one-line change in 007.tex.
  With "constant expression", the hack for default-char-init-expr is no
    longer necessary, it becomes default-char-constant-expr.

146

147r2
  The edits in this paper were quite difficult to follow.
  Also fixed reference at [196:5] to be more specific.
  Put some of the statement lists into a semblance of alphabetic order.
  Indexed all of 8.5.7 for "STAT= specifier" and "ERRMSG= specifier".

  Deleted UTI 159.

  UTI 160 has not been entirely answered - the erroneous note has not been
    dealt with - so I have modified it instead of deleting it.

151
  Deleted UTI 152.

138r2
  [100-101: Notes in the middle of VOLATILE]
    Already done.
  [122:7-8]
    Also changed the definition in c01, using very different wording.
    Someone else should check it.
  [122:10-11]
    Also replaced nearby "whole array variable"->"whole array designator".
  [215:1+]
    Inserted the constraint at 35+ instead (the intervening constraints
      mostly applied to the earlier syntax rule, so this belongs later).
  [267:5]
    Added to the middle not the end of the paragraph, i.e. before the
      addition in another paper.
    Deleted "input/output" before "file positioning" (there ain't no other
      kind of file positioning operation).
  [294:3+(12.5.1 C1229+)]
    Used indefinite article instead of definite, for consistency with
      nearby text.
  [463:43-44]
     First "allocation"->"execution".
  [361:12] Reworded to improve typesetting.
