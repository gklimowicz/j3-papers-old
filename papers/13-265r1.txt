Discussion
----------

N1971 contains the comments submitted as part of votes on ballot N1968
for the initial draft of TS 18508 (N1967).  This paper contains
responses to the comments on the introductory parts of the TS not
covered in other papers: Introduction, Clauses 1-4, and corresponding
edits in Clause 8 where appropriate.


Edits to N1967:
---------------

   {David Muxworthy comment: The 'ISO_FORTRAN_ENV' module referenced
    at 3.2 and 3.3 is not the module from Fortran 2008.  At [5:3] add
    sentence "The intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is extended by this
    document."}

[5:3] After the first sentence of 3 Terms and definitions, add:

 "The intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is extended by this Technical
 Specification."


   {David Muxworthy comment: At 3.3 'team variable' should either
    follow 3.4 'team' or be subsumed under 'team'.}

[5:8-14] In the list of definitions in 3 Terms and definitions, move
the definitions of "event variable" and "team variable" to [5:35+]
following the definition of "team distance".

{This change will match the order in 8.3 where "event variable" and
"team variable" are located as subordinate to the "variable"
definition in F2008.}


   {David Muxworthy comment: Subclause 8.3 The items should be in
    numerical order.}

[25:30-26:3] In the list of definitions in 8.3 Edits to clause 1, move
the definitions of "event variable" and "team variable" to [26:24+]
following the definition of "team distance".


Responses not resulting in edits:
---------------------------------

   {David Muxworthy comment: Subclause 2
    At [3:5+] add:
    ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010/Cor 1:2012
    ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010/Cor 2:2013}

Reply: Similar text was not included in TS 29113 which was approved by
ISO. Further, none of the edits in Clause 8 refer to these documents,
so they are not really "indispensable" for the application of the TS.


   {David Muxworthy comment: Subclause 4 [7:8] Replace "This" by
    "Except as identified in 4.1 above, this".}

Reply: The current text appears in TS 29113 and also in the base F2008
standard (1.6.2) following the same discussion about new intrinsic
procedures. There seems to be precedent, approved by ISO, for not
including this qualifying text.
