Subject: STAT= wording clarification for ALLOCATE

Discussion
----------

The first sentence of 9.7.4, para 3, begins "If an ALLOCATE or
DEALLOCATE statement with a coarray <allocate-object> is executed when
one or more images of the current team has initiated normal
termination of execution, the <stat-variable> becomes defined..."
This is only the case if a STAT= specifier appears. What happens if
one does not appear is a bit far away in 9.7.3.1p3.  It would be
clearer here to give <stat-variable> context by saying that a STAT=
appears.

The last sentence of the same paragraph begins "In any case...". But
the case of STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is already specified by the second
sentence of the paragraph (the <allocate-object>s are allocated on the
active images of the current team). So this case should be excluded
from the "any case".

--------------


[147:1] In 9.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, sentence 1, after "If an
ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement with" add "a STAT= specifier and".


[147:9-10] In 9.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, final sentence, change
". In any case," to "If any error condition other than the detection
of a failed image occurs,"
