Subject: Editorial enhancements for future revisions

This is the editor's list of things which have been and are being
considered for future Draft revisions.

The edits in Section A have been applied to the LaTeX sources and
are included in the 007.  The edits in Section B have not been applied
to the LaTeX sources.  Both of these sections are by reference to
10-007r1, and will be closed when revision of the standard begins.

Section B includes the edits resulting from Corrigendum 1.  The editor
will make additional changes to these, noted with "{{COMMENT".

Sections C to E will become progressively smaller; suggestions that
are implemented will be removed from this document.

  Change "This" to "Except as identified in this subclause, this",
  Change "Any" to "Except as identified in this subclause, any",
  Insert six new paragraphs
    "Fortran 2003 permitted a sequence type to have type parameters; that
     is not permitted by this part of ISO/IEC 1539.

     Fortran 2003 specified that array constructors and structure
     constructors of finalizable type are finalized.  This part of ISO/IEC
     1539 specifies that these constructors are not finalized.

     The form produced by the G edit descriptor for some values and some
     I/O rounding modes differs from that specified by Fortran 2003.

     Fortran 2003 required an explicit interface only for a procedure that
     was actually referenced in the scope, not merely passed as an actual
     argument.  This part of ISO/IEC 1539 requires an explicit interface
     for a procedure under the conditions listed in 12.4.2.2, regardless of
     whether the procedure is referenced in the scope.

     Fortran 2003 permitted the result variable of a pure function to be a
     polymorphic allocatable variable, or to be finalizable by an impure
     final subroutine.  These are not permitted by this part of ISO/IEC
     1539.

     Fortran 2003 permitted an INTENT(OUT) argument of a pure subroutine to
     be polymorphic; that is not permitted by this part of ISO/IEC 1539.".

C. Edits under consideration
----------------------------

[c14] Investigate reorganisation of the IEEE module descriptions to
      make it easier to find and understand the non-procedure
      entities (including rewriting 14.9p1).
{Deferred to WG5 decision.}

				
D. Rationale for accepted edits
-------------------------------

None.


E. For future consideration
---------------------------

(1) [36:4] 2.4.3.3 change "rank" to "shape".
Discussion:
    7.1.9 claims to specify the "Type, type parameters, and shape of an
    expression", but a disassociated pointer (this is an acceptable result
    of an expression in some contexts) has rank but no shape.  2.4.3.3 is
    probably ok as is, but 7.1.9 looks dubious.

(2) [441:17-20 16.3.3] Delete subclause 16.3.3.
Discussion:
    This is because it duplicates 12.6.2.2p4 [307:13-21].


F. Rejected suggestions.
------------------------

[133:8] 7.1.1p3, make wording more like 2.4.3.3,
   After "Evaluation of an expression produces a "
   Change "value, which has"
   To "data entity.  The data entity has"
Answer:
   Use of the term "data entity", which can refer to practically anything,
   instead of the term "value", would be unnatural and lose specificity.
{10-214}

(2) [36:7] 2.4.3.4 change "rank" to "shape".
Answer:
    The shape of a function result is not necessarily determined by the
    interface of the function, so this change would be incorrect.
