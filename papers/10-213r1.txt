STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


Consider the following code:

module m
  implicit none
  private
  public :: foo                       ! A
  type, private :: foo                ! B
    integer :: i = 0
  end type
  type(foo), public :: o_foo
  interface foo
    module procedure foo_proc
  end interface
contains
  function foo_proc(i) result(this)
    integer, intent(in) :: i
    type(foo) :: this
    this%i = i
    write(*, *) 'Hello'
  end function
end module m
program p
  use m
  implicit none
  o_foo = foo(2)
end program

QUESTION:

Is this program standard conforming?

ANSWER:

No.

DISCUSSION:

The PUBLIC statement at A contradicts the PRIVATE attribute at B which
violates the standard.
