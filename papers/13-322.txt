Straw Vote:

If common blocks are obsolescent, arguably, so are
block data subprograms.  Does obsolescenting
commons also obsolescent block data?  Y/N/U

There is one dependency below on this question.
It is marked with ***

There are a lot of edits here.  I choose to include
articles and conjunctions, and to exclude prepositions.
This choice might be wrong.

Specification: common blocks and equivalence statements are
obsolescent.

Syntax: no change, just obsolescence
