Discussion

The relaxed rules for segment ordering concerning referencing of
VOLATILE scalars is meant to facilitate certain low-level but common
constructions (like spin loops).  We agree with editor's arguments
that scalar elements and components should be treated the same as
simple scalars.

While reviewing the terminology used in this section we noticed that
the first bullet point does not adequately cover non-co-array TARGETs
accessed by other images via pointer components of co-arrays.

Edits to J3/07-007r2

[212:4] In 8.5.1 Image control statements, paragraph 6, line 4,
replace "co-array" by "variable".
