Subject: Interpretation request on procedure pointers


NUMBER: TBD
TITLE:  Procedure pointers and the EXTERNAL attribute
KEYWORDS: Procedure pointers, EXTERNAL
DEFECT TYPE: Error
STATUS:
QUESTION:

Is the following program unit standard conforming?

  SUBROUTINE SUB ( RPP )
    REAL, EXTERNAL, POINTER :: RPP
    EXTERNAL, POINTER :: PP
    PROCEDURE(REAL), POINTER :: PPP => NULL()
  END SUBROUTINE SUB

The last sentence of "5.1.2.6 EXTERNAL attribute" appears to indicate that
it is allowed:

"A procedure that has both the EXTERNAL and POINTER attributes is a
procedure pointer."

That the title of subclause 12.2.1.2 is "Characteristics of dummy
procedures and dummy procedure pointers" suggests that it is allowed. 
That subclause continues "... whether it is a pointer, ..." so it was
clearly envisioned that at least dummy procedures could have the POINTER
attribute. 

C1216 appears to require PPP to be allowed:

"C1216 (R1214) If => appears in <proc-decl>, the procedure entity shall
       have the pointer attribute."

On the other hand, C512 appears to prohibit RPP and PP:

"C512 (R501) If the POINTER attribute is specified, the ALLOCATABLE,
      TARGET, EXTERNAL, or INTRINSIC attribute shall not be specified."

and a conspiracy of C512, the second sentence of subclause 5.1.2.6

"This [EXTERNAL] attribute may also be specified by ... a
<procedure-declaration-stmt>..."

and the first paragraph of subclause 5.2

"The combination of attributes that may be specified for a particular
entity is subject to the same restrictions ... regardless of the method of
specification.  This also applies to the PROCEDURE, EXTERNAL and INTRINSIC
statements."

appears to prohibit PPP.

ANSWER:

The program unit is standard conforming.  It was an oversight that the
EXTERNAL attribute was not removed from C512 during the development of
the procedure pointer facility.  It is not helpful that the last sentence
of the first paragraph of subclause 5.2 refers to "PROCEDURE ...
statements" where it should refer to "procedure declaration ...
statements."

EDIT:

Delete ", EXTERNAL" from C512.

Replace the last sentence of the first paragraph of subclause 5.2 by "This
also applies to procedure declaration statements, and to EXTERNAL and
INTRINSIC statements."
