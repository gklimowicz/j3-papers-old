NUMBER:  F03/0035
TITLE:  IEEE_NEXT_AFTER()
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, nextafter()
DEFECT TYPE:  ???
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

What is NEXT_AFTER(+0.0,-0.0)?  NEXT_AFTER(-0.0,+0.0)?

What is NEXT_AFTER(X,Y) if X and/or Y is NaN?

DISCUSSION:

C99 and IEEE-754R (the revision of IEEE-754 now in progress)
define NEXT_AFTER(X,Y) as Y (not X) when X == Y.

NEXT_AFTER(X,Y) when both X and Y are NaN shall be a NaN, and
should be one of NaN arguments.

NEXT_AFTER(X,Y) when one of X and Y is a NaN shall be a NaN, and
should the NaN argument.
