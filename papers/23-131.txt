Subject: Fortran vulnerabilities liason report
Date: 2023-February-21


John Reid, Steve Lionel, and myself continue to meet biweekly with
Stephen Michell and Erhard Ploedereder of WG23ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC22/WG 23
(Programming Language Vulnerabilities) to produce a technical report
on vulnerabilities.

A first pass through the document has been completed with substantial
changes. 

Again, special thanks to John Reid for spending considerable
time preparing edits between meetings.
