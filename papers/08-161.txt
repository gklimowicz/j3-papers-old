Discussion:

When we changed "derived type input/output" to "defined input/output"
we kept the syntax term <dtio-generic-spec>.  This results in somewhat
odd wording, as for example, in [279:p5].  Should we change the syntax
term to get rid of the "derived type" abbreviation?

In comments for the first draft of the CD, I suggested

<dio-generic-spec>.

The editor did not like this choice (what does the "d" stand for?),
but suggested alternatives he thought were better:

<io-generic-spec>
<defined-io-generic-spec>.


Edits to J3/08-007r2 (WG5/N1723):

Replace <dtio-generic-spec> with <defined-io-generic-spec> globally.
