QUESTION:

Is the name of a procedure pointer a local identifier?

The list of classes of local identifiers given in paragraph 1
of subclause 16.3.1 of J3/10-007r1 (page 440) does not include
procedure pointers.

ANSWER:

Yes, if a procedure pointer is named, the name of the procedure
pointer is a local identifier.  An edit is provided to emend
the oversight.

EDITS:

[440:4, 16.3.1p1] Replace
 "named constants, named"
with
 "named constants, named procedure pointers, named".
