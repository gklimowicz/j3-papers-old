With large modules with many names, perhaps long names, it
may be difficult, unclear or inconvenient to use most of the names
present while excluding a few (perhaps to prevent collisions).
Adding a EXCEPT clause to the USE statement solves the problem.

This feature is proposed in response to an informal Fortran 2003
comment from Australia (no formal comment was received).
The spelling is changed from NOT to EXCEPT in response
to a suggestion received.

At M167 the Hate .. Love vote was 1 - 1 - 8 - 2.
The difficulty on the John Reid scale was 4.

Title: USE EXCEPT:

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

Basic Functionality: A syntax to list names not to have use association
                     when using a module.

Rationale:  When using a module with many public names, a few may be
            unwanted.  Specifying those few is easier than naming
            the many wanted names, and less ugly than fanciful renames.

Estimated Impact: 4 on the John Reid scale at 167

Detailed Specification: Add a clause to the USE statement
                        specifying names not available via use association.

                        If EXCEPT: <list> is present, ONLY is not, and
                        there are no renames (in the <list>).  (It makes no
                        sense to say "don't use this name, and call it 'foo'".)

                        When the same module name appears in several use
                        statements, if any have an ONLY clause, none
                        may have an EXCEPT clause, if any have an EXCEPT
                        clause, none may have an ONLY clause.

                        If a name appears in an <except-list>, it may not
                        be the <use_name> in a <rename>.

                        Note that the edits are proposed to illustrate
                        the degree of difficulty of modifying the standard,
                        and to provide an example of the edits the above
                        specifications might require.
