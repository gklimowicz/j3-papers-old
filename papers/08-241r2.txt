Commenter: Robert Corbett
Subject: "definition is poorly defined"

Consider the program:

       PROGRAM MAIN
         TYPE T1
           SEQUENCE
           INTEGER I, J
         END TYPE
         TYPE T2
           SEQUENCE
           INTEGER I, J
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T1) X, Y
         EQUIVALENCE (I, X, Y)
         X%J = 2
         I = 1
         PRINT *, I, X, Y
       END

The assignment to the variable I causes I, X, and Y
to become defined (see items (1) and (15) of
Section 16.6.5).  Therefore, according to item (1)
of Section 16.6.6, I, X, and Y become undefined.

Item (1) of Section 16.6.6 should be modified so that
it directly applies only to ultimate components.  The
effect on aggregate types will then occur as is
appropriate because of the rules given in
Section 16.6.1.

J3 response:

Subclause 16.6.6 item (1) of the Fortran 2003 standard, and subclause
14.7.6 item (1) of the Fortran 95 standard, both specify the same
behavior.


This comment raises questions that deserve deeper consideration than
J3 can give them at this time.  J3 has internally generated an
interpretation request.
