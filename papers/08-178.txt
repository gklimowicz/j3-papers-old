[277: 12.4.3.2 C1207] --------------------------------------------------

Given that the following is allowed

  subroutine A
    interface B
      procedure P
    end interface B
    procedure(I), pointer :: P
    P => I
    call B
  contains
    subroutine I
    end subroutine I
  end subroutine A

what's the point of excluding internal procedures in C1207?

Wouldn't this be simpler?

  subroutine A
    interface B
      procedure I
    end interface B
    call B
  contains
    subroutine I
    end subroutine I
  end subroutine A

Editor: Replace C1207:

"C1207 (R1206) A <procedure-name> shall be a nonintrinsic procedure that
has an explicit interface."
