PL22.3 Programming Language Fortran Task Group

March 2, 2021

InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS)
Secretariat: Information Technology Industry Council (ITI)
1101 K Street NW, Suite 610, Washington, DC 20005

Dear INCITS Secretariat:

The PL22.3 Task Group would like to recommend Dan Nagle for consideration
of Emeritus Member.

Dan joined the Committee in June 1999 at a joint X3J3/WG5 meeting and was a
contributing member throughout his membership. Dan represented the National
Center for Atmospheric Research on PL22.3 and retired from there on October
22, 2020. His last PL22.3 meeting was October 2019.

Dan served as Committee Chairman from September 2001 until October 2019.
During that time, he kept account of the work items for each meeting,
served as liaison to the Marriott corporation for meeting room
reservations, and also applied his deep knowledge of Fortran and Fortran
programming toward the improvements in the language from Fortran 2003 and
later. In 2017 Dan took over the chairmanship of the JOR (Journal of
Requirements) subcommittee, which is tasked to organize, investigate, and
vote on new features for new versions of the Fortran standard.

Please consider Dan Nagle for Emeritus Member status in the PL22.3
Programming Language Fortran Task Group.

Sincerely,

Brian Friesen
Chair, PL22.3
