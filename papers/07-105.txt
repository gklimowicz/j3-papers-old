TITLE: Entry names as dummy procedure arguments
KEYWORDS: Entry names, dummy procedure arguments
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Does the following subprogram fragment conflict with the 2003 Fortran
standard?  If so, was the conflict intended?

  entry A ( X )
    interface
      subroutine X ( A )
        abstract interface
          subroutine I ( ... )
          ...
          end subroutine I
        end interface
        procedure (I) A
      end subroutine X
    end interface
  ...

It seems that constraint C1255 in subclause 12.5.2.4 [283:10-12] prohibits
the entry name A to appear in the PROCEDURE statement in the interface
body.  There shouldn't be a problem, however, since the PROCEDURE
statement is in a different scoping unit.

REMARK:

There is no constraint parallel to C1255 concerning the <subroutine-name>
in a SUBROUTINE statement, and only an indirect one (C1235 in subclause
12.5.2.1 [279:24-25]) concerning the <function-name> in a FUNCTION
statement, and only then if the FUNCTION statement has a RESULT clause.
Subclauses 16.1 and 16.2 adequately cover the problems that constraint
C1255 appears to have been intended to cover.

ANSWER:

It was not intended that this usage be prohibited.  An edit is provided to
remove the prohibition.

EDITS:

Within constraint C1255 in subclause 12.5.2.4, insert "the scoping unit
of" after "Within".

or

Delete constraint C1255.
