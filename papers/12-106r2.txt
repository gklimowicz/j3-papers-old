NUMBER: F08/0066
TITLE: Are certain expressions with pointer initialization constant?
KEYWORDS: constant, pointer initialization
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Under J3 consideration

QUESTION:

Given

    type :: T
      character(len=:), pointer :: P
    end type T
    character(len=10), target, save :: V

(1) Is the expression T(V) a constant expression?

If so, consider the additional statement

  TYPE(T),PARAMETER :: Z = T(V)

(2) Is the expression
      TRANSFER(SQRT(TRANSFER(Z,R)),Z)
    a constant expression?

(3) Is the expression Z%P a constant expression?

(4) Is the assignment
      Z%P = 'NEW VALUE'
    a valid assignment?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes.

(2) An expression involving TRANSFER of an initialization target was
    not intended to be classified as a constant expression.  An edit
    is provided to correct this.

(3) Except in pointer association context, no (see 6.4.2p5).

(4) Yes.  In this context, Z%P is not a subobject of Z.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[152:4] 7.1.12 "Constant expression", p1, item (6),
	After "THIS_IMAGE" insert ", TRANSFER".
{Exclude the general case of TRANSFER from constant expressions.}

[152:7+] After item (7) "... NULL ...", insert new item
  "(7a) A reference to the intrinsic function TRANSFER where each
        argument is a constant expression and the SOURCE argument does
	not have an ultimate pointer component whose value was given
	by an initialization target."
{Exclude the problematic case without introducing an incompatibility
 with Fortran 95.}
