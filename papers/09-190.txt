Discussion:

UTI 160 (page 196) points out that Note 8.44 is defective. The first
sentence refers to the requirement that detecting a stopped image is
required, but ignores all the new error conditions associated with
locks whose detection is required.  The UTI also suggests that the
processor dependent statement be normative and added in Annex A.


Edits are supplied to correct these issues.

------------

Edit to 09-007r1:

[196:26+] Following para 5 of 8.5.7 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers on
image control statements, add a new paragraph:

"The processor may detect error conditions in addition to those
specified in this subclause. Which error conditions, if any, are
detected is processor dependent"


[196:Note 8.44] Replace all of the body of Note 8.44 with:

"The processor might test for network time-outs. While the overall
program would probably not be able to recover from a synchronization
error, the processor could perhaps provide information on what failed
and be able to save some of the program state to a file. The processor
might check that a valid set of images has been provided in a SYNC
IMAGES statement, with no out-of-range or repeated values."


[464:21+] In the list of things processor dependent in Annex A, add:

"\bullet which additional error conditions are detected during
execution of an image control control statement with a STAT= specifier
(8.5.7);"
