This is mostly typos and similar, perhaps this paper can be passed
directly to the Editor.

Edits:

{remove redundant statement see [52:4]}

[52:9] delete "A derived type can have type parameters"

{a derived type might not have type parameters}

[53:33] after "...and its type parameter values"
add ", if any"

{type(*) can appear in the selector in a select type construct}

[54:12] after "assumed-type"
add "or in a selector in a SELECT TYPE construct"

{no more arithmetic if}

[57:1-] In Note 4.7, replace "IF (X) 1,2,3"
by "IF( X==0.0 ) GO TO 2"
and fix the font to regular feature font.

{what is the "effective argument" of an ALLOCATE statement?}

[60:28-29]

{what is Note 4.21 supposed to say?}

[66-67:1-]

[74:3] change "(where" to "(if"

{Note 4.40 - only if the USE statement doesn't rename or
 exclude the type name via a only clause}

before "Such a type definition"
and change "the module via a USE statement"
to "the type name via a USE statement for the module"
