Subject:    Question without edits concerning collective subroutines

1. Question:

16.6p1 says a collective subroutine shall be invoked by the same
statement on all active images of the current team.  If it's invoked
from a recursive procedure, does it matter from which instance it is
invoked on different images?  This should be made clear, one way or
another, even if only in a note.

2. Response:

The answer to the question is NO.  The instance should not matter.
All that matters is that the same collective subroutine must be
invoked in the same sequence by all active images of the current team.
This normative text already has this [345:17-18] 16.6p2: "... the
sequence of invocations of collective subroutines shall be the same on
all active images of a team."

The existing wording already covers a situation where different active
images of a team invoke a collective subroutine by the same statement
in different iterations of a recursive procedure.  Consider a team of
4 images: 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Odd images of this team invoke a collective
subroutine in instances 1 and 3 of a recursive procedure, and even
images of the same team invoke the same collective subroutine by the
same statement in instances 2 and 4 of a recursive procedure.  In this
case the sequence of invocations of collective subroutine is the same
on all active images of a team. So is a conforming behaviour.

We conclude that no edit is needed to the normative text and no note
is needed.
