0.  This is 292 as updated by discussion in /jor.

1. Introduction

A number of intrinsic procedures have a Description that is much more
detailed than necessary, containing information that really belongs in the
Result Value paragraph.  At best this wastes space and makes the standard
harder to read, at worst it risks questions of interpretation when the
Description and Result Value don't agree.

These should be simplified.


2. Additional edits

We have a whole subclause wittering on about MASK= arguments, but we don't
have anything for DIM arguments.  Here is a suggestion, arising from the
consideration that I informally used "reduce" in the suggestions above
without describing what that meant.

[314:13.3-]
"13.2.4 Dim arguments and reduction functions

 Some array intrinsic functions are ``reduction'' functions; that is, they
 reduce the rank of an array by collapsing one dimension (or all
 dimensions, usually producing a scalar result).  These functions have an
 optional DIM argument that, if present, specifies the dimension to be
 reduced.  The DIM argument of a reduction function is not permitted to be
 an optional dummy argument.

 The process of reducing a dimension usually combines the selected
 elements with a simple operation such as addition or an intrinsic function
 such as MAX, but more sophisticated reductions are also provided, e.g. by
 COUNT and MAXLOC."


3. Edits

The descriptions that should be changed appear both in Table 13.1 and in
the Description paragraph of each intrinsic.  This paper lists the current
description and the proposed change.  If not stated, the reason is that the
description in unnecessarily long; other reasons are given with "Comment:"
