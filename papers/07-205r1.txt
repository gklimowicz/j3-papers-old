The first part of NOTE 9.4 should be normative. 


Edits to J3/07-007r1

[208:24] In 9.2 External file, remove the first two sentences of NOTE
9.4 and add the following two sentences at the end of paragraph 3.

"A named file that is opened with the TEAM= specifier (9.4.5.17) has
the same name on each image of the team. Apart from this, whether a
named file on one image is the same as a file with the same name on
another image is processor dependent."
