NUMBER: Fxx/xxx
TITLE: Real argument I in IEEE_SCALB
KEYWORDS: Real, IEEE_SCALB
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress
REFERENCES: N2213 (FDIS)

QUESTION:
The first sentence of 17.1 Overview of IEEE arithmetic support, states:
"The intrinsic modules IEEE_EXCEPTIONS, IEEE_ARITHMETIC, and 
IEEE_FEATURES provide support for the facilities defined by 
ISO/IEC 60559:2020." but IEEE_SCALB (X,I) does not support real values
for the argument I. Was this was an oversight?


ANSWER:
Yes. The function scaleB in the IEEE standard supports real values
for its second argument. An edit is supplied. 

The same oversight was made in Fortran 2018, in 17.11.33, and should 
have been corrected in an interpretation. Because the change is being 
made now, it should be recorded as a difference from Fortran 2018. 
An edit is supplied. 


EDITS to N2213:
In Introduction, Intrinsic modules bullet item. Add at the end
"The function IEEE_SCALB(X,I) from the intrinsic module IEEE_ARITHMETIC 
now permits the argument I to have type real."

In 17.11.37 IEEE_SCALB (X, I), Arguments, I, change "integer" to 
"integer or real with the same kind type parameter as X" 
so that the line reads 
"I shall be of type integer or real with the same kind type parameter 
as X."
