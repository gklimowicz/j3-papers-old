Discussion
----------

In his recent ballot (see N2045) Reinhold Bader remarked that NOTE 4.48
of Fortran 2008 needs to be reworded now that the term "event" has a
defined meaning that has nothing to do with the NOTEs scenario.

Edit to N2040:
---------------

[35:24-25] Replace by
"{In 4.5.6.2 The finalization process, edit NOTE 4.48 as follows}

An implementation might need to ensure that when \uwave{the execution
of a statement} causes more than one coarray to be deallocated, they
are deallocated in the same order on all images \uwave{in the current
team}."
