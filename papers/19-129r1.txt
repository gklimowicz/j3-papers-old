NUMBER: F18/004
TITLE: Program execution sequence with failed images
KEYWORDS: Program execution, Termination of execution, Failed image, 
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider execution of a program with more than one image, and some
image has failed (perhaps by execution of FAIL IMAGE, or perhaps by
some actual failure).  Let us further suppose that all other images
have initiated normal termination.

According to 5.3.7 "Termination of execution", paragraph 1:
    "Termination of execution of the program occurs
     when all images have terminated execution."
This text is unchanged from Fortran 2008, which did not have failed
images.

As an image that has failed "has ceased participating in program
execution but has not terminated execution", it would seem that in
this situation, execution of the program has not terminated.

Should failed images cause execution of the program not to terminate?

ANSWER:

No, failed images have stopped participating in program execution and
therefore their existence should not prevent program termination.
That this definition is unchanged from Fortran 2008 is an oversight.

An edit is supplied to correct this.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[38:8] 5.3.7 Termination of execution, p1,
       After "when all images have"
       insert "failed or",
       making the last sentence of the paragraph read
  "Termination of execution of the program occurs when all images
   have terminated execution or failed."
