Subject: Annex D considered harmful
Date: 2014 June 09


1. Discussion

Annex D takes 64 pages, and is largely redundant where correct and
occasionally incorrect where it is not entirely redundant.

D.1 (49 pages) is simply a copy of all the syntax rules and constraints,
i.e. it is entirely duplicative.  But is fragile, since constraints with
embedded lists need to have the list duplicated: once for the actual
normative constraint, once for this annex.  I am pretty sure that no
mistakes have been made so far, but it would be pretty easy to make one.

D.2 (14 pages) is the cross-reference.  This is automatically generated
with a Perl script.  However, it cannot handle constraints with numbers
greater than 99, thus we see that e.g. R204 is referenced by C1305
(actually C12105) and R727 is referenced by C1306 (actually C12106).

Unfortunately it is unclear just exactly what is wrong with BNFxref.pl,
assuming that is where the problem actually lies; the problem could lie in
j3.cls instead but if so it is hard to see what is wrong.

One might consider that the one redeeming feature of D.2 is that it allows
us to see easily when there is a BNF rule that is not referenced anywhere.
But this does not seem to be adequate justification for burning 64 pages
every time.

Finally, it is definitely unacceptable to ship an incorrect Annex D, and
burdensome even to attempt to fix it.  Deleting it solves the problem.


2. Edits to 14-007r1

[xix] Introduction, p4,
      Delete line "Syntax rules       Annex D".
{The only place we refer to it.}

[565-628] Delete entirety of Annex D.


3. Postscript

If there is actual demand for the contents of Annex D, we could certainly
continue to publish it as a separate document, e.g. as a WG5 document,
together with a "health warning" of its inaccuracies.  (Or we could maybe
fix them manually given this would be post-publication.)
