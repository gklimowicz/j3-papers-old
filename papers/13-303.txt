Subject: For editorial consideration concerning "nonpointer function"
Date: 2013 August 13
Reference: WG5/N1987, interpretation F08/0089

1. The problem
--------------

The term "pointer function" is not used as a noun, and "nonpointer
function" is used as a noun only once.  It ought to be "function whose
result is not a pointer."

Interpretation F08/0089, if passed as in N1987, would introduce the term
"pointer function".  If it passes without amendment, either the text
revised by that interpretation ought also to be further revised so as
not to use the term "pointer function", or the edit here ought not to be
applied.

2. Edits
--------

[12-007:16.6.5p1(25) 454:36] Replace "nonpointer function" with
"function whose result is not a pointer".
