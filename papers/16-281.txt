~~~~~~~~~~~

The specification of the ordering properties of SYNC MEMORY described in
11.6.5 SYNC MEMORY statement, para 2 appear to be in contradiction to
the explanatory text for the atomic subroutines appearing in Appendix
C.12.2.2, in particular [596:21-25]. This seems to be related to at least
a subset of the hen-and-egg problems brought up by Nick Maclaren.
Edits are provided below based on the conclusion that atomic references
and definitions should be excepted from the general ordering properties.


Suggested edits:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[209:6] and [210:3]:
  replace "defined, referenced" by "nonatomically defined, nonatomically
  referenced", twice.


[210:6+]: Add sentence
  "If P is the same image as Q, atomic definitions or references to
   X before the SYNC MEMORY precede atomic definitions or references to
   Y after the SYNC MEMORY statement."

{this appears to be necessary to continue ensuring that such defs and
 refs are not moved across the SYNC MEMORY by the optimizer}.
