3. Edits to N2123 (17-007r1)

[17.03 450:2-3] The exceptions
    Replace "relational operation"
    with "intrinsic equality or inequality operation between x_1 and
    x_2", so that the entire sentence now reads:

    "In a scoping unit that has access to IEEE_EXCEPTIONS or
     IEEE_ARITHMETIC, if x_1 or x_2 are numeric entities, the type of
     x_1 + x_2 is complex, and IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN (REAL (x_1 + x_2)) is
     true, the intrinsic equality or inequality operation between x_1
     and x_2 may signal IEEE_INVALID if the value of the real or
     imaginary part of either operand is a signaling NaN."
{GB-035.}

[17.11.17 462:15-16+] IEEE_MAX_NUM (X, Y)
    Delete bullet 4 "if both X and Y are quiet...",
    after "the result is a NaN" change "." to ";",
    add new final bullet:
    "otherwise, the result is either X or Y (processor dependent)."
{GB-036.}

[17.11.18 462:32-34]: IEEE_MAX_NUM_MAG (X, Y)
      Replace the last three bullets with the bullet:
      "otherwise, the result has the value of IEEE_MAX_NUM (X, Y)."
{GB-037.}

[17.11.19 463:14-15+] IEEE_MIN_NUM (X, Y)
    Delete bullet 4 "if both X and Y are quiet...",
    after "the result is a NaN" change "." to ";",
    add new final bullet:
    "otherwise, the result is either X or Y (processor dependent)."
{GB-039.}

[17.11.20 463:31-33] IEEE_MIN_NUM_MAG (X, Y)
    Replace the last three bullets with the bullet:
    "otherwise, the result has the value of IEEE_MIN_NUM (X, Y)."
{GB-040.}

[A.2 540:23-24] Processor Dependencies
     after "are quiet NaNs"
     insert "or are zeros"
{GB-036,GB-037,GB-039,GB-040.}
