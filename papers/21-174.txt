Discussion
----------

I think I have found some minor glitches associated with US 09. 

For both procedures, I think we should say that the result is a scalar. 
In the first example C_F_STRPOINTER there is a typo "C_chr". In
both examples for C_F_STRPOINTER, the intent(out) variable is 
allocatable instead of being a pointer.

-----------------
[501:14] In 18.2.3.5 C_F_STRPOINTER, para 3, FSTRPTR, sentence 1.
Add "scalar" before "deferred-length" to make the sentence read 
"FSTRPTR shall be a scalar deferred-length character pointer of 
kind C_CHAR."

[501:31] In 18.2.3.5 C_F_STRPOINTER, para 5, Case(i), line 4 of the 
code. Change "C_chr" to "C_char" and "allocatable" to "Pointer" 
to make the line read 
   "Character (:, C_char), Pointer :: sval"

[502:1] In 18.2.3.5 C_F_STRPOINTER, para 5, Case(ii), line 3 of the 
code. Change "allocatable" to "Pointer" 
to make the line read 
   "Character (:, C_char), Pointer :: evalue"
   
[504:23] In 18.2.3.9 F_C_STRING, para 4, sentence 1.
Add "a scalar" before "of type character" to make the sentence read 
"The result is a scalar of type character with the same kind type 
parameter as STRING."
