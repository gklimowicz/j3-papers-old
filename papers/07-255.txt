Discussion

NOTE 8.33 says that there may be a need for a SYNC ALL statement
before the first executable statement of the main program. The editor
takes the view that this is not necessary since the standard says that
an initialized variable is initially defined (that is, before its own
image or any other image accesses it). To remove any doubt in the
reader's mind, we think it would be better to say explicitly that
synchronization of all the images occurs before execution of the first
executable statement of the main program. In simple cases that do not
need it, the compiler could optimize the synchronization away.


Edits to 07-007r2:

[27:1] In 2.4.5 Execution sequence, at the end of the first sentence,
add "and synchronizing them all".

[213:18+] In 8.5.2 SYNC ALL statement, delete NOTE 8.33.
