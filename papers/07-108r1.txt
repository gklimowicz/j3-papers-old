Subject: Constraintifying subclause 12.4.3.3.4
Date: 15 February 2007

Subclause 12.4.3.4.5 was moved from clause 16 to clause 12 by 06-193r1. 
Processors are required to report violations of provisions in clause 16 in
the same way as they are required to report violations of constraints. 
Conversion of the ordinary normative text to constraints was postponed
when the subclause was moved.
