Subject: "types declared to be PRIVATE"

When the standard speaks of a type declared to be
PRIVATE, it means a type declared to be PRIVATE in
the scoping unit in which the type definition that
declared that type appeared.  The standard should
say that somewhere.

For example, in the program

       MODULE MOD1
         TYPE T
           INTEGER :: I
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T) :: X
       END

       MODULE MOD2
         USE MOD1
         PRIVATE T
         TYPE(T) :: Y
       END

       PROGRAM MAIN
         USE MOD2
         Y%I = 12
         X = Y
       END

The type T in module MOD2 is not considered a type
declared to be PRIVATE, and so there is no conflict
between the first and last sentences of the second
paragraph in Section 4.5.2.4 of the standard.

J3 response:

The commenter's observation that there is no conflict in this example
is correct.

The final sentence of 4.5.2.4p2 is not germane since the SEQUENCE
attribute does not appear.

If SEQUENCE had been specified, there would be deeper questions that
deserve more significant consideration than can be given to them at
this time.  J3 has internally generated an interpretation request.
