The IEEE floating-point working group has held no meetings
since the new edition of the standard was approved.

The working group held an e-mail ballot on whether to ask the
IEEE Microprocessor Standards Committee (MSC) to pass the new
edition of IEEE 754 up to the ISO.  The vote was 26-0 in favor,
which acting chair David Hough ruled to be consensus.  The MSC
should consider what it wants to do in its October meeting.

The positions of chair and secretary of the working group
remain open.

Krste Asanovic of the Berkeley RISC V project asked about
adding bfloat16 to RISC V.  James Demmel raised the prospect
of reactivating the working group to consider bfloat16.

Jason Riedy maintains the bug list for IEEE 754-2019 and
feature requests for the next edition of the standard.  He
