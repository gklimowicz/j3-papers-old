From:     Mallory North, J3 Librarian
Subject:  Guidelines for Submitting J3 Papers

Ref: J3/96-140r1, J3/05-102r2

In 1996 The ANSI Fortran Technical Committee J3 moved to go "total electronic"
in terms of pre-meeting distribution, post-meeting distribution, minutes,
and announcements (see the referenced paper).  The purpose was to minimize or
eliminate costs associated with hard copy reproduction and mailing.  All
documents at that time were made available via anonymous ftp from a server
maintained by Kurt Hirchert at the University of Illinois.

Since that time, changes in information technology and publishing software
motivates this revision to the guidelines for submitting J3 papers.
The following guidelines for submitting papers for consideration by J3 were
discussed and approved by J3 at Meeting 170, November 8 - 12, 2004 in Las Vegas,
Nevada.  The intent is that these guidelines be distributed electronically to
all principal members, alternates, observers, liaisons, and correspondents,
and implemented immediately.  Note that the guidelines are similar to those
of WG5 so as to maximize compatibility and familiarity with electronic
document handling and distribution for both organizations.

1.  Who may submit.

    Any member of J3, or any non-member who is interested in contribut-
    ing to the development and standardization of the Fortran scientific
    computing language may submit a paper to J3 for consideration.

2.  When to submit.

    J3 requires that papers that are to be considered at a duly scheduled
    meeting of the Committee be submitted to the Librarian at least two
    weeks prior to the meeting.  Papers submitted after this time will be
    considered by the Committee as time and work load permit, as long as
    there is no objection to considering such a "late paper".

3.  Procedure for submitting a paper to J3.

    a. The document will be prepared in an electronic format using either
       an ASCII character text file (e.g. extension .txt) or a Portable
       Document Format file (e.g. extension .pdf) or Postscript (e.g. 
       extension .ps).  The preferred form is pure ASCII character form,
       especially for rather short papers that have no graphics and few
       formatting changes.  It is recognized that some papers that are
       long, or contain graphics, or contain several formatting changes
       are more appropriately formatted in PostScript or Portable
       Document Format or other formats.  Papers submitted in one of
       the prescribed formats may also, if desired, be submitted in
       other formats for inclusion on the server (e.g., .tex, .doc,
       .wpd, .rtf, etc.).

    b. Before submitting the document to J3, the submitter should
       request a paper number from the J3 Librarian via email at
       (north@rose-hulman.edu).  The Librarian will assign a number of
       the form J3/yy-nnnrm where yy stands for the year, nnn stands
       for the paper sequence number, and rm stands for the revision
       number (if any).  The paper number should be inserted at the
       beginning (top right) of an ASCII document text file.  For any
       document file that is formatted for printing, (i.e., .ps,
       .pdf, .rtf, .tex, .doc, document files, etc.) the J3 paper
       number and a page number should appear at the top right hand
       side of each page of the document.

    c. J3 document files should be formatted so that they can be
       printed out conveniently on either A4 (European) or 8.5" x 11"
       (US) paper. The easiest way to do this is to set the margins as
       follows:
                           US                          A4

           Top       0.75 inch (1.91 cm)      1.00 inch (2.54 cm)
           Bottom    0.75 inch (1.91 cm)      1.19 inch (3.30 cm)
           Left      1.00 inch (2.54 cm)      1.00 inch (2.54 cm)
           Right     1.00 inch (2.54 cm)      0.75 inch (1.91 cm)

       If these margins are used for the appropriate size of paper,
       then the printed area will be 9.5" x 6.5", or 24.1 cm x 16.5 cm,
       regardless of the original paper size.   Do not use fonts other
       than the standard ones available on modern printers.  The
       preferred font is Courier New (10 characters per inch).

    d. When the document is completed and contains the assigned paper
       number, the submitter should send the file(s) via email to the
       J3 Librarian.  The Librarian will check the format and print out
       one copy of each paper to archive and use as an original for
       reproduction at the meeting if needed.  Then the Librarian will
       archive the electronic file(s) by uploading them to the current
       web server for compression and storage in the appropriate
       subdirectory on the server located at www.j3-fortran.org.

Authors of papers are advised that papers are listed by title, and
are assigned to subgroups for consideration by topic.  Therefore,
limiting a paper to one topic described in the title assists the
processing of papers and is encouraged.  Likewise, authors wanting
to comment on clarity or editorial style are encouraged to limit
the paper to one section of the draft standard.

For each paper submitted or revised per the above guidelines and
stored on the server, the Librarian will update the standing document
J3/yy-000, which is available as the ASCII text file yy-000.txt on
the server.  The Librarian will also update the server file papermno.txt
(where mno is the next J3 meeting number), which is a list of the
papers currently submitted for consideration at the next J3 meeting mno.
