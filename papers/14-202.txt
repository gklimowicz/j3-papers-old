1. Introduction
===============

Fortran 2008 added the ability to optionally specify the type of
the index-name directly in a forall-header (R752), allowing the
programmer to specify the type of this construct entity at the
point where it is created, rather than inheriting the type from
the enclosing scope. This applies to FORALL and DO CONCURRENT.

This feature was not also applied to the ac-do-variable in an
array constructor implied-DO (R473), which, as a statement
entity it would also benefit from the option of local type
specification. This omission creates an asymmetry in the language
that should be corrected in the next standard.

A similar case can be made for the data-i-do-variable in
data-implied-do (R539), which is also a statement entity.

Note that io-implied-do does not create a statement or construct
entity, so this issue does not apply there.

Suggested edits, in reference to 14-007r1, are provided to correct
this defect.
