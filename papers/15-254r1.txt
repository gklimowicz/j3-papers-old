Reference: 15-007r2

This is mostly typos and similar, perhaps this paper can be passed
directly to the Editor.

Edits:

{Note 7.1 [135] the "PERSON(12, 'Jones')" appears to continue

the type person example from clause 4 [63].  But the components

are in the wrong order.  Edits are proposed, if only because
but we noticed this and don't want to lose the reference just in case.

We do usually remark when one note depends upon another.}



[135:27+ 7.1.2.1 "Overall expression syntax"]

 Change "PERSON (12, 'Jones')"

 to     "PERSON ('Jones', 12)".



***

{Note 7.3: is the box right? At least 2 pdf viewers display it badly-
the box does not go all the way to the bottom of the page}

[136-137] Note 7.3 box appears short on page 136

***

{7.1.7p3+ Note 7.29 spelling of "inadvertant"
should be "inadvertent"}

[149:18+] in Note 7.29 change "inadvertant"
to "inadvertent"

***

{[156] 7.2.1.3p3 in the following bullet list,
the English seems questionable:
the final word of the last sentence before the list ends with "with",
but 3/4 of the items start with the word "if"; the final "with"
appears to be applicable to only the 2nd item}

{we defer to the editor whether this is worthy of correction,
but we suggest the following rewrite}

[156:20-24 7.2.1.3 "Interpretation of intrinsic assignments"]

Replace the 4 bullets on line 20-24 with:

 "o the same dynamic type as <expr> if the variable is polymorphic,

  o each deferred type parameter equal to the corresponding type

    parameter of <expr>,

  o the same bounds as before if the variable is an array and <expr>

    is scalar, and

  o the shape of <expr> with each lower bound equal to the corresponding

    element of LBOUND (<expr>) if <expr> is an array.".


{correct English to improve readability}
