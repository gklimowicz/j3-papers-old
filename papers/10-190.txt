Discussion:

With the original model of using two descriptor formats, the actual
arguments passed to a C function were the Fortran descriptors. The
form of these was not specified, so the corresponding format parameter
had to be void *. The new model passes the C descriptor which has a
known type, so it is better to specify the formal parameter as
CFI_cdesc_t.

The current draft of the TR omits the specification of how interfaces
with type(*) dummy arguments interoperate.

Edits are provided to address these issues.


Edits to 10-165:

[14:32] At the end of item (6)(a) in para 2 of 5.3.8, delete "or".

[14:34] At the end of item (6)(b) in para 2 of 5.3.8, replace "void."
with "CFI_cdesc_t, or".

[14:34+] Add a new subitem to the end of item (6) in para 2 of 5.3.8:

   "(c) the dummy argument is assumed-type and not allocatable,
        assumed-shape, assumed-rank, or a pointer, and corresponds to
        a formal parameter of the prototype that is a pointer to
        void."
