Discussion

The second sentence of NOTE 2.9: "On a shared-memory machine, a co-array 
could be implemented as a section of an array of higher rank." is not 
correct. 

For a simple example, suppose there are 2 images, an actual argument 
is a co-array declared with dimension (3) and the corresponding dummy 
argument is a co-array declared with dimension (2,*). In array element 
order, the entries of the dummy co-array on the two images are

   a(1,1)[1] a(2,1)[1] a(1,2)[1] a(1,1)[2] a(2,1)[2] a(1,2)[2]

No array of rank 3 has elements missing like this. 

For another example, suppose the actual argument is an co-array of shape 
[10] and the corresponding dummy argument is a co-array of shape [3,3].
Again, there are missing elements.

We therefore propose a rewording of the sentence. 


Edit to J3/07-007

[20:24+] In the note at the end of 2.4.6 Co-array, change the second 
sentence to

"On a shared-memory machine, a co-array on an image and the corresponding
co-arrays on other images could be implemented as a sequence of arrays with 
evenly spaced starting addresses."
