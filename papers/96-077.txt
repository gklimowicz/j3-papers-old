  <FORTREQ>
  <NUMBER> 111
  <TITLE> Local declaration block
  <KEYWORDS> SCOPING
  <STATUS> Registered
  <TARGET>
  <SUBGROUP> 
  <VERSION> 1

  <REQUIREMENT>
  Provide a mechanism for declaring entities with a more limited scope than
  an entire procedure or main program.

  <JUSTIFICATION>
  When a program requires an explicitly named temporary, the nature of that
  entity is clearer to both the compiler and human readers if its scope can
  be limited.

  <SUGGESTED IMPLEMENTATION>
  A SCOPE ... END SCOPE construct with usual nesting rules relative to other
  block constructs.

  <ESTIMATED IMPACT>
  Impact on the document should be localized.

  Impact on existing processors involves stealing heavily from the
  implementation of internal procedures.
