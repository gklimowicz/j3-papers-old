Issue 112: [394: 1-6]

1. Introduction

Issue 112 mentions that note 16.18 in 16.2.6 needs an example. The
example in note 16.17 covers this. Notes 16.17 and 16.18 are
combined, in order to improve the clarity of the text. The combined note is also moved backwards in the standard, in order to improve the clarity.

Note that the reference to section 16.2.4 in the J3 note of issue 112 should be to section 16.2.6.

2. Edits

[393:9+] Add a new note, and keep the formatting as in note 16.17:

For example, a Fortran function with an interface described by

BIND(C) INTEGER(C_SHORT) FUNCTION FUNC(I,J,K,L,M)
  USE ISO_C_BINDING
  INTEGER(C_INT), VALUE :: I
  REAL(C_DOUBLE) :: J
  INTEGER(C_INT) :: K
  INTEGER(C_INT) :: L(10)
  TYPE(C_PTR), VALUE :: M
END FUNCTION FUNC

interoperates with a C function with an interface described by

short func(int i; double *j; int *k; int l[10]; void *m)

A C pointer may correspond to a Fortran dummy argument of type C_PTR
with the VALUE attribute or to a Fortran scalar that does not have the VALUE attribute. In the example, the C pointers 'j' and 'k' correspond to the Fortran scalars 'J' and 'K', respectively, and the C pointer 'm' corresponds to the Fortran dummy argument 'M' of type C_PTR.
