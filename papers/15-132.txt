Subject: Changes to C_LOC in F2008
Date: 2015 February 15

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F08/0131
TITLE: Are the changes to C_LOC in the 2010 revision intentional?
KEYWORDS: C_LOC, interoperability
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The description of C_LOC in the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING permits
noninteroperable array arguments that are contiguous.  This was not
permitted by the previous revision of ISO/IEC 1539-1, however this is
not listed in the Introduction as a change.

Was this change intended?

(Also, the Introduction does not mention that C_SIZEOF is new, rather
than something about it having changed.)

ANSWER:

Yes, this change was intentional.  An edit is provided to add this to
the Introduction.

EDITS:

[xvi] Introduction, "Intrinsic modules" bullet point,
  Before "The function C_SIZEOF"
  insert new sentence
    "A contiguous noninteroperable array that has the POINTER or
     TARGET attribute can be used as the argument of the function
     C_LOC in the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING."
  and also change
    "The function C_SIZEOF"
  to
    "The new function C_SIZEOF".
