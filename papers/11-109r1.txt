Discussion:

This paper is a response to UTI TR10 in N1838.  In 5.2.8,
Interoperability of procedures and procedure interfaces, the
interoperability between a variable of type CHARACTER and a formal
parameter of type CFI_cdest_t was mistakenly claimed.  CHARACTER is
interoperable with a pointer to CFI_cdesc_t.  Edits are provided to
fix this error.


Edits to N1838:

[17:4] In paragraph 3 of 5.2.8, Interoperability of procedures and
procedure interfaces, replace the following in 6b:

"and corresponds to a formal parameter of type CFI_cdest_t,"

with

"and corresponds to a formal parameter of the prototype that is a
pointer to CFI_cdesc_t,"
