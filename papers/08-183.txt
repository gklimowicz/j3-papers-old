NUMBER: F03/0098
TITLE: Does allocate with source= define subcomponents?
KEYWORDS: allocate, source, define
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Was it intended that an allocate with a source= clause define
subcomponents?

Bullet 11 on 422 says "Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement
...causes the subcomponent to become undefined."

ANSWER:

An Allocate with a SOURCE= specifier was intended to define
subcomponents.

In fact, none of the lists in clause 16 account for a SOURCE=
specifier.  Edits are supplied to clarify this.

EDITS:

[113:21]  At the end of the last sentence in 6.3.1.1 insert
  "unless the SOURCE= specifier appears and the corresponding
   component of the <source-expr> is allocated".

[421:27] 16.5.5, list item 19, after "Allocation", insert
  ", except by an ALLOCATE statement with a SOURCE= specifier,"

[421:28+] 16.5.5, insert new list item after (19)
  "(19a) Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement with a SOURCE=
         specifier causes a subobject of the allocated object to
         become defined if the corresponding subobject of the SOURCE=
         expression is defined."

[422:41-42] 16.5.6, list item (11), replace list item with
  "Successful allocation of an ALLOCATE statement with no SOURCE=
   specifier causes a subcomponent of an allocated object to become
   undefined if default initialization has not been specified for
   that subcomponent."

[422:43+]  16.5.6, add a new list item after (11),
  "(11a) Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement with a SOURCE=
         specifier causes a subobject of the allocated object to
         become undefined if the corresponding subobject of the
         SOURCE= expression is undefined."
