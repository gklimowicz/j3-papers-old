Discussion

In the description of the INT function Result Value, Case (iv) says "If A
is a <boz-literal-constant>, it is treated as if it were an
<int-literal-constant> ...".  This is essentially meaningless as written. 
There is no syntax connection between boz and int literal constants, and
only a vague connection between their values as specified in 13.3 Bit
model.  That model does not even take into account whether the high order
bit is set.  This defective description was fixed as part of the BITS
feature, but is back to being defective again in the latest draft.  The
words used in the REAL description are much closer to accurate. In the
absence of a BITS type, edits are provided to parallel the description
from REAL.  Also, similar words in the description of the DATA statement
are replaced by a reference to the INT intrinsic so that the rule appears
in only one place.

Edits to 07-007r3:

[110:26] Editor: Insert "<boz-literal-constant>," before "<null-init>"
and a comma after "<null-init>".

[110:31-33] Replace para 11 of 5.4.6 DATA statement with:

"If a <data-stmt-constant> is a <boz-literal-constant>, the corresponding
variable shall be of type integer. The <boz-literal-constant> is treated
as if it were converted by the INT intrinsic function (13.7.87) to type
integer with the kind type parameter of the variable."

[386:26-28] In the Result Value description of the INT intrinsic
(13.7.87) replace Case(iv) with:

"<Case (iv):> If A is a <boz-literal-constant>, the value of the
              result is the value that a variable of the same
              type and kind type parameter as the result would have if
              its value were the bit pattern specified by the
              <boz-literal-constant>. The interpretation of the value
              of the bit pattern is processor dependent."

[411:25] Editor: Delete "equal to".
