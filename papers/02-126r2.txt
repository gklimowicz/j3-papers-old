All comments (unless otherwise noted) apply to the January 2002 PDF
Version of  007.

1)          Section 13, page 277, line 3.  Replace a tautology with
current status.

Proposal:  277:3  Change "Intrinsic subroutines may be elemental" to
"Some intrinsic subroutines are elemental"

2)          Page 278:17, make the section title singular, there is only
one bit model

Proposal:  278:17, change "models" to "model"

3)          Page 279:23-24  The sentence is awkward and doesn't use
the correct terms.  I think the trailing "them" dangles.

Proposal:  Change 279:23-24 "The numeric manipulation and inquiry
functions provide values related to the parameters and other constants
related to them."
To  "The floating-point manipulation functions (13.5.10) and numeric
inquiry functions (13.5.6) provide the values of some parameters and
other values related to the models."

4)	Withdrawn

5)          Page 280, note 13.7  The description of BACK is untrue
(or misleading)  I'd read "indicate" to mean if it is present then the
scan is backwards.  But, it's also got to be TRUE

Proposal.  Note 13.7 Change description of BACK to "Controls the
direction of a string scan (forward or backward)"

6)          Withdrawn

7)          Withdrawn
