Subject: Intrinsic and Non-intrinsic Modules??

One item in n1510 asks whether an Intrinsic module
and a non-intrinsic module can have the same name
in the same program.

Aside from a desire to punish anyone who attempts this
sort of foolishness, I think we can answer "NO".

No edits are necessary, since 395:19-20 seems pretty clear
to me.

But John would like something added to clarify further,
and he has suggested the language below.

EDITS:

395:20+ Add

"A nonintrinsic module shall not have the same name as an intrinsic
module that is accessed anywhere in the program."
