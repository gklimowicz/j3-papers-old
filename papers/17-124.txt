Subject: Redundant and misleading constraint

1. Introduction

Subclause 11.1.5.1 Purpose and form of the CHANGE TEAM construct, contains
constraint C1112 which states
  "C1112 An exit-stmt or cycle-stmt within a CHANGE TEAM construct shall
         not belong to an outer construct."
which leads one to believe that an EXIT statement within a CHANGE TEAM
construct can belong to that construct.

But this is untrue, as 11.1.12 EXIT statement, contains constraint C1166
which states
  "C1166 An exit-stmt shall not appear within a CHANGE TEAM, CRITICAL, or
         DO CONCURRENT construct if it belongs to that construct or an
         outer construct."

The confusing partial redundancy in C1112 should be removed to avoid
confusion.  This would leave C1112 referring only to CYCLE statements; on
closer examination, 11.1.7.4.4 CYCLE statement, contains constraint C1135
which states
  "C1135 A cycle-stmt shall not appear within a CHANGE TEAM, CRITICAL, or
         DO CONCURRENT construct if it belongs to an outer construct."
rendering C1112 fully redundant and its only purpose is to mislead.


2. Edits to 17-007

[187:16] 11.1.5.1 Purpose and form of the CHANGE TEAM construct,
         Delete constraint C1112, which reads
  "C1112 An <exit-stmt> or <cycle-stmt> within a CHANGE TEAM construct
         shall not belong to an outer construct."
{Delete redundant misdirection.}
