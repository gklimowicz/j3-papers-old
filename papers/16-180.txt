----------

It was intended that ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, and the synchronization
statements continue to work on active images in the presence of failed
images. This is in the hope that the user can arrange for the
calculation to continue in this case. It is confusing to describe such
executions as successful. The solution seems to be to describe these
as erroneous but nevertheless to specify that when STAT_FAILED_IMAGE
is returned the expected actions will have occurred on the active
images.


Edits to J3/16-007r1
--------------------

[137:4] In 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, after the first sentence add
"Otherwise, if a failed image is detected but the allocations or
deallocations were performed successfully on all the active images of
the current team, the STAT= specifier is assigned the value of the
named constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."

[137:6] In 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, at the end of the second
sentence add "and STAT_FAILED_IMAGE".

[137:6] In 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, at the start of the third
sentence change "In either case" to "For an error condition for which
the STAT= specifier is assigned a value other than STAT_FAILED_IMAGE".

[136-21+] In 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 2, delete UTI 16.
