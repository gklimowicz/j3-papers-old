Subject:  Defining Bit, Byte, and Octet


     1.   Rationale
  The terms "bit", "byte", and "octet" are widely used throughout the
software industry.  All three
terms already have widely accepted definitions.  Defining them with the
industry-standard definitions
will make the development of current and future Fortran standards easier
than would otherwise be the
case.

     2.   Technical specification and syntax
  Define the terms "bit", "byte", and "octet" as follows.

  A bit or binary digit is a unit of information that can be represented by
either a zero (0) or one
(1).  An octet or byte is a group of contiguous bits operated on as a unit.

     3.   Edits
  The following edits are with respect to 98-007r3.

            [18:6+]     Add the following paragraph to section 2.4.7:
  A bit or binary digit is a unit of information that can be represented by
either a zero (0) or one
(1).  An octet or byte is a group of contiguous bits operated on as a unit.

          [360:11+] Add the following to the glossary (Annex A):
               bit (2.4.7):   A unit of information that can be represented
by either a zero (0) or one (1).

          [360:17+] Add the following to the glossary (Annex A):
               byte (2.4.7):  Same as octet.

          [365:10+] Add the following to the glossary (Annex A):
               octet (2.4.7): A group of contiguous bits operated on as a
unit.
