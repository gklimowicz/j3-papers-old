From: Bill Long
Subject: GB-18: floating point status
Date: 2010 February 01

This paper provides edits for comment GB-18 from the Ballot summary,
N1802.

Discussion:

It is not clear in clause 14 that each image has its own
floating-point status. Add a Note to make this clear.  The Note is a
restatement of the text at [32:10] which states "Each image has its
own ... floating-point status (14.7) ...".

Edits to J3/09-007r3:

[407:28+] In 14.7 "The floating-point status", after paragraph 1 and
before the current first Note (Note 14.6) insert a new Note:

"Note 14.5a

Each image has its own floating-point status (2.3.4)"
