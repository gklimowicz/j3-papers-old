Discussion

For consistency with the existing intrinsics, the name of the argument
of IS_CONTIGUOUS should be ARRAY, and the description should refer to
an "array" rather than an "object".


Edits to J3/08-007r2 (WG5/N1723):

[319] In Table 13.1 of 13.5 Standard generic intrinsic procedures, in
the entry for IS_CONTIGUOUS, change "A" to "ARRAY" in the Arguments
column, and change "object" to "array" in the Description column.

[358] In 13.7.86 IS_CONTIGUOUS (A), change "A" to "ARRAY" in the
subclause title and in paragraphs 3 and 5.

[358] In 13.7.86 IS_CONTIGUOUS (A), paragraph 1 (Description) change
"object" to "array".
