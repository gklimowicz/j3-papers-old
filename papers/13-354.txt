Discussion
----------

Malcolm Cohen has drawn my attention to a number of deficiences
in the paragraph that specifies the value of the STAT= variable
in the event of an error in an image control statement. Here is
a rewrite.


Edits to N1983:
---------------

[28:28-36] Replace paragraph by

If the STAT= specifier appears in a CHANGE TEAM, END TEAM, EVENT POST,
EVENT WAIT, FORM SUBTEAM, LOCK, SYNC ALL, SYNC IMAGES, SYNC MEMORY, or
UNLOCK statement and an error condition occurs, the specified variable
becomes defined with a nonzero value. The value shall be the constant
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2) if
the reason is that a failed image has been detected in the current
team; otherwise, the value shall be the constant STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE in
the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2) if the reason is that a
successful execution would have involved an interaction with an image
that has initiated termination; otherwise, the value is a processor-
dependent positive value that is different from the value of
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2).

If the STAT= specifier appears in a CHANGE TEAM, END TEAM, EVENT POST,
EVENT WAIT, FORM SUBTEAM, LOCK, SYNC ALL, SYNC IMAGES, or UNLOCK
statement and an error condition occurs, the effect is the same as
that of executing the SYNC MEMORY statement, except for defining the
STAT= variable.
