To: J3
From: John Reid
Subject: Edits for sections 7 to 10
Date: 6 August 2002


124:17. Change 'x_2 match those of d_2' to 'd_2 match the corresponding
type parameters of x_2'.
[x_2 may be an extension of d_2.]

124:36. Change 'x_1 and x_2 match those of d_1 and d_2' to 'd_1 and d_2
match the corresponding type parameters of x_1 and x_2'.

128:24-25. Change sentece to
  An <<initialization expression>> is an expression with limitations
  that ensure that its value cannot change.
[The list is incomplete - better to avoid such a list.]

144:18. Change 'x_1 and x_2 match those of d_1 and d_2' to 'd_1 and d_2
match the corresponding type parameters of x_1 and x_2'.

163:10. After 'causes' add 'execution of its <associate-stmt> followed
by'.

164:11+ (TECHNICAL CHANGE). Replace the note by
   C810a (R822) The form <associate-name => selector> shall be used if
   <selector> is not a named variable.
[The text on page 165 does not work if there is no <associate-name> and
<selector> is not named. Also, I took a long time (unsuccessfully)
trying to understand exactly what the note meant.]

179:10. After ';' add 'if the stream or record file is unformatted,'.
[A stream file may be formatted.]

198:20-21. Change 'The' to 'On input from a file connected for
sequential or direct access, the' and move the sentence to make a new
paragraph at line 24+.
[This does not apply to stream access and is among statements that
refer to both input and output.]

200:16-17. Delete 'shall not process those derived-type list items as
described in 9.5.2. Instead, it'.
[Very confusing since 9.5.2 mentions this form of processing. There are
already enough words in 9.5.2 to make any extra restriction here
unnecessary.]

203:10-11. Change '(or some portion thereof)' to '(or a portion thereof
if the type of the item is an extension of the type of <<dtv>>)'.

216:19-22 (TECHNICAL CHANGE). Replace by
  If the output list in an INQUIRE statement contains an effective item
  that requires a user-defined derived-type input/output procedure as
  described in section 9.5.2, every effective item in the list shall have
  a defined value.
[This means that the implementor has only to perform actual i/o to a
buffer and count the file storage units.]

218:27. Delete ', or an input/output statement that references an
external unit, '.
[Wrong, but done correctly in 9.11.]

218:28+. Change  '7.1.8' to '(7.1.8)'

219:25+. Delete NOTE 9.65. [Already present as NOTE 9.64.]
