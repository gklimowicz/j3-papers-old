1. Introduction

There is some sloppy wording, some of which has been around since F2003,
some more recently introduced. This paper tries to improve matters.


2. Edits to 22-007

[xiv:11] Introduction, para 2, penultimate bullet, "zeroes" => "zeros".

[89:9] 7.6.1 Interoperable enumerations and enum types, p6,
  Change the second sentence
    "The enumerator is defined in accordance with the rules of intrinsic
     assignment (10.2) with the value determined as follows."
  to
    "The enumerator is a scalar named constant, with the value determined
     as follows."
{We don't say explicitly anywhere that it is scalar. It is not defined in
 accordance with the rules of intrinsic assignment, see 8.5.13 PARAMETER
 attribute for how we talk about other named constants.}

[89:10-11] same paragraph, (1),
  Change
    "the value of the enumerator is the result of scalar-int-constant-expr"
  to
    "the enumerator has the value specified by scalar-int-constant-expr".
{Expressions don't have results, they have values.
 See wording in 8.5.13. There's no conversion of the value here.}

[89:13] same paragraph, (2),
        "the value 0" -> "the value zero".
{Style.}

[89:15-16] same paragraph, (3),
  Change
    "its value is the result of adding 1 to the value of the enumerator
     that immediately precedes it in the enum-def"
  to
    "it has the value obtained by adding one to the value of the enumerator
     that immediately precedes it in the enum-def"
{Not sure this is enough of an improvement.}

[91:18] 7.6.2 Enumeration types, p3,
        "named constant" -> "scalar named constant".
{Explicitly state that the enumerators are scalar.}

[91:26] same subclause, p5,
        "returns the value" -> "produces the scalar value".
{It's not a function so cannot return anything.
 It's obviously scalar, but saying it explicitly seems like a good idea.}

[157:0+3] 10.1.5.1 Intrinsic operation classification,
          Table 10.2: Type of operands and results for intrinsic operators,
          Line 1 of box for .GT. et al,
          Change "L, L, N" -> "L, L, L".
{Comparisons return Logical!}

[165:19] 10.1.9.2 Type, type parameters, and shape of a primary, p1,
         After "If it is an enumeration constructor, it is scalar and"
         Change "its type are" -> "its type is".
{Correct number.}
