Discussion:

UTI 152 objects to what appears to be normative text being in a
Note. As a secondary issue, the current order of the subclauses in 2.3
seems illogical.

------------

Edits to 09-007:

[29:16] In 2.3.1 Statement classification, para 2, move the first
sentence (Image execution is ... actions.) to be the second sentence
of 2.3.5 Execution sequence, at [31:9].

[29:16-17] In 2.3.1 Statement classification, para 2, in the second
sentence replace

"one or more of these actions"

with

"an action".

[29:19] In 2.3.1 Statement classification, para 3, delete "do not
specify actions; they". {Functions can be executed as part of
specification expressions.}

[29:21-22] In 2.3.1 Statement classification, delete para 4 (There are
restrictions ... in all contexts.)  {The upcoming Statement order
subclause spells out such restrictions, so it seems redundant to say
they exist.}

[31:9] In 2.3.5 Execution sequence, following the sentence moved from
[29:16] (see edit above) add these new sentences:

"Actions take place during execution of the statement that performs
them (except when explicitly stated otherwise). Segments
(\ref{D8:Segments}) executed by a single image are totally ordered,
and segments executed by separate images are partially ordered by
image control statements (8.5.1)."

[31:9] In 2.3.5 Execution sequence, begin a new paragraph with the
second sentence (If the program contains...) of the text in 09-007.

[31:28-29] In 2.3.5 Execution sequence, delete para 2. {It is mostly
redundant with the new text above.}

[31:29+] In 2.3.5 Execution sequence, delete Note 2.7.

[31:7+] Move the whole text of 2.3.2 Program execution
([29:23]-[30:1-]) to after 2.3.4 The END statement, retaining its
status as a subclause.

{After this change, the outline reads

    2.3 Execution concepts
        2.3.1 Statement classification
        2.3.2 Statement order
        2.3.3 The END statement
        2.3.4 Program execution
        2.3.5 Execution sequence

which places the statement subclauses together and the execution
subclauses together, rather than having them interleaved.}
