Discussion
----------

The text for FORM TEAM (8.6.9) makes it clear that execution of
FORM TEAM involves the synchronization of all the active images of
the current team. Therefore, all that is needed is to change "same
execution" to "synchronized executions". It will also be helpful to
refer to 8.6.9.

The sentence "Information about the team to which the current image
belongs can be determined by the processor from the collective value
of the team variables on the images of the team." was not copied to
8.6.9 by the editor because he thought the meaning was unclear. It
was intended to explain what the editors calls "synchronized values".
We have reworded this as a note because it is not normative text.

Edit to J3/16-007r1
-------------------

[177:25] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, para 2, sentence 1, replace
"same execution" by "synchronized executions" and add "(8.6.9)" at the
end of the sentence.

[206:32+]. In 8.6.9 FORM TEAM statement, after NOTE 8.44 add new NOTE:
"After successful execution of a FORM TEAM statement, the values of the
team variables on all images of each new team may collectively enable
efficient collaboration among the images of that new team."
