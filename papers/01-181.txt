References: 01-168R1

Unresolved issue 144, p. 20, says that the usage of the term
"link" is inconsistent.

Unresolved issue 177, p. 405, complains about the glossary
entry for "linked".

Unresolved issue 168, p. 448, says that section C.9.2 may
require revision in light of changes to 12.5.3 .

Discussion:

The complaint in issue 177 says that the language implies
that there are two copies of a procedure, one in C and one
in Fortran. But the edits in 01-168R1 make it clear that
there is only one definition for a given procedure. In C
parlance, there may be many declarations, but only one
definition.

Thus subgroup believes that the glossary entry for "linked"
is fine as it stands.

Issue 144 is resolved by an edit to clarify that two
procedures are linked. The edit is to section 12.5.3.

In reviewing the changes to 12.5.3, subgroup saw no need
to change C.9.2 .
