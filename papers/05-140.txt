Subject: Separators in list-directed output involving UDDTIO

TITLE: Separators in list-directed output involving UDDTIO
KEYWORDS: list-directed output, separators, UDDTIO
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m
  TYPE t
    INTEGER i
  END TYPE
  INTERFACE WRITE(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedWriteT
  END INTERFACE
CONTAINS
  SUBROUTINE formattedWriteT(dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(t),         INTENT(IN)    :: dtv
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: unit
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: v_list(:)
    INTEGER,          INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

    WRITE(unit, *) dtv%i, 'a'
  END SUBROUTINE
END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  TYPE(t) :: t1 = t(5)
  OPEN(10, FILE='foo.txt', ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL', FORM='FORMATTED', &
       DELIM='NONE')
  WRITE(10, *), 'xyz', t1, 'zyx'
END PROGRAM

10.9.2 of Fortran 2003 states that character sequences produced for
list-directed output are not separated from each other by value
separators when the delimiter mode is NONE.  The implication of this
is obvious when the adjacent effective output list items are both of
character type.  But when user-defined derived-type input/output
is involved, it is much less clear whether a separator should be
included in the output.

In the example given, it is unclear whether the output should be:
 xyz 5 azyx
or:
 xyz 5 a zyx

1. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   one of the character sequences is written by a child data transfer
   statement, and the other is written by a parent data transfer
   statement, where both statements are list-directed?

2. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   the character sequences are written by two different child data
   transfer statements, where both statements are list-directed?

3. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   one of the character sequences is written by a child data transfer
   statement, and the other is written by a parent data transfer
   statement, where one of the statements is list-directed and the
   other is format-directed?

4. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   the character sequences are written by two different child data
   transfer statements, where one of the statements is list-directed
   and the other is format-directed?
