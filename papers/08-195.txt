--------------------------------

  /J3

    The J3 meeting (#184) was called to order at 8:00 AM, Monday,
    May 12, 2008, at the Emerald Suites, Las Vegas, NV, USA,
    by the J3 chair, Dan Nagle.

1.1 Opening business                             D. Nagle

    The Chairman welcomed everyone.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair                     D. Nagle

    Dan said the major work for this meeting was to resolve comments
    on the current draft Fortran 2008, 07-007r2, to start creating
    the US position on F2008, and to continue answering
    interpretations.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda                         D. Nagle

** motion: Adopt the agenda as amended (moved by Van Snyder/
           seconded by Michael Ingrassia): passed by unanimous
           consent {uc}

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 183 minutes            D. Nagle

** motion: Approve paper 08-139, the minutes of meeting #183
           (Whitlock/Long): uc

1.1.4 INCITS/SDB report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    PL22 had an organizational meeting and adopted new standard
    operating procedures.  All existing task groups {including
    J3} were grandfathered to retain their previous powers,
    including the ability to approve US positions on international
    questions.

    Dan will become a member of PL22.

    The US public comment period on the draft F2008 is June 6 -
    July 7, 2008.

    J3 needs to formalize its liaison list.  See closing business.

    PL22 accepted the list of proposed emeritus members:

      At the April 2008 meeting of the INCITS Executive Board, the
      INCITS/J3 nominations of the following persons for emeritus
      membership on INCITS/J3 were reviewed and approved:

        Keith Bierman
        Walt Brainerd
        Kurt Hirchert
        Tom Lahey
        Richard Maine
        Loren Meissner
        Mallory North
        Brian Smith
        Jerry Wagener

    J3 expressed its thanks to INCITS for naming these emeritus
    members.

1.1.5 OWG-V report (if any)                      D. Nagle

    The draft is done and is in editorial review.  It is called
    N0125 and will probably be out next year.  Dan would like
    help creating a Fortran appendix that would be like sections
    6 and 7, written in Fortran.  The draft is under the Documents
    tab in the left pane at

      www.aitcnet.org/isai

1.1.6 ISO/WG5 report                             Van Snyder, IR

    The last J3 meeting, #183, was joint with WG5.  It went well.

    The next WG5 meeting is a joint meeting with J3 in Tokyo in
    November, 2008.

1.1.7 J11 Liaison report (if any)                C. Rasmussen

    Nothing new to report on J11.

    Craig reported on MPI.  He is working with a group to fix the
    Fortran bindings to MPI.

1.1.8 H2 Liaison report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    Nothing new to report.

    We need to decide if J3 wants to keep a liaison with H2 about
    SQL.  The sentiment was no.  See closing business.

1.1.9 IEEE 754 report (if any)                   M. Ingrassia

    The latest ballot is complete - there are no changes.  The
    revision is on track to be accepted.

    Van reported on IFIP Working Group 2.5 on Numerical
    Software.  This group was unsuccessful at getting interval
    arithmetic into IEEE 754.  So they started a new effort to
    create a separate IEEE standard for interval arithmetic and
    "complete" arithmetic.

1.1.10 Treasurer's report                         V. Snyder

    The ending balance at the previous meeting was $1991.76 .
    
    There is a $50 meeting fee starting with meeting 184.
