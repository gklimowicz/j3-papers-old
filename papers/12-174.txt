Pre-remark: The issue was found by Ian Harvey at comp.lang.fortran.
The change was done from 08-007r2 to 09-007 (in C1280); the change
was proposed in 08-181 and is listed in the editor's report 09-102.

TITLE: Pointer arguments to PURE functions
KEYWORDS: PURE function, pointer, intent(in)
DEFECT TYPE: TBD
STATUS: TDB

QUESTION:

Fortran 2003 prohibited the modification of the arguments to pure
functions via

   C1272   In a pure subprogram any designator with a base object
   that is in common or accessed by host or use association,
   is a dummy argument of a pure function, is a dummy argument with
   INTENT (IN) of a pure subroutine, or an object that is storage
   associated with any such variable, shall not be used in the
   following contexts: [...]

In Fortran 2008, the constraint was modified to:

   C1283   In a pure subprogram any designator with a base object
   that is in common or accessed by host or use association,
   is a dummy argument with the INTENT (IN) attribute,
   is a coindexed object, or an object that is storage associated
   with any such variable, shall not be used [...]

(1) Is the following procedure standard conforming and, if so, was it
intended to be standard conforming?

      pure function F( X )
        real, pointer :: X
        real :: F
        f = 1.0
        x = 2.0
      end function F

(2) Is the following procedure standard conforming and, if so, was it
intended to be standard conforming?

      pure function G ( X )
        real, pointer :: X
        real :: G
        g = 1.0
        nullify ( x )
      end function G

ANSWER:

Both functions are standard conforming, but were not intended to be.  It
was intended that pure functions do not have side effects.  In Fortran
2003, C1272 prohibited assigning a value to the target of X, and
prohibited changing the association status of X, by way of the
definition of "variable definition context."  It was an
oversight to remove "is a dummy argument of a pure function" from
Fortran 2008.  Edits are provided to repair this defect.

EDITS:

[1.6.1+ 12-007:24:7+] Insert a subclause:

"1.6.1a Fortran 2008 compatibility

Except as identified in this subclause, this part of ISO/IEC 1539 is an
upward compatible extension of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010.  With the following
exceptions, any standard-conforming Fortran 2008 program remains
standard-conforming under this part of ISO/IEC 1539.

  o Fortran 2008 allowed a pure function to cause a side effect by
    assigning a value to the target of a pointer dummy argument, or by
    changing its association status.  This is now prohibited."

[12.7 C1283 12-007:312:31] Insert ", is a dummy argument of a pure
function" after "association".

REMARK:

It would not be feasible to require that pointer dummy arguments of pure
functions have the INTENT(IN) attribute, as this would be a significant
departure from compatibility with Fortran 2003 and Fortran 2008.
