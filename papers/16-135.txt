1. Introduction
===============

The tables of results in the descriptions of IAND etc. have numeric
values, not logical values.  As such, they are simply "tables," not
"truth tables."

2. Edits
========

Delete "truth" at [370:7 13.8.83p5], [372:20 13.8.89p5], [374:12
13.8.93p5], [392:9 13.8.135p5]
