       Date: 98-05-28

       JOR has decided to add a note in chapter 14, near the list
       of statements that, when used in an internal procedure or
       module procedure, "create" a local variable for entities
       in those statements rather than accessing the same named
       variable from the host via host association.

       Edits against 98-007r1:

       Section 14.6.1.3 [311:8+], add a new note:
	 "Note: a name that appears in an ASYNCHRONOUS statement is
	  not necessarily the name of a local variable.  When a
	  variable that is otherwise accessible via host association
	  is specified in an ASYNCHRONOUS statement, that host
	  variable is given the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute in the scope
	  of the current internal or module procedure.".


       Note that we'll probably add the <volatile-stmt> here later.
