Date:        11 Aug 98
To:          J3
From:        R. Maine
Subject:     More misc editorial changes

The following miscellaneous edits are proposed.  The editor does not
believe that any of these edits make technical changes.  Some of
them are from paper 98-180, after discussion.

  [152:34-35] Move the "an <external-file-unit> shall be specified"
  clause to the beginning of the constraint at [152:32-33], with
  apprpriate punctuation changes.

  [32:37] Delete "If the processor supports lower case letters, "
  and capitalize the following "T".

  [37:11-12,14-15] Delete ", if the processor supports lower-case
  letters" twice.

  [40:8-9] Move these 2 lines (part of R431) to [39:29+] (part of R428),
  and change <entity> to <decl>.  Edit was put in wrong place and
  used a term from an earlier revision.

  [65:14-17] Replace "The EXTERNAL attribute may also be implicitly
  specified (???)." and the J3 note by a separate para reading

   "Any name that is used in a scoping unit as the <function-name>
    of a <function-reference> or as the <subroutine-name> of a
    <call-stmt> implicitly acquires the external attribute in
    that scoping unit if it is not the name of an accessible
    statement function or internal procedure, is not accessed
    by host or USE association, and is not explicitly given
    the external attribute."

  [170:21] Change "iotype" to code font.

  [193:18] Fix garbled line in table.

  [219:28-31] Replace "If the interface block...USE statement" with
  "The PROCEDURE statement lists those procedure pointers, external
  procedures, dummy procedures, or module procedures that have this
  generic interface."  This sentence had not been updated to
  reflect changes in the former MODULE PROCEDURE statement.  The
  former second sentence here was superfluous and also now
  incorrect, so this edit just omits it.

  [335:29,39] [336:10,35] Add "the" after "if".
