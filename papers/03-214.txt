		Report II from subgroup Chapter 8 onwards


Paper N1545

Subgroup recommends acceptance, but WG5 has not had sufficient time
to consider this.

Changed and additional edits:

407:19    "global entities" should be boldfaced
408:8     "binding names" -> "type-bound procedure bindings"
408:18-19 "any local or global" -> "an"
408:In the new text for Note 16.3  "class 1" -> "class (1)"
411:26,34 "class 1" -> class (1)"
412:30-35 Needs attention of J3, subgroup doesn't believe there is a
          problem with this section
413:24    Needs attention of J3 (should the semicolon be there ?)


Paper N1547

WG5 recommends acceptance with the following amendments:

Section 1
245:5+3 "may not" -> "cannot" (instead of "shall not")
467:32 -> 467:42              (line number wrong)

Section 2
WG5 recommends the following edits:
8:26  Delete "This standard ... ASCII standard."
40:12 After "1991", insert "(International Reference Version)"
42:12 Replace "the ASCII standard" by "ISO/IEC 646:1991
      (International Reference Version)"
      [this is overruled by WG5's edits as a result of N1524 below]

Section 3
No amendments.

    paper 03-138r1

        Deferred to subgroup 1-7.

    paper 03-154r3

        24:17 WG5 agrees; proposed edit:
              Replace "relevant standard" by
              "ISO/IEC 646:1991 (International Reference Version) and
              ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 UCS-4, respectively"
        40:13+ now refers to 42:12-13. WG5 agrees; proposed edit:
              42:12-13 Replace by:
              "The collating sequence for the ASCII character type is as
              defined by ISO/IEC 646:1991 (International Reference Version);
              this collating sequence is called the
              <<ASCII collating sequence>> in this standard."
              42:13+ Replace NOTE 4.16 by:
              "The intrinsic functions ACHAR (13.7.2) and IACHAR (13.7.45)
              provide conversion between characters and corresponding
              integer values according to the ASCII collating sequence."
        141:4+ now refers to 143:12. WG5 agrees. Edits at the
              discretion of J3.
        193:14 now refers to 195:25-196:1. Rejected by WG5,
              because it was intended this way (default character type
              might contain characters not suitable for an ASCII internal
              file, while an ISO 10646 internal file is suited for all
              characters).
              195:21-196:1 WG5 recommends to leave "contain" as is;
                           "item" is a term well defined in this section.
        224:14+ now refers to 228:11+. The conversion mentioned here
              applies to all subsequent data editing, so it is in the
              right place; WG5 recommends to do nothing.
              "Conversion" issue: The conversion mentioned in 10.6 is
              concerned with the conversion caused by data edit descriptors.
              WG5 recommends to do nothing.
        210:12+ now refers to 214:17+. WG5 does not understand the
              problem; this issue does not arise with formatted files.
        343:13+ now refers to 351:16+. 03-154r3 explains what to do.

    paper 03-155r1

        301:27-28 now refers to 308:7-8.  WG5 recommends to insert
              a comma between "negative real zero" and "and".
        324:15-16 now refers to 331:11-12.  Same change.

    paper 03-157r1

        268:7 now refers to 274:7.  WG5 rejects this change.  The
              definition of C character kind type is in 15.1.1;
              WG5 disagrees with moving it.
        405:36 now refers to 418:7.  Same issue.

    paper 03-159r2

        351:37-38 WG5 agrees; proposes edit:
              Replace "2 ... respectively" with "two integer kinds, 32
              with representation method r=2 and q=31, and 64 with
              representation method r=2 and q=63".

    paper 03-162r2

        110:24-25 now refers to 113:1+. WG5 proposes the following
              alternative edits:
        113:6 Delete "An allocatable variable has a status of
              <<unallocated>> if it is not allocated.".
        113:7 Change "unallocated" to "<<unallocated>>".
        113:8 Change "an allocation" to "the allocation".
        287:15 now refers to 293:15. WG5 agrees that MOVE_ALLOC is not
            elemental; it is pure, though.  Proposed edit:
            293:15 Replace the first sentence with:
                "The subroutine MOVE_ALLOC and the elemental subroutine
                MVBITS are pure."
        [13.5.14+1] now refers to 299:28. WG5 proposes the following edits:
            299:28 Replace "procedures" by "procedure".
            299:29 Replace "Transfers" by "Moves".
            339:24 Replace "Transfers" by "Moves".
        339:29 Change "remains" to "becomes".
        340:3 Change "such a pointer" to "any pointer associated with FROM
              on entry".
        340:8 Add closing parenthesis to the ALLOCATE statement.
            WG5 thinks the other parts of 13.7.82 are OK.
        404:29+ now refers to 416:29.  WG5 agrees that this is wrong.
            Proposed edit:
            416:28-29 Replace by
                "The allocation transfer procedure (13.7.82) is executed
                with the pointer associated with the argument FROM and an
                object without the target attribute associated with the
                argument TO."

    paper 03-164r1

        Deferred to subgroup 1-7.

    paper 03-172r1

        180:5 now refers to 182:13 WG5 agrees; proposed edit:
        182:12-13 Replace "Input/output ... external file" with:
              "If a procedure defined by means of Fortran and a procedure
              defined by means other than Fortran perform input/output
              operations on the same external file, the results are
              processor dependent." (text copied from 405:27-28).
