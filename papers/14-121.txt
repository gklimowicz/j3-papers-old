Subject: Additional or revised edits arising from 14-117
Date: 2014 February 11

1. Introduction
===============

Edits are proposed here for issues raised in 14-117r1.  Additional new
semantics for WAIT are proposed: A WAIT statement is allowed to refer to
a unit that is connected to a file that does not exist.  This is already
allowed for a FLUSH statement.

2. Edits
========

[14-007:201:3-4] {Revised from 14-117} 9.3.2 File existence, p3, change
            "An INQUIRE ... also may refer"
          to
            "A CLOSE, ENDFILE, FLUSH, INQUIRE, OPEN, PRINT, REWIND, WAIT,
             or WRITE statement is permitted to refer".

[14-007:201:6] At the end of the paragraph, append "No other statement
shall refer to a file that does not exist."

[14-007:207:21-22] Replace "may" by "are permitted to" twice.

[14-007:207:22] At the end of the paragraph, append "No other statement
shall refer to a unit that does not exist."

[14-007:208:27] Before "If" insert "Before any effect on changeable
modes, a wait operation is performed for any pending asynchronous data
transfer operations for the specified unit."

[14-007:213:1] A CLOSE statement is allowed to refer to a file that does
not exist, but no semantics are specified for this case.  After "exist"
insert ", exists but is connected to a file that does not exist,"

[14-007:233:18+] Insert a paragraph:

  "Execution of a WAIT statement specifying a unit that is connected to a
  file that does not exist is permitted but has no effect on any pending
  asynchronous input/output operation."

3. Problems for which no edits are provided
===========================================

[14-007:208:32-33] says "The ERR=, IOSTAT=, and IOMSG= specifiers from an
OPEN statement have no effect on any subsequent OPEN statement."  There is
nothing similar for any other statement.  It is inscrutable why it is
specified at all, and double inscrutable that it is specified for the case
when an OPEN statement is specified for a unit that is connected to the
file specified.  If this is necessary it should be specified for every
statement (not just I/O statements).

[14-007:236:6-7] says "All specifier value assignments are performed
according to the rules for assignment statements."  There is nothing
similar for any other statement.  If this is necessary it should
be specified for every statement (not just I/O statements).

The INQUIRE statement is allowed to refer to a unit that does not exist, a
unit that is not connected, or a unit that exists but is connected to a
file that does not exist.  No semantics are specified for these cases.
