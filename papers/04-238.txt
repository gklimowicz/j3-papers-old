Subject: Implied DO scope

The scope of an <ac-do-variable> can't very well be "its
<data-implied-do>".  This looks like an error made in
changing the sentence to use bnf (which did clarify a
separate possible confusion in the f95 words).

Suggested edit to theh FCD

  [409:18] Insert "or <ac-implied-do>" before the period.
