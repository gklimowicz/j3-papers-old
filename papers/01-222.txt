Subject: BOZ Constants


BOZ constants have been promoted to full-fledged
literal constants in the F2K draft. For example,
this means that the following program:
      PROGRAM MAIN
        DATA X/Z'3F800000'/
        Y = Z'3F800000'
        PRINT *, X, Y
      END

Will not print 1.0 1.0 (assuming ieee 32-bit
arithmetic).

This is a change in behavior for most, if
not all, vendor's compilers.

Sun proposes the following edit:

[35:6+] Add the paragraph:

A /boz-literal-constant/ shall not appear in a context
that would cause its value to be converted to a type
other than INTEGER.
