NUMBER: F18/025
TITLE: Is component initialization an attribute?
KEYWORDS: Component initialization, SEQUENCE, Generic
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in program

QUESTION:

Consider
  MODULE m1
    TYPE t
      SEQUENCE
      INTEGER :: a = 1
    END TYPE
  END MODULE
  MODULE m2
    TYPE t
      SEQUENCE
      INTEGER :: a = 999
    END TYPE
  END MODULE
  MODULE m
    USE m1,t1=>t
    USE m2,t2=>t
  END MODULE

The normative text on attributes states:
    "Every data object has a type and rank and can have ... other
     properties that determine the uses of the object. Collectively,
     these properties are the attributes of the object."
It does seem that default initialization of components determines the
uses of an object, but there is no clear statement either way that
specifies that it is or is not an attribute. Obviously, it cannot
appear in an attribute specification statement, but then, none of the
attributes of a component can appear there.

Q. Is component initialization an attribute? This affects type
   equivalence, and thus generic resolution and pure procedure
   semantics.

For example,
    PROGRAM test1
      USE m
      TYPE(t1) :: x = t1(0)
      CALL sub(x) ! Has INTENT(OUT), therefore
      PRINT *,x   ! we expect x%a to be now equal to 1.
    END PROGRAM
    SUBROUTINE sub(y)
      USE m
      TYPE(t2),INTENT(OUT) :: y
      PRINT *,y   ! We expect y%a to be now equal to 999.
    END SUBROUTINE
This is only a valid program if type T1 is considered to be the same
as T2, i.e. if component initialization is not an attribute. But then,
is X%A initialised to 1 at the CALL, or to 999 on entry to SUB?
Whichever, it seems the user will be surprised.

Similarly, if component initialization is an attribute, then
    MODULE mg
      USE m
      INTERFACE s
        MODULE PROCEDURE s1,s2
      END INTERFACE
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s1(a)
        TYPE(t1) a
        ...
      END SUBROUTINE
      SUBROUTINE s2(a)
        TYPE(t2) a
        ...
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE
would specify a valid generic interface, but if it is not an attribute
the module M2 is not valid.

Finally, if component initialization is not an attribute, it might
circumvent restrictions aimed at preventing side-effects of pure
procedures, for example:
    MODULE safe
      REAL,TARGET :: x
      TYPE t
        SEQUENCE
        REAL,POINTER :: p
      END TYPE
    END MODULE
    MODULE bad
      USE safe,ONLY:x
      TYPE t
        SEQUENCE
        REAL,POINTER :: p => x
      END TYPE
    END MODULE
    MODULE unsafe
    CONTAINS
      PURE SUBROUTINE s(a,b)
        USE safe,ONLY:t1=>t
        USE bad,ONLY:t2=>t
        REAL,INTENT(OUT) :: a
        REAL,INTENT(IN) :: b
        TYPE(t1) oops
        oops = t2() ! Only valid if component init not an attr.
        oops%p = a  ! And then this modifies a global variable.
        a = b
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

ANSWER:

Component initialization was intended to be an attribute.
An edit is provided to clarify this ambiguity.

ALTERNATIVE ANSWER:

Component initialization was not intended to be an attribute. An edit
is provided to clarify this ambiguity. Note that interp F18/019 might
need a stricter answer to ensure the safety of pure procedures.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[69:7] 7.5.2.4 Determination of derived types, p2,
       After "attributes"
       insert "(including any default initialization)".
{Make it clear that default initialization is considered to be an
 attribute for the purposes of type equivalence.}

ALTERNATIVE EDIT:

[69:7] After "attributes."
       Insert "Default initialization of a component is not considered
               to be an attribute for this purpose."
{Make it clear that default initialization is not considered to be an
 attribute for the purposes of type equivalence.}
