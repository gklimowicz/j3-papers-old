Subject: Fix constraint C528

Discussion:

The current constraint C528 omits objects with co-array components,
and is not updated for the new SAVE/Module rules.

Edit for J3/07-007

[91:9-10] Replace C528 with:

"The SAVE attribute shall be specified for a co-array or an object
with a co-array ultimate component unless it is a dummy argument,
declared in the main program, declared in the specification part of a
module, or allocatable."
