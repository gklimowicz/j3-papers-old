Subject:  Edits incorporated in 99-007R2


This paper describes the changes in J3/99-007R2 relative to the previous
f2k draft, J3/99-007R1.  All page/line references are to J3/99-007R1
unless otherwise noted.

All of the changes mentioned in this paper have been done in the draft.
Although there may be some questions raised below, they do not
necessarily require action in my opinion.

Those issues which I believe to require action have been put into a
separate paper of unresolved issues for addition to the 011 document.
This was done to help highlight and track the items requiring action.

Ths change bars in 99-007R2 are relative to 99-007R1

Misc editorial/typo fixes not included in passed papers.

  [21:5] "described via" -> "described by"

  [43:23]  Italicized component-def-stmt.

  [140:27] Not obviously wrong, but the difference in wording choice
    for otherwise identical statements bothered me, so I changed the
    "any.....or" phrasing here to "each....and" just like the
    corresponding statements for constant and initialization
    expressions.

  Moved Table 2.1 to the end of section 2.3.2 instead of before it.
  Its more appropriate where I moved it to anyway.  I think the
  only reason it was placed before 2.3.2 was for better pagination,
  but the pagination now works better with it where it belongs anyway.

  [261:42] "may appear in no" -> "shall not appear in any"

paper 99-125r2, iostat_end and iostat_eor, with the following changes

  In the c9 edit, xrefed the specific sections for the 2 constants,
  rather than the section 1 level higher.

paper 99-131r2, issue 15, as is

paper 99-140r2, issue 191, with the following changes

  Deleted redundant "shall" from item 5.
  Fixed list syntax.

paper 99-143r2, Observations concerning section 12, as is

paper 99-146r3, issue 9, as is

paper 99-147r2, issue 143, as is

paper 99-148r2, issue 16, with the following changes

  Omitted the word "clause" from the edit at 269:6.  We don't define
  the term and this sentence seemed clear enough just omitting it.

  Added a comma at the end of the 269:12 edit.

paper 99-149r1, issue 35, as is

paper 99-150r1, issues 77 and 131-133, as is

paper 99-151r1, issue 139, as is

paper 99-156r1, misc edits, with the following changes

  I worked from a copy of r0, with the R1 changes hand-marked;
  might be worth checking that I got them right.

  In particular, I'm not entirely sure that I got the R1 changes on
  page 41 straight.  My markup says to just delete the unresolved
  issue 146 here, but to make no changes in the constraint that it
  refers to.  I recall discussion about this constraint, and I recall
  that someone found a more general constraint that makes at least
  most of this one redundant, but I don't recall whether we decided to
  make any change in this one or not.  I'm just deleting the
  unresolved issue and leaving the constraint as is, according to my
  markup of what I think was passed.

  The subsequently-passed 99-168r1 seems to answer the need
  mentioned in the proposed J3 note about needing the intro
  updated to reflect f2k.  Thus I just omitted that note rather
  than adding and resolving it in the same batch of edits.

  Added "(Interoperability with C)" after "Section 16" in the
  intro, following the style of the other section descriptions.

  "declared" -> "defined" before "by means other than Fortran".
  That's the terminology we use elsewhere.

  Reordered phrases in the sentence at 291:13 to avoid the awkward
  comma use.

  In the edit at 292:19, "defined by" -> "described by".  We don't
  really consider a prototype to define a function, do we?

paper 99-157r2, select type, with the following changes

  Added a "The" to the 2nd edit to avoid beginning sentence with bnf.

paper 99-158r1, IEEE, with the following changes

  Note that the edit at 385:37 is superseded by paper 99-167r1.

  Used lower case for "public" in item 4.  One could probably justify
  either usage, but we seem to (mostly) use it in lower case in
  contexts like this.

paper 99-159r1, recursive I/O, as is

paper 99-160r1, fixups to 16.2.6, with the following changes

  Ignored the typos on the first page of the paper and worked only
  from the edits on the second page.

  In the new note, "VALUE" -> "The VALUE attribute".

  Also "cannot" -> "may not" insomuch as it certainly is *possible*
  to do so; we just disallow it.

  Just use the section number without the word "section" in xrefs.

  "as" -> "because".  I assume that is the sense meant.  The sense
  "like" would also have been plausible but would mean something
  entirely different (and wrong insomuch as Fortran allows copy in/out
  for arrays).

  "in C arrays" -> "arrays in C".

  I'm dubious of the choice of tense in the note.  "would have been"
  and "to have permitted"?  Present tense would seem more consistent
  to me.  But I entered it as specified.  And my misgivings weren't
  serious enough to justify a J3 note.

paper 99-162, issue 76, as is

paper 99-163r1, issue 130, with the following changes

  Spelled "nonexecutable" the same way both times (without a hyphen).

paper 99-164r1, issue 44, as is

paper 99-165r1, IEEE cont., with the following changes

  "An" -> "A" in edit 15.  Also don't italicize the second usage of
  "intrinsic" in the entry - just the first.  (twice).

  I think the statement that was added as the 2nd para of 11.3
  might be better put as a 3rd para of 13.0.  But I left it as
  specified.  I don't feel strongly enough about it to make a J3 note.
  Still, if others agree, I'd suggest moving it.

  While making the specified index changes, I also singularized the
  plural entry.  Singular is usually preferred.  I see that the index
  does have several apparently random and inconsistent uses of plural,
  but I didn't try to change them all - just the one I was editing
  anyway.

  My notes about the R1 changes were unclear about which of 2 versions
  we ended up passing for the words of note 15.1.  I used the version
  that seemed best to me, though either version seems acceptable as a
  note.

paper 99-166, issue 10, as is

paper 99-167r2, more IEEE, with the following changes

  Used "colonial" spelling of "inquiring".

  "the" -> "that" in 2nd mention of IEEE standard, since other IEEE
  standards exist and the intro can't depend on section 1.8, where we
  state our use of the term "the IEEE standard".

  The R1 seems to have accidentally lost the instructions on what to
  do with the item labeled (5a).  I found those instructions in the R0
  and added this item at [143:23+].

  "the reals are supported with IEEE arithmetic" ->
  "the processor supports IEEE arithmetic for default real"
  Because thats the form of wording used in IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE.
  Also because I'm not sure what "the reals" means; I know that
  "default real" means the right thing.

  "other values" ->
  "values that are not in one of these exceptional classes"
  to avoid possible confusion in interpreting "other".

  I did the deletion specified by edit 25.  I don't know how to do
  it "subject the approval of WG5" unless perhaps that meant to
  wait until WG5 approved before doing it.  (The whole document
  is, after all, subject to the approval of WG5).  Presumably if
  WG5 disapproves of this edit, the sentence in question can be
  added back in (which is easy enough to do).

  Did the overflow change only on the last of the 3 occurances
  on [402:15].

  Also did simillar overflow/underflow changes on 388:22, 392:8, 392:11.

paper 99-168r1, foreward, with the following changes

  This paper seems to have been reformatted with different line breaks
  than the text from 99-007r1, so it is more trouble than it is worth
  to use a tool like diff to find where the actual changes are.  I did
  only the parts where I noticed that there were changes.  No promise
  that I got them all.  In fact, my second pass through found several
  that I missed the first time.  I didn't do a third pass.

  In the 5th para of the forward, "third" -> "fourth",
  "second" -> "third", and "1991" -> "1997".

  One of the other papers added foreword material on IEEE, presumably
  answering the request for that, so I did not insert that J3 note.

paper 99-169r1, section 1, with the following changes

  Omitted "or an interface body" from the last sentence of 1.5.1.  It
  doesn't fit sensibly and looks like a typo in the R1.

  According to my notes, the "part 3" edits (on f90 and f77
  compatability) were not approved, largely because the exact edits
  reflecting the straw vote were not available to vote on.  However,
  it does look like the R1 incorporates the results of the straw vote
  about the general direction preferred for this material.  Therefore,
  I've gone ahead and put these edits in on the theory that they will
  be closer than what we had before.

  Omitted "the Fortran International Standard," before the references
  to F90 and F77.  Without any qualifiers, I read this phrasing
  implied that F90 was the current standard.  (The simillar phrases in
  the F95 intro had the words "previous" and "earlier", which made
  them read entirely differently).

  Used lower case for "standard".  I've never really figured out why
  this sometimes seems to be capitalized - it doesn't look like a
  proper noun to me.

  Consistently used "this standard" instead of "the Fortran 2000 standard".

  Omitted "note however that", changed the semicolon to a sentence end,
  and moved the para break by one sentence - i.e. used the same wording
  as in 1.5.1.

  Omitted the "as recommended in the Fortran 90 standard with regard to
  nonintrinsic procedures."  I'm not sure why we'd use those words here,
  but not in the otherwise identical phrase in 1.5.1.  Likewise, omitted
  simillar words in 1.5.3(4).

paper 99-170, editor's edits, with the following changes

  "a" included in the text to replace at [202:35]

paper 99-161r1, index entries, with the following changes

  Added modifiers to lots of the entries.  For example,
  "BINDNAME= specifier" instead of just "BINDNAME=".
  Similarly used "function", "attribute", and perhaps some
  other modifiers - too much trouble to list them all.

  Used the specified page numbers as a rough guide, in conjunction
  with Frame's search.

  I made an entry for "C address", but without the quotes.

  C-type isn't strictly a bnf term.  At a little loss what to do
  instead, I considered indexing C_*, but decided that notation
  would need definition, perhaps just C_.  Ended up using
  C_(C type), as we do use parens elsewhere in the index for
  elaboration.

  Simillar conundrum for IEEE, where I settled on just IEEE_.

  "child data transfer input/output statement" seems like a pretty big
  mouthful for an index entry; it won't even fit on one line of the
  index.  True, that's what is bold faced, but should it be?  We
  freely refer to data transfer statements all over, without feeling
  the need to qualify them further as data transfer input/output
  statements; there is even a section title of just "Data transfer
  statements".  Although we define the long-winded term "child data
  transfer input/output statement", I see that the usage switches
  randomly between that full form, "child data transfer statement",
  and "child input/output statement".  Simillarly with "parent", where
  we also use the term "parent input/output procedure".  Note that we
  never have child/parent i/o statements other than data transfer
  ones.  I changed all of these various forms to use "child(or parent)
  data transfer statement".  I then used that form in the index.

  "currently allocated" doesn't seem like something people would likely
  look for.  (Perhaps under "allocated", but I wouldn't imagine people
  looking under "currently").  And the cited place in the allocated
  intrinsic isn't a definition.  That would probably be someplace in
  section 6, I suspect (but didn't look).  Omitted this one.

  I'm not sure that I follow the rationale for indexing 3 intrinsic
  functions in c13 (extends_type_of, same_type_as, and
  get_environment_variable), while not indexing the other 100+ ones.
  So I didn't.  Once a reader knows the name of an intrinsic, its
  about as easy to find in the alphabetical listing as in the index.
  I could see some index entries by concept as possibly being more
  helpful than just all the intrinsic names (maybe that's just an
  excuse for me being to lazy to enter all 100+ of them).

  I omitted the entry for "flexible array member".  The only thing we
  ever say about them is that Fortran does *NOT* interoperate with
  them (or with bit fields or unions, neither of which we index).

  I agree that ISO10646 *OUGHT* to have a defining entry in c4, but
  it doesn't (yet).  The only reference to it in c4 now is in a J3 note
  saying that it needs to be mentioned.  I don't think there is much
  point in indexing things in J3 notes.  I did add an index entry for
  ISO 10464 (and for ASCII) pointing to the selected_char_kind
  intrinsic in c13.

  I figured it wasn't necessary to separately index two different forms
  of the same root word.  Indexed both "interoperate" and "interoperation"
  under "interoperate".

  I indexed "linkage" rather than "object linkage".  (Of course, since
  we use the same term for 2 completely unrelated things, the terminology
  may well change anyway).
