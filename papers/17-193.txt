From:       David Muxworthy
Subject:    Informal name of the revised language
Date: 2017 September 21

Discussion:
----------

The following was discussed as a proposal for the UK vote on the
second CD.  It gained near-unanimous support but as we operate by
consensus it was not included in the final vote.  This is to bring it
to the attention of J3 for information and possible action.

Proposal:
--------

The language should renamed Fortran 2017 since it has developed
incrementally over the past two years and it is no longer true that
the final definition took place in 2015.

Rationale:
---------

We have had:

content     informal  published
finalized   name

1990        90        1991
1996        95        1997
2004        03        2004
2010        08        2010

A three-year gap is looking too far backwards and would make it look
as if the language were out of date already.  Fortran already suffers
in some quarters from the perception that it exists only as a legacy
language and to publish Fortran 2015 in 2018 could even attract
derision.

Other comments arising during the discussion were to use Fortran 2018,
Fortran 2020 (the language for the future) or to use a naming scheme
without a year in it.
