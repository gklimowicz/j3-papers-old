Subject: Comment on IEEE_VALUE --- revision of 06-253


The IEEE Standard allows a processor to convert a signaling NaN to a
quiet NaN if it is involved in an operation.  This compromises the
functionality of IEEE_VALUE.  The standard should recommend that
producing the function result should not be considered to be an
operation.

EDITS:

Insert a new paragraph and note at [462:10+] in 06-007r1:
"Whenever IEEE_VALUE returns a signaling NaN, it is 
processor dependent whether or not invalid is raised and processor 
dependent whether or not the signaling NaN is converted into a quiet NaN."

  "NOTE 14.12a
If the <expr> in an assignment statement is a reference to the IEEE_VALUE 
function that returns a signaling NaN and the <variable> is of the same type 
and kind as the function result, it is recommended that the signaling NaN be 
preserved."
