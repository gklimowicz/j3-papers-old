Subject: Comment GB48 on TS 29113
From: Bill Long

Discussion:

UK comment GB48 proposes to delete the text in A.2.1 starting with
"The following example provides..." and through the end of the A.2.1.

Justification: The example of copying a possibly-noncontiguous array
to a contiguous buffer is hard to understand and has poor performance.



Edits to N1869:

In A.2.1, delete the text starting with "The following example
provides..." and through the end of the A.2.1.
