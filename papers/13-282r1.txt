Subject: An EVENT POST statement and segment order
Date:    27 June 2013
References: N1967

Discussion: 
~~~~~~~~~~~

Execution of an EVENT POST statement defines <event-variable>.  The
segment that contains the statement is unordered relative to the
execution of the EVENT POST statement.

Edits to N1967:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[27:12] Insert the following after line 12:

"{Replace the first sentence of 8.5.2 p3 with the following}

'A coarray may be referenced or defined by execution of an atomic
subroutine during the execution of a segment that is unordered
relative to the execution of a segment in which the coarray is
referenced or defined by execution of an atomic subroutine. A coarray
that is of type EVENT_TYPE may be referenced or defined during the
execution of a segment that is unordered relative to the execution of
another segment in which that coarray of type EVENT_TYPE is defined.'
