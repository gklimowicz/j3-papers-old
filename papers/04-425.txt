1.  Monday, November 8, 2004

1.1 Opening business - D. Nagle [minutes kindness of D. Hendrickson]

    The meeting was called to order at 8:00 AM, Monday, November
    8, 2004, at the Las Vegas Emerald Suites by the chair, Dan
    Nagle.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair - D. Nagle

    1)  Paper 404 is the liaison charge, for Nagle to H2 (SQL).  Does
        anybody else want to do it?  If not, we'll act on this during
        comments from members.

    2)  754R has changed some terminology used to describe DENORMs.
        We should check it and patch our words to match theirs.  There
        is a UK repository item about this.

    3)  Do we want to communicate with any of the grid computing
        communities, or MPI, about bindings to Fortran?  E.g. the MPI
        binding does not use many of the F90+ features.  If so, does
        anybody want to volunteer?

    4)  Questions about paper formats allowed.  We require either text
        or postscript, and allow others as desired to supplement.
        Should we standardize on PDF or should we allow it as an
        option?  Are there others as well?  HTML?, etc.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda - D. Nagle

**  motion: adopt the agenda (moved by Snyder/seconded by Long):
            passed by unanimous consent (uc)

    The agenda is in Appendix A.

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 169 minutes - D. Nagle

**  motion: approve meeting #169 minutes paper 04-375 (James/
            Long):  uc

1.1.4 INCITS/OMC report (if any) - D. Nagle

    Next report due in April, therefore it won't include the WG5
    meeting results.  It will state that F2003 is out the door.
    Dan is trying to find out how to liaison with the informal
    committees (MPI, etc.)

1.1.5 ISO/WG5 report - V. Snyder, IR

    Nothing to report

1.1.6 J11 Liaison report (if any) - C. Rasmussen

    No report

    B. Long comments: Cray J11 member said that the J3 paper
    did arrive and two J11 members will look at it.

1.1.7 IEEE 754 report (if any) - M. Ingrassia

    No report

    M. Cohen comments:  Nothing definite to report, they are
    getting closer to deadline, so more things are happening.
    Ballot of 754R should start soon.  Still several controversial
    items.  Subgroups working on those.  Seem to be making progress.
    Not clear yet how things will affect us.

1.1.8 Treasurer's report - M. North

    All bills from last meeting are paid.
    The opening balance is $1870.53
    The meeting fee for this meeting is $50

1.1.9 Beginning membership report - S. Whitlock

    Total membership at the beginning of this meeting is 11, with
    8 members present or represented, and 1 non-voting alternate
    present

    The following have missed 2 of the last 3 letter ballots:

      .  Rich Bleikamp {no vote received on #8 and #9}
      .  Michael Ingrassia {no vote received on #7 and #9}

      Missing 2 out of 3 puts them in jeopardy.  S. Whitlock
      will send them a reminder via e-mail.

    The following have missed 1 of the last 3 letter ballots:

      .  Dick Hendrickson {no vote received on #8}

    See Appendix E for further details

1.1.10 Local arrangements - M. North

    Nothing recorded

1.1.11 Comments from members

**  motion: 04-404: charge to D. Nagle as H2 Liaison
            (Nagle/Long): uc

    M. North:  We have a request from Craig Dedo, asking to be
    put on all J3 e-mail lists.  Current web arrangement
    automatically drops people from the lists after 5 (or 10?)
    bounced e-mails.  There are many people on the different
    lists that don't appear to be current or recent members.
    Should we edit down the lists?

    D. Nagle:  Members-only list is restricted by NCITS to be
    only J3 members, alternates, liaisons, and WG5 officers.
    US-TAG list is J3 members who are US company representatives.
    We'll cut back to Members-only and US-Tag.

    M. North:  About the Web site.  Wants suggestions for
    improvements, changes, etc.  Give him written comments

    Discussion of standing documents and the need to update them on
    a consistent basis.  We need to assign responsibility for each
    document and keep them up to date.

    Action item, verify that these are correct for the standing
    documents:
