Subject:  RFI's from Robert Corbett

----------------------------------------------------------------------
We have not been doing intepretation work, whilst grinding on f95. 
As a result, I've been holding onto these RFI's from Robert
Corbett. He has reminded me of this. He would like formal responses. I
believe that these references continue to hold for our f95
document. Answers against f95 should be sufficient.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The fifth paragraph of Section 10.8.2 of the Fortran 90
    standard clearly indicates that in list-directed output
    zero must be formatted according to exponential format.
    Most, though not all, of the implementations I tried use
    fixed format.  Even the FCVS test suite assumes fixed
    format.  Should exponential format be used for zero in
    list-directed output?

2.  The same issue raised in question 1 applies to namelist
    output (see Section 10.9.2.1, paragraph 3).  Should
    exponential format be used for zero in namelist output?

3.  The seventh paragraph of Section 10.8.2 of the Fortran 90
    standard states that complex numbers must be written with
    no embedded blanks unless the complex constant is broken
    across two records..  Some of the implementations I
    tested put a blank after the comma even when the entire
    constant fit in a single record.  Is an implementation
    permitted to include a blank after the comma in a complex
    constant produced by list-directed output when the
    constant fits in a single record?

4.  Is a blank permitted after the comma in a complex constant
    produced by namelist output when the constant fits in a
    signle record?

5.  The first paragraph of Section 10.8.2 of the Fortran 90
    standard states

        With the exception of adjacent nondelimited
        character constants, the values are separated
        by one or more blanks or by a comma optionally
        preceded by one or more blanks and optionally
        followed by one or more blanks.

    I have yet to find a Fortran implementation, other than
    my own, that satisfies this requirement.  In particular,
    the statement

        PRINT *, 1, ',' 2

    prints a comma immediately following the 1 on every
    implementation I tried.  The comma was followed by zero,
    one, or two blanks in different implementations.

    Is a separator required between a constant other than
    a nondelimited character constant and a following
    nondelimited character constant in list-directed output?

    Is a separator required between a nondelimited character
    constant and a following constant that is not a
    nondelimited character constant?
