Discussion
----------

When J3 added conditional arguments, it added both <consequent-arg> and 
<conditional-arg> as new meanings for the term "actual argument". We 
agree with the addition of <consequent-arg>, which plays the same role 
as <actual-arg> does in Fortran 2018. However, a <conditional-arg> is 
not an object so we feel that it is not appropriate to give it 
properties that objects have including type, kind type parameters, and 
rank, see para 4 of 15.5.2.3. 

Note that at the end of para 2 of the 22-007r1 introduction we have
"Conditional arguments provide actual argument selection in a
procedure reference."

We propose the removal of <conditional-arg> as a possibility for
<actual-arg> in R1524 while in the definition of "actual argument" in
3.1 retaining the text "An <actual-arg>, <consequent-arg>, or <variable> 
in a defined assignment statement, are all examples of actual arguments." 
This will require the introduction of a new syntax term <actual-arg-def> 
for the present meaning of <actual-arg> (what appears in an actual 
argument list). 

Note that this does not remove the property of generic resolution being 
independent of the choice of a <consequent-arg>. 15.4.3.4.5 Restrictions 
on generic declarations, para 3 states
Two dummy arguments are distinguishable if
   o one is a procedure and the other is a data object,
     [A <consequent-arg> cannot be a procedure.]
   o they are both data objects or known to be functions, and neither 
     is TKR compatible with the other,
     [C1538 says "Each consequent-arg of a conditional-arg shall have 
     the same declared type, and kind type parameters."
     C1539 says "Either all consequent-args in a conditional-arg shall 
     have the same rank, or be assumed-rank."]
   o one has the ALLOCATABLE attribute and the other has the POINTER 
     attribute and not the INTENT (IN) attribute,
     [C1545 says "In a reference to a generic procedure, ... , and if 
     any consequent-arg of a conditional-arg has the ALLOCATABLE or 
     POINTER attribute, each consequent-arg shall have that attribute."
   or
   o one is a function with nonzero rank and the other is not known 
     to be a function.
     [A <consequent-arg> cannot be a procedure.]

 
Suggested edits follow.

[317:22] In 15.5.1 Syntax of a procedure reference, in R1523, change
"actual-arg" to "actual-arg-def" so that the rule becomes
     R1523 actual-arg-spec is [ keyword = ] actual-arg-def

[317:22+] In 15.5.1 Syntax of a procedure reference, after R1523, add 
     R1523a actual-arg-def <is> actual-arg
                           <or> conditional-arg

[317:27] In 15.5.1 Syntax of a procedure reference, in R1524, delete line
                           <or> conditional-arg

[320:7] In 15.5.2.3 Conditional argument correspondence, first sentence 
change "actual-arg" to "actual-arg-def" so that the sentence becomes
"If an actual-arg-def is a conditional-arg, each scalar-logical-expr is 
evaluated in order, until the value of a scalar logical-expr is true, 
or there are no more scalar-logical-exprs."

[320:12-13, 17-20] In 15.5.2.3 Conditional argument correspondence, 
delete the final sentence of para 2 (which should have been added to
para 4) and the whole of para 4.
