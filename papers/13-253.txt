   Bill is working on the module for MPICH2;  Craig Rasmussen is working
   on it for OpenMPI.  Unfortunately it still uses default integer.

   MPI 4 work continues on resiliency - some processes failing doesn't
   crash the entire application.

   support for F2003 and for coprocessors {OMP TARGET}.

   are listed in the table below as column 1.

   Excerpts from the RD-2

     4.3.4 Quorum
       Quorum for INCITS and its subgroups is defined accordingly:
         a. For the Executive Board, quorum is a majority of the
            voting membership.
         b. For SGs there is no minimum attendance required for quorum.
         c. For all other INCITS Organization Entities, quorum is
            one-third of the voting membership with at least four
            voting members present.

     4.4.2.2 2/3 Voting Rule
       The 2/3 voting rule is defined as:
         • approval by at least 2/3 of those voting YES or NO, and
         • approval by a majority of the voting membership. That
           threshold is not affected by the number of members
           present at the meeting for a meeting vote.

   At this meeting:
     • Total membership is 7
     • A quorum is 4
