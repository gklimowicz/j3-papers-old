NUMBER: F08/0040
TITLE:  MOVE_ALLOC for coarrays
KEYWORDS: intrinsic, allocation
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Was it intended that MOVE_ALLOC be applicable to coarrays?

ANSWER:

Yes.  A call to MOVE_ALLOC on coarrays might involve the deallocation
of a coarray, therefore MOVE_ALLOC needs to be an image control
statement.

Also, the corank of FROM and TO needs to be the same.

Edits are supplied to correct this.

DISCUSSION:

It might appear that C541 which says
  "An entity with the INTENT(OUT) attribute shall not be an
   allocatable coarray ..."
might prohibit MOVE_ALLOC from operating on coarrays; however, this
constraint applies to user-defined procedure not to intrinsic
procedures: that is, the dummy arguments of MOVE_ALLOC do not
technically have corank.

An edit is supplied to clarify C541.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[97:13] In 5.3.10 INTENT attribute,
  Change "entity"
  to "dummy argument of a nonintrinsic procedure".
{Clarify the constraint.}

[188:23+] In 8.5.1 Image control statements, paragraph 2,
          insert new bullet point before the STOP statement one,
  "- a CALL statement that invokes the intrinsic subroutine MOVE_ALLOC
     with coarray arguments;"

[372:19] In 13.7.118p3 MOVE_ALLOC, TO argument,
         After "same rank" insert "and corank".

[372:29+] 13.7.118, p6+
  Insert new paragraph immediately before "Example:"
    "When a reference to MOVE_ALLOC is executed for which the FROM
     argument is a coarray, there is an implicit synchronization of
     all images.  On each image, execution of the segment (8.5.2)
     following the CALL statement is delayed until all other images
     have executed the same statement the same number of times."
