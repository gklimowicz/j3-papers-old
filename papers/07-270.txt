Discussion

The requirement that the leading argument to a collective subroutine
is a co-array while the result argument is not a co-array is not
symmetric and seems somewhat arbitrary. Likely implementations would
require remote access to both arguments during execution of the
subroutine (a fan-in reduction on the input argument and a fan-out
broacast to the result). Performance would be optimal if both are
co-arrays, assuming the processor implements optimized mechanisms for
accessing remote co-arrays. Since we currently allow the result to not
be a co-array, the subroutine has to be able to handle that case. It
should be able to handle a non-co-array as the input argument as well.
If the argument is not a co-array, then it is not even necessary to
require that the effective argument be the same variable on each
image. The actual argument could, for example, be a pointer with
different targets on different images.  Allowing non-co-array
arguments will simplify the incremental addition of co-arrays to an
existing MPI program.

These restrictions are needed independent of whether the arguments are
co-arrays:

1) The shape of the leading and result arguments shall be the same.

2) The shape, type, and type parameters of the leading argument
   shall be the same on all images of the team. Similarly for the
   result argument.

To take advantage of high performance versions of the collectives,
this restriction is needed on co-array arguments:

3) If an actual leading or result argument is a co-array, then the
   corresponding ultimate argument shall be the same object on
   every image of the team.

For collective subroutines that have an argument named CO_ARRAY,
that name should be changed to SOURCE.


Edits to 07-007r2:

----------------
Edits to '13.2.4 Arguments to collective subroutines':

[354:19] In the first sentence, replace "shape" with "shape, type, and
type parameters".

[354:22] In the last sentence, replace "of the co-array dummy
argument" with "of a leading or result dummy argument that corresponds
to a co-array actual argument".

-----------------
Edits to '13.7.43 CO_SUM (CO_ARRAY, RESULT [, TEAM])':

[381:35] In subclause title, replace "CO_ARRAY" with "SOURCE". Make the
same change in Table 13.1 (page 358).

[381:39, 41, 42; 382:1, 3, 7, 9] replace all occurrences of "CO_ARRAY"
in the subclause with "SOURCE".

[381:39] In the description of the first 'Argument', delete "a
co-array".

-----------------
Similar edits for the other Collective Subroutine descriptions.
