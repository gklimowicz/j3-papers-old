NUMBER: F18/0xx
TITLE:  Scalar argument for assumed-type assumed-size dummy argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Paragraph 14 of 15.5.2.4 Ordinary dummy variables states

If the actual argument is a noncoindexed scalar, the corresponding dummy 
argument shall be scalar unless
  o ... ,
  o ... , or
  o the dummy argument is an assumed-type assumed-size array.
  
This would allow an array that is not contiguous to be associated with 
an assumed-type assumed-size array. Was this intended? 

ANSWER:

This was not intended. The first bullet of the paragraph, which reads
  o the actual argument is default character, of type character with 
    the C character kind (18.2.2), or is an element or substring of an 
    element of an array that is not an assumed-shape, pointer, or 
    polymorphic array,
should apply when the dummy argument is an assumed-type assumed-size 
array. An edit is provided to correct this.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[306:6-8] 15.5.2.4 Ordinary dummy variables, para 14, remove bullet 3
and move "or" from bullet 2 to bullet 1, so that the para reads

If the actual argument is a noncoindexed scalar, the corresponding 
dummy argument shall be scalar unless
   o the actual argument is default character, of type character with 
     the C character kind (18.2.2), or is an element or substring of an 
     element of an array that is not an assumed-shape, pointer, or  
     polymorphic array, or
   o the dummy argument has assumed-rank.
