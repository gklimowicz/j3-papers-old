Subject: Types allowed in EXTENDS

A parent type can currently be any accessible extensible type.  In
most other contexts, a derived type must be defined before its use
(pointers are the only exception I can think of).  I believe that this
use of a type was likely meant to be restricted in the same way.  It
is likely that this was a modified version of C476 when it should have
been a modified version of C438.

Proposed edits to the Fortran 2003 FCD:
--------------------------------------- 

[45:17] Change "accessible" to "previously defined".
