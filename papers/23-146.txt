HPC proposed features for F202Y
-------------------------------

1) BITS data 
   - Adds an intrinsic type BITS to Fortran with a KIND-type parameter
     indicating the  number of bits in the data item.
     Was included in the later (but not final) 007 files
     Fortran 2008, so much of the design work is done.
     Would require some integration
     as some features were added separately. 

2) Simple templates.
   Reuse a lot of existing language features, extended.
   Add a new Prefix, "template" to a subroutine or Function,
     to create a template proc.
   Allow template procs to have dummy arguments that are assumed-type,
   assumed-rank, and assumed-kind (new).
   Require that template procs be defined in a MODULE or as a internal
   subprogram
      (lets the compiler find them).
   Instantiation happens a call/reference sites.
   Error messages if an operation is attempted that is not
     supported for the actual type. 
   Reuse some of the C++ template technology (name mangling, for example).
   
3) Double operators
   Support A+-B that include two consecutive operators.
   For the pattern operand1 op1 op2 operand2
   where op2 is a unary operator for operand 2 and the expression value is
   operand1 op1 (op2 operand2).

4) BIND (Fortran, name= )
   Provides a way to specify the binding name for a Fortran program unit.
   Maybe just BIND(name= ).

5) BIND (C++ ....)

6) Support X++ (++X, X-- --X)

7) Add float128, float32, float64 to list of interperable types
   (22-185r1).

8) Async tasking (Jeff, 22-169.pdf)
