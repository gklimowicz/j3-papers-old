Subject:    Comments on Clause 3
References: 16-007r2

[5:6-8 1.2] Move "abstract interface" under 3.93 "interface" , before
3.93.1 "generic interface", at [15:25+].  {There are no other "abstract"
definitions here -- abstract type is 3.150.1; 3.93 includes several
"interface" definitions.}

[10:34 3.47] Delete "object"  because this is not where one would expect
to find this definition {it reappears in the edit for [17:23+] below}.

[17:23+ 3.107+] Insert a definition
"3.107a <<object>>
data object" {as a link}
{This is where one would expect to find "object" if one were not looking
for "data object"}.

[18:20+ 3.115.1] Insert a definition
"3.115.1a <<elemental procedure>>
see 3.67.4" {as a link}
{One might reasonably expect to find this in both places.  The first
(3.67) has several "elemental" definitions; the second (3.115} has
several "procedure" definitions.}

[18:29 3.115.4] Delete "that is" for consistency with other "xyz
procedure" definitions.

[18:42 3.117] Replace the comma with a semicolon.  Replace "and" with ",
representations, or".

[19:25 3.123.2] Insert a comma after "symbol".

[22:27 3.146] Finalization and defined I/O are not operations.  Replace
"or by some operations on" with "finalization, or input/output defined
for".

[25:22 3.157.2] After (either) "thereof" insert ", is not an associate
name".

[Throughout clause 3] Perhaps use "in this document" or "by this
document" consistently; both are presently used.
