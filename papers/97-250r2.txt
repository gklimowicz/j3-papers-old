Subject:	Additional Edits for M.6: Extend Initialization Expressions

References:	X3J3/96-165, J3/97-157, J3/97-208R1

PROPOSAL:

Permit all elemental intrinsic functions in an initialization expression except the math functions ABS(z), ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2, COS, COSH, EXP, LOG, LOG10, SIN, SINH, SQRT, TAN, and TANH, and the corresponding specific intrinsic functions.

PROPOSED ADDITIONAL EDITS:

Note: Edits that were approved at Meeting 142 (August 1997) are shown in document J3/97-007R1 (Sep 1997). Page and line references below are to document J3/97-007R1 (Sep 1997).

[96: 17+] Add NOTE 7.xx:

All elemental intrinsic functions are permitted in an initialization expression except the mathematical generic intrinsic functions ABS (with an argument of complex type), ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2, COS, COSH, EXP, LOG, LOG10, SIN, SINH, SQRT, TAN, and TANH; and the additional mathematical specific intrinsic functions ALOG, ALOG10, CABS, CCOS, CEXP, CLOG, CSIN, CSQRT, DACOS, DASIN, DATAN, DATAN2, DCOS, DCOSH, DEXP, DLOG, DLOG10, DSIN, DSINH, DSQRT, DTAN, and DTANH.

BACKGROUND:

Edits were approved at Meeting 142 (August 1997). The edits in this paper are intended to supply additional informative text.
