From: John Reid
Subject: Replacement for stalling
Date: 2015 February 24

Discussion
----------

In the recent ballot (see N2045), Robert Corbett voted "no" and wrote

"I am still concerned about the features described in Clause 5.9
I understand that allowing stalled images to resume execution
is a desired feature.  I am not convinced that the feature as
described in the DTS can be implemented without imposing a
severe performance penalty.  I understand that the ability to
resume stalled images is an optional feature.  I think that
even an optional feature should be required to be implementable."

Malcolm Cohen also voted *no" saying
"I agree with Robert Corbett's vote."

Van Snyder also voted *no" saying
"I am concerned by Robert Corbett's comments."

In a straw vote, J3 recommended replacing the concept of stalling
by continued execution using a processor-dependent value when a
data object is referenced on a failed image. Another paper removes
the concept of stalling. This paper addresses continued execution.


Edits to N2040:
---------------

[11:4-6] Replace R624 and C509 by
"R624  <image-selector> <<is>> <lbracket> <cosubscript-list> <>
                         <>  [, <team-identifier>] <>
                         <>  [, STAT = <stat-variable>] <rbracket>
R624a <team-identifier> <<is>> TEAM_ID = <scalar-int-expr>
                        <<or>> TEAM = <team-variable>
C509 (R624) <stat-variable> shall not be a coindexed object."
{This replaces the edit for these lines in 15-124.}

[11:14+] Add
"NOTE 5.2a
The use of a STAT=specifier in an image selector allows a test to be
made for a failed image in a reference where the use of a processor-
dependent result could cause error termination or an incorrect
execution path. Where there is no such possibility, it may be
preferable to rely on the STAT=specifier in the next image control
statement.".

[13:21] After "image control statement", add ",a reference to a
coindexed object,".

[13:24] After "image control statement", add " or a reference to a
coindexed object".

[14:12+] Add paragraph

 "Defining a coindexed object on a failed image has no effect other
than defining the <stat-variable>, if one appears, with the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE. The value of an expression that includes a
reference to a coindexed object on a failed image is processor
dependent. Execution continues after such reference.".
