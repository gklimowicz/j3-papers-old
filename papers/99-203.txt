1. Introduction

This paper returns the initial/final status essentially to that of 99-007,
i.e. it removes the facility entirely.  A later paper will add the more
manageable subset that is still required by WG5.

2. Overview of edits

Delete the <binding-id> syntax (R442).

Delete section 4.5.1.5.1 (Initial procedures).

Delete section 4.5.1.5.2 (Final procedures).

Delete section 4.5.6.1 (Intrinsic structure constructors),
re-inserting original text.

Delete section 4.5.6.2 (Defined structure constructors).

Delete section 6.3 (Initialization and Finalization).

Delete back-references throughout the document to 6.3, reinstating the
previous text they replaced (in particular, in 6.4.1.2, 6.4.3.1, 6.4.3.2).

Return 14.7.5 (Events that cause variables to become defined) and
14.7.6 (Events that cause variables to become undefined) to their
previous state.

3. Edits

The edits are based on reversing the effect of paper 99-108r1, with page
and line number references updated from 99-007 to 99-007r2.

The details will appear in the next revision of this paper.
