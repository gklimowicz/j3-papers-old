1. Introduction
---------------

15.5.2.5p3 specifies requirements on the relationship the rank and type
parameters of actual and dummy arguments.  Some of those requirements
are then repeated in 15.5.2.7p3. 15.5.2.6p4 and 15.5.2.7p3 then both say
that the values of assumed type parameters are assumed from
corresponding type parameters of the effective argument.

Since the effect is the same for both allocatable and pointer dummy
arguments, it would be better to say it just once in 15.5.2.5p3.

2. Edits
--------

[320:3 15.5.2.5p3] Move [320:11-12 15.5.2.6p4] to the end of 15.5.2.5p3
at [320:3] (thereby deleting 15.5.2.6p4).

[320:35-38 15.5.2.7p3] Delete 15.5.2.7p3 because it's now covered by
15.5.2.5p3.
