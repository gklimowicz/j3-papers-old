PROPOSAL A  Add an optional lower bound specifier to the left side of the
pointer assignment statement.

(2)  They are specified in a pointer assignment statement.  If a
     <bounds-spec-list> is present, it specifies the lower bound for each
     dimension.  The extent of a dimension of a pointer is the extent of
     the corresponding dimension of the target.  If the lower bound is d
     and the extent of the corresponding dimension of the target is s,
     the value of the upper bound is s + d - 1.  If the lower bounds are
     not specified, the lower bound of each dimension is the result of
     the intrinsic function LBOUND (13.14.53) applied to the correspond-
     ing dimension of the target.  The upper bound of each dimension is
     the result of the intrinsic function UBOUND (13.14.113) applied to
     the corresponding dimension of the target.
