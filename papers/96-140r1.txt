     Date:     August 14, 1996
     To:       X3J3
     From:     Mallory North, X3J3 Librarian
     Subject:  Guidelines for Submitting X3J3 Papers

     The ANSI Fortran Technical committee X3J3 intends to go "total elec-
     tronic" in terms of pre-meeting distribution, post-meeting distribu-
     tion, minutes, and announcements.  The purpose is to minimize (or pos-
     sibly eliminate) costs associated with hard copy reproduction and
     mailing.  All documents would be available via anonymous ftp from the
     server ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu maintained by Kurt Hirchert.

     The following guidelines for submitting papers for consideration by
     X3J3 were considered and approved by X3J3 at Meeting 138, August 12 -
     16, 1996 in Las Vegas, Nevada.  The intent is that these guidelines
     will be distributed electronically to all principal members,
     alternates, observers, liaisons, and correspondents, and implemented
     immediately.  Note that the guidelines are similar to those of WG5 so
     as to maximize compatibility and familiarity with electronic document
     handling and distribution for both organizations.

     1.  Who may submit.

     Any member of X3J3, or any non-member who is interested in contribut-
     ing to the development and standardization of the Fortran scientific
     computing language may submit a paper to X3J3 for consideration.

     2.  When to submit.

     X3J3 requires that papers that are to be considered at a duly schedul-
     ed meeting of the Committee be submitted to the Librarian at least two
     weeks prior to the meeting.  Papers submitted after this time will be
     considered by the Committee as time and work load permit, as long as
     there is no objection to considering such a "late paper".

     3.  Procedure for submitting a paper to X3J3.

     a.  The document will be prepared in an electronic format using either
         an ASCII character text file (e.g. extension .txt) or a PostScript
         file (e.g. extension .ps).  The preferred form is pure ASCII
         character form, especially for rather short papers (less than 10
         pages) that have no graphics and few formatting changes.  It is
         recognized that some papers that are very long (more than 10
         pages), or contain graphics, or contain many formatting changes
         are more appropriately formatted in PostScript form.  If papers
         are prepared in PostScript form, the submitter should output and
         send both the PostScript form and the corresponding ASCII text
         form.  Papers submitted in the prescribed format(s) may also, if
         desired, be submitted in PDF or RTF formats for inclusion on the
         server.

     b.  Before submitting the document to X3J3, the submitter should
         request a paper number from the X3J3 Librarian via either email
         (Charles.M.North@Rose-Hulman.edu) or telephone (812-877-8216).


                                                               X3J3/96-140r1
                                                                Page 2 of 2

         The Librarian will assign a number X3J3/yy-nnnrm where yy stands
         for the year, nnn stands for the paper sequence number, and rm
         stands for the revision number (if any).  The paper number should
         be inserted at the beginning (top) of a document ASCII text (.txt)
         file.  For any document file that is formatted for printing,
         (i.e., PostScript, PDF, or RTF document files) the X3J3 paper
         number and a page number should appear at the top right hand side
         of each page of the document (as shown in this document).

     c.  X3J3 document files should be formatted so that they can be
         printed out conveniently on either A4 (European) or 8.5" x 11"
         (US) paper. The easiest way to do this is to set the margins as
         follows:
                       US                            A4

         Top       0.75 inch (1.91 cm)      1.00 inch (2.54 cm)
         Bottom    0.75 inch (1.91 cm)      1.19 inch (3.30 cm)
         Left      1.00 inch (2.54 cm)      1.00 inch (2.54 cm)
         Right     1.00 inch (2.54 cm)      0.75 inch (1.91 cm)

         If these margins are used for the appropriate size of paper, then
         the printed area will be 9.5" x 6.5", or 24.1 cm x 16.5 cm,
         regardless of the original paper size.  This present paper is
         formatted for US 8.5" x 11" paper as an example.  The document
         should be saved in ASCII form or both PostScript and ASCII forms.
         Do not use fonts other than the standard ones available on
         PostScript printers.  The preferred font is Courier New.

     d.  When the document is completed and contains the assigned paper
         number, the submitter should send the file(s) via email (or via
         mail on a 3.5" floppy disk) to the X3J3 Librarian.  The Librarian
         will check the format and print out one copy of the paper to
         archive and use as an original for reproduction at the meeting if
         needed.  Then the Librarian will archive the electronic file(s) by
         submitting them to the /incoming subdirectory on the server
         ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu for compression by gzip and relocation in the
         appropriate subdirectory by Kurt Hirchert.

     Each time a paper is submitted or revised per the above guidelines and
     stored on the server, the Librarian will update the standing document
     X3J3/yy-000, which is available as the ASCII text file yy-000.txt on
     the server.  The Librarian will also update the server file PAPERS.mmm
     (where mmm is the next X3J3 meeting number), which is a list of the
     papers currently submitted for consideration at X3J3 meeting mmm.
