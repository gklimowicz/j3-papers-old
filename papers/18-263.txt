Subject: Construct association in an ASSOCIATE construct
Date: 2018-October-12

Introduction
============

Note 1 in subclause 19.5.1.6 ([503:0+] in 18-007) says that the
association between an associate name and a data object is not affected
by subsequent changes to variables used in subscript or substring
ranges.

I couldn't find normative support for this.

Edits
=====

[174:30 11.1.3.2p1 Execution of the ASSOCIATE construct] Before "The
associating entity..." insert a sentence:

  "The association is not affected by changes within the block to the
   values of variables used in subscript or substring range expressions
   within the selector."
