Technical questions

[299:7] Add an optional "[::]" after procedure in R1206 for consistency
with other declaration statements containing lists.

[306:34-35] C1220 requires an explicit interface if <proc-language-binding-spec>
is specified. This interface must have BIND(C) in it.
Is it required to have the same NAME= specifier in both the interface and in the
<proc-language-binding-spec>? Or can one add a name in the PROCEDURE statement
if the interface does not have a name?

[314:12+] I find Note 12.27 confusing and misleading. Why is it talking
about the actual argument being defined asynchronously when it is the
dummy that has the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute? Why do we even prohibit copy
in/out when the dummy has asynhronous? Can't the asynchronicity be
confined within the procedure itself. It is really the actual being
modified while the procedure is executing that is the problem.

[327:19] Is C1253 really necessary? We have now enhanced the usability
of internal procedures considerably by allowing them to be called
from outside the host. I envision a conversion of some "callbacks"
into internal procedures. It seems like bad design not to allow
them to have internal subroutines themselves, unless there is an
implementation problem?

[335:14] Can a pure procedure have co-array dummies? Does C1286 apply
to dummy arguments?
