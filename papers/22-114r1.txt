Subject: First Enumerator in an enumeration type should allow a value.
Date: 2022-March-02


Subgroup responses to 22-114:

1.  Subgroup notes that values of an enumeration type cannot be used as
    subscripts at all, whether the lower bound is equal to one or not.
    The traditional enum type (with or without the F202x upgrades) is
    suitable for use in subscripting.

2.  An access-spec has not been allowed on an ENUMERATOR statement for the
    last 18 years. Subgroup agrees that there is no technical reason that
    would prevent such an extension, but at this time it was felt that
    unnecessary extra extensions should be avoided, in the interests of
    keeping things simple. (This revision of the standard was intended to
    be a small revision.) This suggestion would be suitable for
    consideration in a future revision.

3.  Extending enumeration types can indeed be considered in the future.

4.  Subgroup agrees that improving input/output can be done in a future
    revision. This applies to list-directed and namelist formatting, as
    well as to explicit format specifications.

5.  There will be no further action on these suggestions at this time.
