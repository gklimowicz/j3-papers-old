Subject:    INTENT(OUT) dummy arguments of pure subprogram
Reference:  16-007
Date: 2016 January 25

[322:19 C1289] Replace "procedure" with "subprogram".

{The constraint is on the text, i.e., the subprogram, not what is
defined by the subprogram, i.e., the procedure.}

[322:21 C1290] Replace C1290:

"C1290 An INTENT(OUT) dummy argument of a pure subprogram shall not be
       polymorphic or have a polymorphic allocatable potential subobject
       component."

{C1290 was C1278a in Corrigendum 4, where it was incorrect.}

Possible rewording of C1286 and C1289, to make them more explicit:

[322:14-15 C1286]

"C1286 The function result of a pure function shall not have an impure
       final subroutine or have a potential subobject component that has
       an impure final subroutine."

[322:19-20 C1289] Replace C1289

"C1289 An INTENT(OUT) dummy argument of a pure subprogram shall not have
       an impure final subroutine or have a potential subobject
       component that has an impure final subroutine."
