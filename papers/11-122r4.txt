DISCUSSION

The Fortran programmer might pass an array with one attribute, say
allocatable, to an array with another, say assumed-shape. The Fortran
system takes care of this. From C, the C programmer needs to do a bit
of work.

Edits are provided to show an example.

A.2.2 Changing the attributes of an array

A C programmer might want to call more than one Fortran procedure and
the attributes of an array involved might differ between the procedures.
In this case, it is desirable to set up more than one C descriptor for
the array.  For example, this code fragment initializes two C
descriptors of rank 2, calls a procedure that allocates the array
described by the first descriptor, copies the base_addr pointer and dim
array to the second descriptor, then calls a procedure that expects an
assumed-shape array.

  CFI_DESC_T(2) loc_alloc, loc_assum;
  CFI_cdest_t * desc_alloc = (CFI_cdest_t *)&loc_alloc,
              * desc_assum = (CFI_cdest_t *)&loc_assum;
  CFI_dim_t dims[2];
  int rank = 2, flag;

  flag = CFI_establish_cdesc(desc_alloc,
                             NULL,
                             CFI_attribute_allocatable,
                             CFI_type_double,
                             sizeof(double),
                             rank,
                             dims[]);

  Fortran_factor (desc_alloc, ...); /* Allocates array described by desc_alloc */

  /* Use dim information from the allocated array in the assumed shape one */
  flag = CFI_establish_cdesc(desc_assum,
                             desc_alloc->base_addr,
                             CFI_attribute_assumed,
                             CFI_type_double,
                             sizeof(double),
                             rank,
                             dims[]);

  Fortran_solve (desc_assum, ...); /* Uses array allocated in Fortran_factor */
