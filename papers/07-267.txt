NUMBER: F03/0097
TITLE: Blanks as separators in NAMELIST input
KEYWORDS: Namelist input, blanks, separators
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:
1)  Was in intended that blanks be allowed as separators in Namelist
Input?

Consider an input fragment:

              I = 3              J = 4

Page 243:5 says that namelist value separators are the same as list
directed value separators.  Page 239:7 says those value separators are
"...blanks between values" and then defines what the values are.  The
"J" above isn't a value, so the blanks aren't separators and the
fragment is illegal for namelist input

2)  Is there a similar problem with namelist comments as in this
fragment?
              I = 3           !  this is a namelist comment



ANSWER:

1)  Yes, it was intended to allow blanks as separators for namelist
input.  Edits are supplied to correct the wording in the standard

2)  The fragment is legal, there are no problems with blanks before
comments.
