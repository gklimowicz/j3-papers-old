Subject:   F2018 interp: In array element order execution should
           apply to IMPURE elemental function only
Date: 2019-February-11

1. Introduction

In F2003, the standard says (12.7.2),
"In the array case, the values of the
elements, if any, of the result are the same as would have been
obtained if the scalar function had been applied separately,
in any order, to corresponding elements of each array actual
argument."

In F2008, we added the following in the Introduction section[xvi]
"An impure elemental procedure processes array arguments in array
element order."

However, we changed
p1 of 12.8.2 Elemental function actual arguments and results
from "in any order" to "in array element order" without saying this
should apply to IMPURE elemental function only.

In F2018, we kept the same wording as F2008 (15.8.2)


2. Interpretation Request

NUMBER: F18/xxxx
TITLE:  PURE Elemental function should be executed in any order.
KEYWORDS: ELEMENTAL, PURE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

If the argument of an pure elemental function is an array, should
the result be the same as it would have been obtained if the scalar
function had been applied, in any order, to corresponding elements of
each array actual argument.

ANSWER:

Yes. This is an oversight.

EDITS to 18-007r1:

[326: 22] In 15.8.2 Elemental function actual arguments and results
Change "in array element order" to "in array element order if it has
the PURE prefix or in any order otherwise"

It makes the whole sentence read,

"In the array case, the values of the elements, if any, of the result
are the same as would have been obtained if the scalar function had
been applied separately, in array element order if it has the PURE
prefix or in any order otherwise, to corresponding elements of each
array actual argument."
