Date:  21-Jul-2002
To:    WG5 and J3
From:  Stan Whitlock for J3/interp
Subj:  Current status of F95 interpretation processing

I have submitted the following papers for J3 meeting #162:

    02-006A.txt     currently open F95 interpretations to be processed
    02-006C1.txt    F95 interpretations in Corrigendum #1
    02-006C2.txt    F95 interpretations in Corrigendum #2

These will become the J3 standing documents 006A, 006C1, and 006C2:

    006C1 is equivalent to WG5/N1421.  See N1422 for the F95
          interpretations that make up Corrigendum #1.  006C1 will
          not be modified further.

    006C2 is the equivalent of WG5/N1472.  See N1473 for F95
          interpretations that make up Corrigendum #2.  006C2 will
          not be modified further.

    006A  is based on WG5/N1474, the F95 interpretations as of
          27-Nov-2001 that still needed processing aftedr Corrigendum
          #2 was completed.  006A will evolve into 006Ar1, etc, as
          more F95 interpretations are processed.

Here is the table of contents for 02-006A.txt with the interpretations contained in Corrigenda #1 and #2 removed so we can see what is left to be processed:

Please note that a new category as been added:

       interpretations that will not be considered for further
       processing:

There are several interpretations whose status is incorrect in 02-006A for meetint #162.  The following were marked as "Passed J3 meeting" but later failed a J3 letter ballot.  They should be marked in 02-006A as "J3 consideration in progress.  That corrected status is reflected in this paper.

   P I 000006     Character length specification of a function result
                    {01-380 m159 failed J3 LB}
   P E 000031     Association of pointer function result with
                    INTENT(OUT) dummy argument
                    {01-275 m158 failed J3 LB}
   P E 000068     Asterisks as I/O unit
                    {01-380 m159 failed J3 LB}
   P E F90/000207 Integer bit-model inconsistency
                    {01-380 m159 failed J3 LB}

There are several interpretations that have been passed by a J3 meeting and are eligible for a J3 letter ballot.  There will be such a letter ballot after meeting #162.


   M E JP-17      Multiple occurrence of namelist group object in
                    namelist group {02-130 at m160}
   M E JP-24      The bnf term shared-term-do-construct
                    {02-131r1 at m160}

There are 3 new F95 interpretations since N1474:

   P   000098     Are dummy functions returning assumed-length
                    character legal? {m160}
   P   000099     STAT= variable requirements in ALLOCATE {m162}
   P   000100     TARGET attribute and structure components {m162}

So if you do the math, there are

   24 P to be processed
    2 M to be J3 letter ballotted
    3 X excluded from futher processing
    1 P 000000e
   --
   30 in the list
