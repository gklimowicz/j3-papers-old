[40:1+] Add
	or <access-spec>

[40:43+] Add
	or <access-spec>
 Constraint: An <access-spec> (5.1.2.2) within a <component-def-stmt> is permitted only if the type 
             definition is within the specification part of a module.

[48:1-5]  Change to
If a type definition contains a PRIVATE statement that is a <private-sequence-stmt>, the default 
accessibility of its components is PRIVATE; otherwise the default accessibility of its components is 
PUBLIC.  If a component name is private, the internal structure of the type is inaccessible in any scoping
unit accessing the module via a USE statement.  Similarly, if any component name is private, the structure 
constructor for such a type shall be employed only within the defining module.

[48:28-32] Replace with
NOTE 4.32
The accessibility of a type name is independent of the accessibility of the components of the type.  It is 
possible to have all four combinations: a public name with a public component, a private name with a 
private component, a public name with a private component, and a private name with a public component.
The accessibility of a component of a structure is independent of the accessibility of any other component of 
the structure.

[49:7+] Add
NOTE 4.34a
If a type definition contains a PRIVATE statement (that is a <private-sequence-stmt>), the accessibility of a 
component may be overridden by an individual PUBLIC specification:

	TYPE MIXED
	   PRIVATE
	   INTEGER :: I
	   INTEGER, PUBLIC :: J 
	END TYPE MIXED

	TYPE (MIXED) M

M%J is accessible in any scoping unit accessing the module in which MIXED is defined; M%I is not.

[54:26+] Add
Constraint:  All components shall be accessible in the scoping unit containing the <structure-
                   constructor>.

[55:9] Change comment to "Nested form, all components of"

[55:11] Change comment to "Flattened form, all components of"

[65:26-27] Change "Entities without ..." to "Entities without an explicitly specified <access-spec> have 
default accessibility.  Default accessibility for a module is PUBLIC unless it has been changed by a 
PRIVATE statement (5.3.3)."

[377:7+] Add
C.1.? Extensible Types

The default accessibility of an extended type may be specified in the type definition.  The accessibility of its 
components may be specified individually.  [Insert the example on the second page of 98-198, changing the 
7th line from "end type my_type" to "end type base_type", changing "public :: base_type" to "base_type" and 
changing "private :: my_type" to "my_type".
