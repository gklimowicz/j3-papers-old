Discussion

We need to alter the wording of the final paragraph of 8.1.6
[183:14-18].  The statements executed during the execution of a
critical construct form a segment. We need to say that if image T is
the next to execute the construct after image M, the segment on image
M precedes the segment on image T. The present wording leaves each
such segment unordered with respect to any segment on another image.

The first sentence of the paragraph does not need rewording, but is
included in the edit to make it easy to understand the new wording of
the rest.



Edit to J3/07-007

[183:14-18] In 8.1.6 CRITICAL construct, replace the final paragraph by

The processor shall ensure that once an image has commenced executing
<block>, no other image shall commence executing <block> until this
image has completed executing <block>.  The image shall not execute an
image control statement during the execution of <block>. The sequence
of executed statements is therefore a segment (8.5.1). If image T is
the next to execute the construct after image M, the segment on image
M precedes the segment on image T.
