NUMBER: F95/0098
TITLE: Are dummy functions returning assumed-length character legal?
KEYWORDS: DUMMY FUNCTION, ASSUMED-LENGTH CHARACTER
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Are dummy functions returning assumed-length character legal?

Consider the following program:

        character*5 f
        external f
          call ss3(f)
        end
        subroutine ss3(ff)
        character*(*) ff, a*10
        external ff
          a = ff()//'99999999'
          print *, '<', a, '>'
        end
        function f()
        character*(*) f
          f = '123'
        end

The issue is the call to the dummy function 'ff' in subroutine 'ss3'.
Some compilers issue an error message. Others print the result:

 <123  99999>

There appear to be two relevant, contradictory passages in the F2003
standard. Refer to section 4.4.4.1. <> means italics, [] means
obsolescent font.

C417 says "A function name shall not be declared with an asterisk
<type-param-value> unless it is of type CHARACTER and is the name of
the result of an external function or the name of a dummy function.

At the end of the section, there is the text

"A char-length type parameter value of * has the following meaning:
(1)    ...
(2)    ...
(3)    ...
(4) [If used to specify the character length parameter of a function
result, any scoping unit invoking the function shall declare the
function name with a character length parameter value other than *
or access such a definition by host or use association. When the
function is invoked, the length of the result variable in the function
is assumed from the value of this type parameter.]"

According to the standard, the use in the example program is legal,
because 'ff' is the name of a dummy function. But it seems clear that
the standard intended that the length of the variable returned by
a character function be known at compile time; it is not known in the
case where the function is a dummy function.

ANSWER:

The program does not conform with the standard because of the rule
in item (4) in the final paragraph of 4.4.4.1, which is quoted above.
The function f is invoked from the scoping unit of ss3 within which
the function is declared with a character length parameter value of *.

This is different from interpretation 6 since the function has
assumed character length, which means that item (3) of page 51
applies.

Hence, I think the ANSWER should be
    The program does not conform with the standard because of the
    rule in item (3) of the list in 5.1.1.5. The function f is
    invoked from the scoping unit of ss3 within which the function
    name does not satisfy any of the required conditions.

   I agree with John that there is an issue here which is not
   adequately covered by Interp F95/000006.

   However, I think that the suggestion that item (3) of 5.1.1.5 means
   that the program is invalid is without merit.  A literal
   interpretation of item (3) means that even if subroutine SS3
   declared dummy FF as being CHARACTER*5, the program would still
   be invalid since the name of the function is F, not FF.  This
   would be a completely ridiculous result.  Thus item (3) of
   5.1.1.5 is faulty and an edit is required for it to handle
   (assumed-length) dummy functions at all.
