Subject: Comment GB-4 Rename the ALL STOP statement

References: WG5/N1802, WG5/N1803, J3/09-007r3


DISCUSSION

It is confusing that STOP initiates normal termination but the quite
similar ALL STOP initiates error termination. We suggest replacing
ALL STOP by a different, stronger, term namely ERROR STOP. The term
ALL STOP occurs in 12 places in the document in total.
