Reference: 16-007r1

In 13.9.59 DATE_AND_TIME, the TIME= has a faux pas.

Two consecutive sentences:

1. It is assigned a value of the form /hhmmss.sss/, where . . .

2. The characters of this value shall all be decimal digits.

Assuming we are not attempting to reclassify . as a decimal digit,
I suggest the repair below.

Note that in the ZONE= description, the language is careful to say
that following the sign character they shall be decimal digits.

{against 16-007r1 - I want to record this while I can remember it}

Edits in 13.9.59 DATE_AND_TIME, the TIME= description

[368:18] Change
The characters of this value shall all be decimal digits.
to
Except for the decimal point, the characters of this value
shall all be decimal digits.

{repair silly contradiction}
