--------------------------

At J3/PL22.3 meeting 187 (February, 2009, Las Vegas), we discussed
alternative meeting schedules in future years, and planned to continue
the discussion at meeting 188.  The current schedule (meetings in
February, May, August, November) was seen as having some recurring
faults. While no conclusion was reached, the option of having three
meetings each year, starting in 2010, in February, June, and October,
seemed to generate some interest.  The aim of this paper is to record
some of the advantages and disadvantages of such a change, as a
starting point for discussion.

Proposal:
---------

Starting is 2010, hold J3/PL22.3 meetings (sometimes joint with WG5)
three times each year, during the second full week of February, June,
and October.

Advantages:
----------

1) Fewer meetings reduces cost to members, reducing the probability of
members dropping off the committee.

2) The new schedule avoids several problems of the current schedule:

   - It avoids the hot August month in Las Vegas
   - It avoids higher airfares sometimes hitting the August meeting
   - It avoids vacation conflicts with August
   - It avoids the end of the academic year in May
   - It avoids the US election dates in November
   - It avoids the frequent conflict with the Supercomputing conference


3) At least one meeting is outside the academic year, making
attendance easier for members with academic duties.


Disadvantages:
--------------

1) Three meetings each year may not provide enough time to get the
required work done. Especially if there are many new features in the
next revision, or if there are may interp requests resulting from
F2008.

2) Some people might have made long term plans around the current
schedule.

3) With fewer meetings, we might not be able to negotiate hotel rates
as favorable as at present.
