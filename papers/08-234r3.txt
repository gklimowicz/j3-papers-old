Subject: "constraint C538"

Constraint C538 in Section 5.3.9 introduces an
incompatibility with Fortran 2003 that is not
described in Section 1.5 of the Fortran 2008
draft.

The Fortran 90 standard required the name of an
external procedure used as an actual argument
to be declared in an EXTERNAL statement or in
an interface block.  Because the name of an
external procedure could not appear in an
interface block in the subprogram in which it
is defined, that effectively required the name
to appear in an EXTERNAL statement if it was
passed as an argument.  What once was required
now is prohibited.

I suggest adding a mention of constraint C538 to
the list of incompatibilities in Section 1.5.2.

J3 response:

C538 repeats a requirement from 04-007 (Fortran 2003) subclause
12.3.2.2.  It was made a constraint in 06-007r1.

There is no incompatibility with Fortran 2003.

This requirement did not appear in subclause 12.3.2.2 in Fortran 95.

Instead, subclause 12.3.2.2 of Fortran 95 required that a procedure
that is used as an actual argument shall either have explicit
interface or be explicitly declared to have the EXTERNAL attribute. 
In Fortran 95, an external procedure has explicit interface within its
own body if it is recursive.  Therefore, it was not required to
specify a procedure to have the EXTERNAL attribute, within its own
body, if it is used as an actual argument.  If it is not recursive, it
did not have explicit interface, but there was no point in passing it
as an actual argument, since it could not be executed, and until
Fortran 2003 it could not be a pointer target, so there was no need to
specify explicitly that it had the EXTERNAL attribute.

In Fortran 2008, all procedures have explicit interface within the
subprograms that define them (12.4.2.1p1).

It was not clear in Fortran 95 whether a recursive procedure name could
be explicitly given the EXTERNAL attribute within its own body.

If there was an incompatibility between Fortran 95 and Fortran 2003,
the correct mechanism to correct it or announce it is a corrigendum.
