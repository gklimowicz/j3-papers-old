TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS

We will recommend that these errors be fixed in f2k.
(All except the last are also in 02-309).

WORDING PROBLEMS

We have considered the following issues and decided to take
no action on them for the reasons specified.

  W1.  The two contexts are sufficiently different to minimize
    confusion.  Also, there are existing implementations.

  W2.  This wording was used in f95.

  W4.  This wording was used in f95 and is not sufficiently
     confusing to merit the work to change it.

  W10. The duplication is helpful here.

  W16. No better words have been suggested.

  W24. This problem from a previous draft and was fixed in the CD.

We will recommend that the following issues be fixed,
with edits to be determined.

  W8, W9

We will recommend the following edits to fix the indicated comments.

  W3. [33:12] "Variables may be objects or subobjects." ->
        "A variable is a data object."

      [114:25] Delete "or subobject".

  W5. [126:Note 7.9] "activation record" ->
      "instance of a procedure".

  W6. [102:15] "first" -> "value of the first"
      [105:15] "second" -> "value of the second"
      [105:17] "values of the starting and ending point expressions"
             -> "starting and ending points"

  W7. [398:36-38] and [399:3-4] Move "as an argument keyword" to the
      beginning of its sentence, add a comma after it, and adjust
      capitalization.  "As an argument keyword, it" -> "It".  (twice)

  W11. [16:32-33] Delete sentence "In contexts...of the structure."

  W12. [19:5] and [418:26] Change "and" to "or" (twice).

  W13. [19:23,24] change "may be" to "is" (twice).

  W14. Unbold "components" on [41:7].  Move the bold on [59:19]
       to the second instance of "finalized".

  W15. [114:9,10] "an allocated" -> "any allocated" (twice).

  W17. [398:Note 16.6]  "may be found" -> "is".

  W18. [211:30-31] Delete sentence "The value...specified unit."

  W19. [287:10] "unallocated" -> "unallocated allocatables".

  W20. [194:25] "ID= specifier" -> "identifier (9.5.1.8)".

  W21. [230:26] "rounded" -> "rounding mode"

  W22. [231:1] Move ", w-n shall be positive" to after the following
       table, changing the comma to "The value of" and appending
       a period.

  W23. [237:2] After ";" insert "in this case".

  W25. [443:12] "can be used only" -> "may only be used".

  W26. [43:Note 4.18] "a bound for an <explicit-shape-spec> or a
       <type-param-value>" -> "a <type-param-value> or a bound in
       an <explicit-shape-spec>".

  W27. [249:1] Delete "explicitly".

  Another edit.  On the last 2 lines of [xiii], delete
     ", and access ... conditions)".

TECHNICAL ISSUES

The replies to T1 and T2 are in 02-310R1.

We have considered the following issues and decided to take
no action on them for the reasons specified.

  T3, T4.  These were mentioned in F90 and F95.  It would
    be confusing to remove them now.

  T7. This usage is consistent with that of some existing
    implementations.

  T17. Other papers propose to delete these constants
    instead.

  T19. The role of ABSTRACT here is similar to that of
    prefixes in function and subroutine statements.

  T23. The final procedures necessary to support INTENT(OUT)
    might not be available for the DTIO case.

We will recommend that the following issues be fixed,
with edits to be determined.

  T5, T6, T8 (see 02-313r2)

We will recommend the following edits to address the
specified issues.

  T9. [78:35] Insert "abstract" before "interface"

  T10. [252:13-14] Delete the last sentence.

  T11. [269:1] Replace "subobject selector" with
       "component selector, array section selector,
        array element selector, or substring selector".

  T12. [20:15] "In an actual argument list"
       -> "as an actual argument".

  T13. Same issue as answered in 02-278r2.

  T14. [55:5] "specific" -> "nongeneric"

  T15. [260:5] Delete ", an abstract interface".

  T16. [45:27] Append sentence "If the kind selector is omitted,
       the kind type parameter is default integer."

  T18. [255:32] "without a generic specification" ->
       "with neither ABSTRACT nor a generic specification".

  T20. [131:9] "required to evaluate only" ->
       "only required to evaluate".

  T21. [272:22,32] "specific only" -> "only specific" (twice)

  T22. [274:6] Insert "only" before "specific".

  T24. [397:15] Delete "or type-bound".

  T25. [401:28] "contains" -> "is the host of".
