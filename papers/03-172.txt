Subject: Edits for UK Comment MCT14 Interop I/O Issues

Reference: This paper is a partial revision of the "Comment MTC14 of
the UK" part of J3/03-128.  Paper 03-170r1 addresses the remaining
issues in MTC14.

Edits refer to 02-007R3.
------------------------

Comment MTC14 raised 6 issues regarding C interoperability.

Issues (1), (2), (5), and (6) are addressed in 03-170r1.

Issues (3) and (4) are addressed below.


The standard has no normative text to suggest what might happen if a
user performs I/O operations on a file that is connected to both a
Fortran unit and a C stream. This is discussed in non-normative text
[470:28-29]. Edits are provided to state that this is processor
dependent, but it is possible to avoid problems if restrictions are
observed.


[180:3] After "dependent." add "If the processor allows a unit to be
connected to a file which is also connected to a C stream, the results
of performing I/O operations on such a file are processor dependent.

[180:5] Add "I/O to and from external files can be performed without
interference, as long as procedures defined by different means do not
do I/O to/from the same external file."

[392:26+] If a procedure defined by means of Fortran and a procedure
defined by means other than Fortran perform I/O operations on the same
external file, the results are processor dependent. (9.4.3).
