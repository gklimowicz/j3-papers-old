Subject: Intrinsic and Non-intrinsic Modules??

One item in n1510 asks whether an Intrinsic module
and a non-intrinsic module can have the same name
in the same program.

Aside from a desire to punish anyone who attempts this
sort of foolishness, I think we can answer "NO".

No edits are necessary, since 395:19-20 seems pretty clear.

EDITS:

None needed.
