1. Introduction

Various proposed features for "conditional and" functionality and similar
were proposed for Fortran 2008, but failed due to lack of consensus as to
whether these should be functions or operators.

This paper suggests reconsideration; for syntax we should avoid either
function or operator syntax in favour of keywords, since these are not
really functions.


2. Motivation

People have wanted to write things like
  IF (I<N .AND. A(I)==0) ...
for decades.  So far, we have fobbed them off and they have to write
  IF (I<N) THEN
    IF (A(I)) ...
  END IF
which is not just verbose but less convenient when wishing to test a series
of conditions.

Similarly, writing
  IF (PRESENT(D)) THEN
    CALL SUB(A,B,C,D)
  ELSE IF (X<1) THEN
    CALL SUB(A,B,C,EPSILON(X))
  ELSE
    CALL SUB(A,B,C,SPACING(X))
  END IF
is verbose but usable when only one argument is conditional, but rapidly
degenerates when there are several arguments requiring similar handling.


3. Requirements

(1) Conditional expressions: based on one or more conditions, a
    sub-expression is selected for evaluation and the other sub-expressions
    are not evaluated.  This encompasses the functionality of "conditional
    and" and "conditional not" operations.

(2) Conditional arguments: using similar syntax, selecting an actual
    argument from two or more data objects.  This should allow for an
    object not to be selected in the case of passing to an optional
    dummy argument.

The expression form should be nestable.


4. Not requirements

The actual argument form could be nestable, but doing that would take some
complicated wording, and is likely to read to unleadable user code, so this
is not a requirement.

Procedure pointers are adequate for conditionally passing procedures (or
not), and alternate returns are obsolescent, therefore the conditional
argument form need only handle data objects.  Similar considerations imply
that the conditional expression form also need only handle data objects.


5. Syntax

<conditional-expr> ::= IF ( <logical-expr>  ) THEN ( <expr> )
                       [ ELSE IF ( <logical-expr> ) THEN ( <expr> ) ]...
                       ELSE ( <expr> ) END IF

A <conditional-expr> is a primary.  The syntax can be disambiguated from
that of a function reference as soon as the "THEN" keyword has been seen.

Constraint: Each <expr> in a <conditional-expr> shall have the same
            declared type, kind type parameters, and rank.

<conditional-arg> ::=
      IF ( <logical-expr> ) THEN ( <consequent-arg> )
      [ ELSE IF ( <logical-expr> ) THEN ( <consequent-arg> ) ]...
      [ ELSE ( <consequent-arg> ) ]
      END IF
<consequent-arg> ::= <expr> | <variable>

A <conditional-arg> is an actual argument (<actual-arg>).

Constraint: In a <conditional-arg>, each <expr> or <variable> that is a
            <consequent-arg> shall have the same declared type, kind type
            parameters, and rank.

Constraint: If the corresponding dummy argument is not optional, the
            ELSE clause shall appear in the <conditional-arg>.

Constraint: In a <conditional-arg>, if any <consequent-arg> is a
            <variable>, all other <consequent-arg>s in that
            <conditional-arg> shall be a <variable>.

This is to make it easier for humans as well as computers to understand
what is being done.  No reasonable functionality is lost as passing the
value of a variable is available by using parentheses (having the actual
argument being a variable depending on the logical expressions is not
reasonable).

Constraint: If the corresponding dummy argument is allocatable, a pointer,
            or a coarray, the attributes of each <consequent-arg> shall
            satisfy the requirements of that dummy argument.

This is to eliminate the possibility of an argument mismatch error at
runtime depending on the results of the <logical-expr>s.  The wording
permits a consequent argument to be a pointer, allocatable, or have corank
indepently of the other consequent arguments but not independently of the
dummy argument.

Constraint: In a reference to a generic procedure, each <consequent-arg> in
            a <conditional-arg> shall have the same corank, and if any
            <expr> in a <conditional-arg> has the allocatable or pointer
            attribute, each <expr> shall have that attribute.

This retains generic resolution at compile time.


6. Alternative syntax discussion

Firstly, some design principles:

(a) it should be visibly different from function syntax,
    because it is not a function;
(b) it should be visibly different from operator syntax,
    because it is not an operation;
(c) the difference should be "near the front" of the conditional
    expression so as to simplify parsing by computers as
    well as humans;
(d) it should nest unambigously, and any parentheses needed
    should be part of the syntax (otherwise the "variable" case
    cannot be nested);
(e) it should be readable & Fortran-like and not like line noise,
    -- readability is self-evidently desirable.

Both (a) and (b) are desirable because
(i) this does not follow the usual "evaluate the arguments/operands and
    call the function/do the operation",
(ii) we do not want to affect operator priorities, and
(iii) we do not want to invade the user namespace unnecessarily.

Some possible (and some have actually been proposed) examples:

(1) <logical-expr> ? <expr> : <expr>
   satisfies (a)-(c), but not (d) or (e);

(2) (? <logical-expr> : <expr> : <expr> ?)
    satisfies (a)-(d), but not (e);

(3) ( <logical-expr> | <expr> : <expr> )
    satisfies (a)-(d), but is even worse on (e);

(4) <logical-expr> .ANDTHEN. <logical-expr>
    <logical-expr> .ORELSE. <logical-expr>
    satisfies (a),(c),(e) but not (b) or (d),
    and only provides short-cut logical conditions, not general selection;

(5) .IF. <logical-expr> .THEN. <expr> .ELSE. <expr> .ENDIF.
    satisfies (a), (b), (d), but not (c) and is weak on (e).

The ordinary keyword form suggested in section 5, while more verbose than
some of the above, best satisfies the design principles.


7. Semantics

Evaluating a <conditional-expr> or <conditional-arg> selects an <expr> or
<variable> by evaluating each <logical-expr> in turn until one of them is
true, or the ELSE or ENDIF clause is reached; the corresponding <expr> or
<variable>, if any, is the one selected.

The declared type, type parameters, and rank of a <conditional-arg> or
<conditional-expr> is that of the <expr>s or <actual-arg>s that it
contains.

The value of a <conditional-expr> is the value of the selected <expr>.

If evaluating a <conditional-arg> selects no <expr> or <variable>, there is
no effective argument associated with the dummy argument.  Otherwise, the
selected <expr> or <variable> is the effective argument.

All static requirements from a dummy argument on effective arguments apply
to any <consequent-arg>, for example if coindexed objects are prohibited as
an actual argument they are also prohibited as a consequent argument.  This
will need additional wording in the standard.


8. Estimated impact

The impact on the standard is relatively minor, but more than a simple
intrinsic function.

The impact on implementations is probably minor, but certainly not trivial.

This is a completely new feature.  It does not satisfy the Markham
resolution; however it might still be worthy of consideration.
