1. Introduction

This paper discusses the standing documents and other procedures for the
next revision.  It might seem a bit early for the next revision but we are
accumulating editorial changes and technical fixes quite quickly.

Since I am looking at the standing documents, the web site's links are
also discussed.


2. Corrigenda edit question

Should the edits from the corrigenda be included in the 008?
(Even though they are not editorial.)

Or should both the corrigenda edits and the 008 edits be collected
in another document, e.g. 014 or 019?


3. Editor's standing documents

In the list below, the title listed is the one shown on the web site.

008 Editorial Enhancements for Future Draft Revisions
  Internal title: Editorial enhancements for future revisions
  Current version: 12-008.
ACTION: Web link title change requested.

011 Edit Issues
  Internal title: Editor's list of unresolved technical issues
  Current version (as of 2012/01/29): 09-011r2.
  Web site linked version (as of 2012/01/29): 09-011.
  Both of these are out of date and uninteresting except possibly
  historically; a new "empty" version has been submitted.
ACTION: Web link title change requested.

014 Cumulative edits for F2008 development
  Current version (as of 2012/01/29): 06-014.
  This document is now historical.
QUESTION: Should it not be re-purposed for the next revision?
  (If so, perhaps we should change its title and replace it with an empty
   version until we start F201x development.)
  (If not, it will be mothballed forever...)
  A subsidiary question is that if/when we start using it, should the edits
  from 008 be included in it?

018 Interpretation update pages
  A new version of this is underway (12-018) for 10-007r1.
  It will contain only the edits from corrigendum 1.
QUESTION: Do we want this now, or wait until after publication?

019 Cumulative Edits for Corrections
  Internal title: Cumulative edits for corrections to the current 007.
  This is for J3-approved edits during the integration phase, not the
    development phase.
  Current version: 09-019 (empty thus correct as is).
ACTION: Web link title change requested.

020 Cumulative Edits for Feature Changes
  Internal title: Cumulative edits for feature changes to the current 007.
  This is for J3-approved edits during the integration phase, not the
    development phase.
  Current version: 09-020 (empty thus correct as is).
ACTION: Web link title change requested.


4. Other standing document links on the web site

000 Register of Documents
  The web link is to 07-000 i.e. 2007 not current.
  We seem to have stopped producing these, though per-meeting excerpts
  appear in the minutes of each meeting; e.g. no 10-000 or 11-000.
ACTION: (a) Produce 10-000, 11-000 and replace the SD web link with
            the latter.
        (b) At the end of 2012 produce 12-000.

001 Membership List
  The web link is to 09-001r3 i.e. 2009 not current.
ACTION: Update web link.

002 LaTeX Document Class for J3
  The web link is to 08-002; I think that is the current version.
  This is missing many macros added by the editor during F2008.
ACTION: Editor to produce revised 002.

003 J3 Member References
  The web link is 404.
  I do not have a copy of this myself; I have no idea what it is.
ACTION: ?

004 Journal of Requirements
  The web link is to 95-004r1.
  This is incredibly ancient.
  It is unclear to me how this document should differ from 009.
  We should either reinvigorate it or mothball it, perhaps by
    changing its title to "Journal of Requirements for Fortran 2000".
ACTION: ?

005 J3 Resolutions and Responses to WG5 Resolutions
  The web link is 404.
ACTION: ?

006 Defect Report
  The web link is to 09-006Ar1 i.e. 2009 not current.
  (As of 2012/01/29, the current version appears to be 11-006A).
  Internal title: Outstanding Fortran Interpretations
ACTION: (a) Web link title change requested.
        (b) Update requested.

009 Technical Proposals for Future Revisions
  The web link is 404.
  It is unclear to me how 009 is intended to differ from 004.
ACTION: (decide in conjunction with 004).

010 J3 Work Plan
  The web link is 404.
ACTION: ?

012 Friends of J3
  The web link is to 06-012r1 i.e. 2006 not current.
  (Maybe the latest one is 08-012).
ACTION: Update web link.

013 Guidelines for Submitting J3 Papers
  The web link is to 08-013; I think that is the current one.

015 Completed Fortran 95 Interpretations
  The web link is to 05-015, which seems to be the last 015 but
  unfortunately it is out of date (there were more F95 interps
  completed in 09-008AT4).
  This should be cancelled or updated or something.
ACTION: ?

016 Fortran 2003 Interpretations for Corrigendum 1
  Internal title: Completed Fortran 2003 Interpretations for Corrigendum 1
  The web link is to 05-016, and is presumably current since
  it is an historical document.
ACTION: Web link title change requested.

017 Fortran 2003 Interpretations for Corrigendum 2
  Internal title: Completed Fortran 2003 Interpretations for Corrigendum 2
  The web link is to 06-006T2r1, and is presumably current since
  it is an historical document.
ACTION: Web link title change requested.

021 Fortran 2003 Interpretations for Corrigendum 3
  The web link is 404.
  Is there a document for this?
ACTION ?

022 Fortran 2003 Interpretations for Corrigendum 4
  The web link is 404.
  Is there a document for this?
ACTION ?
