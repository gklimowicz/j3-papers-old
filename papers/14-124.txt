Subject: INQUIRE statement and interdependence of specifier values
Date: 2014 February 12

1. UTI
======

14-106 observed a problem with the INQUIRE statement.

[14-007:245:11+] Insert a UTI:

  The INQUIRE statement

    INQUIRE(FILE='fred',EXIST=exist)

  is not allowed because the value of EXIST= depends on the value of
  FILE=."

This is a problem because 9.12p5 says

  "The value of a specifier in an input/output statement shall not
  depend on the definition or evaluation of any other specifier in the
  <io-control-spec-list> or <inquire-spec-list> in that statement."
