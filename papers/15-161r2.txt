Subject:   Interp: assign to deferred-length coindexed character

NUMBER: F08/0140
TITLE: Assign to deferred-length coindexed character variable
KEYWORDS: Cobounds, type declaration
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Q1. Consider the program:

  Program p1
    Type t
      Character(:), Allocatable :: C
    End Type
    Type(t) x[*]
    Allocate ( Character(42) :: x%c )
    Sync All
    If (This_Image()==1) x[2]%c = 'stuff'
  End Program

Is the assignment permitted?

Q2. Consider

  Program p2
    Type t
      Character(:), Pointer :: C
    End Type
    Type(t) x[*]
    Allocate ( Character(42) :: x%c )
    Sync All
    If (This_Image()==1) x[2]%c = 'stuff'
  End Program

ANSWER:

A1. This is not permitted, as it violates the requirement in 7.2.1.2
    Intrinsic assignment statement, paragraph 2, which states that if
    the variable (in an intrinsic assignment statement) is coindexed,
    its deferred length type parameters shall be the same as the
    corresponding type parameters of the expression.

    There is a grammatical error in this requirement; an edit is
    supplied to correct the grammatical error.

A2. This was intended to be permitted, but was inadvertently caught in
    the prohibition that was intended to apply only to allocatable
    variables.  An edit is supplied to correct this error.

EDITS:

[153:25] 7.2.1.2p2, after "coindexed object,", delete "the variable",
[153:26] before "shall not be" insert "the variable",
[153:27] before "shall not have" insert "the variable",
[153:28] change "each"
         to "if the variable is allocatable, each".
making the whole paragraph read

  "If <variable> is a coindexed object,
     - the variable shall not be polymorphic,
     - the variable shall not have an allocatable ultimate component,
       and
     - if the variable is allocatable, each deferred length type
       parameter shall have the same value as the corresponding
       type parameter of <expr>.".
