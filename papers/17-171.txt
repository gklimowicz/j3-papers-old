1. Introduction

This paper contains the responses to the following CD ballot comments:
    JP-001, US-002, JP-003, JP-005, JP-006, GB-033, GB-038, US-045


2. Responses to comments

JP-001 (3.141, 21:38) comment:
    The phrase "and if it is a variable defined" is unclear.
    Change it to "and defined if it is a variable".
Response:
    Declined.  This text is unchanged from Fortran 2008.
    Its grammar is correct, and it has good style.

US-002 (4.4.2, 33:9-10) comment:
    Fortran 2008 is missing from the list of standards that did not
    include the current deleted features.
    Add "Fortran 2008" to the list.
Response:
    Accepted, however the rest of the sentence in question is also
    incorrect.  Edits are included to address this problem and the
    additional problems found.

JP-003 (5.3.6, p41) comment:
    Although the terms "stopped image" and "failed image" appear in the
    clause 5.3.6 and their references exist in Index, "active image" does
    not appear in the clause then its reference does not exist in Index.
    It would be more convenient to use the term "active image" (not
    "active" solely) in the clause 5.3.6.
    Change "All other images are active" to, for example, "An image that
    is neither a stopped image nor a failed image is an active image".
Response:
    Agreed that "active image" should have been indexed for this page.
    Agreed that use of the complete term "active image" would be better
    style.
    An edit is included to change "are active" to "are active images",
    with appropriate indexing and hyperlinking.

JP-005 (7.4.3.1, 62:16) comment:
    The phrase "if it is does not appear" is incorrect.
    Delete "is" in the phrase.
Response:
    Agreed.  The suggested edit is included.

JP-006 (7.4.3.2, 62:23-24) comment:
    The order of intrinsic functions list does not correspond to their
    descriptions in the sentence.
    Change "RADIX (16.9.154) and RANGE (16.9.158)" to "RANGE (16.9.158)
    and RADIX (16.9.154)", or change the order of their descriptions list.
Response:
    Agreed.  An edit for the first suggestion is included.

GB-033 (16.9.78, 385:14) comment:
    There is a typographical error here.
    Change "6,]," to "6],".
Response:
    Agreed.  The suggested edit is included.

GB-038 (17.11.19, 463:9) comment:
    Inconsistent format.
    Remove new line after "Result Value.".
Response:
    Our formatting of intrinsic procedure and intrinsic module procedure
    descriptions suffers from several defects; in particular, some
    paragraphs begin with bold letters as a subheading, and others don't,
    and these are intended to be "below" the preceding subheading.  This
    is substantially less than ideal.  It would be a good idea to review
    our formatting of multiple linked paragraphs, and perhaps either
    (a) make only the subheading a numbered paragraph, so that its
        sub-paragraphs are unnumbered (as already occurs for the
        "Case (i)" form), or
    (b) make such a subheading into a separate unnumbered line, leaving
        its sub-paragraphs numbered.

    However, for now, the suggested edit is accepted, and an edit is
    included for this, along with fixes for other formatting problems
    found whilst investigating this one.

US-045 (Foreword, xvii) comment:
    Corrigendum 4 to Fortran 2008 is missing from the documents
    incorporated into the new standard.
    Add "ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010/Cor. 4:2016" to the list in the second
    sentence of para 6.
Response:
    Agreed.  The suggested edit is included.

          Replace entire paragraph of entire subclause with new text:
  "There are two groups of deleted features.  The first group contains
   features for which better methods existed in {\sc Fortran} 77; these
   features were not included in Fortran 95, Fortran 2003, or Fortran
   2008, and are not included in this document.  The second group contains
   features for which better methods existed in Fortran 90; these features
   were included in Fortran 2008, but are not included in this document."
{US-002.}

[41:26] 5.3.6 Image execution states, p1,
        Change "All other images are active."

        and index it.
