Subject: US 12, arrays of coarrays
Date: 2019-August-07

Discussion
----------

F202X feature US-12 proposes allowing an object of a derived type that
has an allocatable coarray component to be an array and to be
allocatable. See 18-280r1.  In the array case, there is a separate
coarray for each element of the parent array and coarrays in separate
elements are not required to have the same bounds and cobounds.

This paper proposes corresponding edits. It is likely that more edits
will be needed.

Edits to 18-007r1
-----------------

[95:26-27] In 8.5.6 CODIMENSION attribute, change C825 to
"C825 An entity whose type has a coarray ultimate component shall
not be a pointer, shall not be a coarray, and shall not be a function
result."

[96:12+] In 8.5.6.2 Allocatable coarray, add a new para 6:
"If an array is of a type with an allocatable coarray component, it
shall have the same lower bounds and the same upper bounds on all
images of the current team."

[133:19+] In 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement, after C948 add
C948a (R927) The source-expr of a SOURCE= specifier shall not have an
allocated coarray component.

[134:17+] In 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, at the end of
para 3, add
"If the coarray is a component of an array element, each of the
subscripts that selects the array element shall have the same value on
all active images of the current team."

[160:10] In 10.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, para 1, item(3),
change "not a coarray" to "not a coarray or an array with a coarray
component" so that the item becomes
"(3) the variable and expr shall be conformable unless the variable
is an allocatable array that has the same rank as expr and is not
a coarray or an array with a coarray component",

[198:14] In 11.6.1 Image control statements, para 2, replace
"ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE" bullet 5 by the two bullets
    o ALLOCATE statement that has a coarray allocation;
    o DEALLOCATE statement that has a coarray allocate-object or
      an allocate-object that has a coarray ultimate component;

[308:25-26] In 15.5.2.8 Coarray dummy variables, para 2, add
", is an array that has the CONTIGUOUS attribute and has
a coarray ultimate component," after "CONTIGUOUS attribute" to
make the para. become
"If the dummy argument is an array coarray that has the CONTIGUOUS
attribute, is an array that has the CONTIGUOUS attribute and has
a coarray ultimate component, or is not of assumed shape, the
corresponding actual argument shall be simply contiguous or an
element of a simply contiguous array."
