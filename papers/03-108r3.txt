Subject: Response to Comment

In response to a public comment on the CD,
(Public Comment #9 from A. Markus, point #2),
J3 agreed to recommend that constants be added
to the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
to specify the sizes of the numeric storage unit,
the character storage unit, and the file storage unit.
This paper proposes edits to do so.  Following a suggestion
from John Reid, cross references are also added.
Van suggested language more consistent with existing language.

EDITS:

177:16 Add the sentence: 'The size in bits of the file storage unit
is the value of the constant FILE_STORAGE_SIZE (13.8.3.3.3)
defined in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.'

354:9+ Add:
13.8.3.3 Size of Storage Units
The processor shall provide three constants giving
the processor-dependent sizes of the numeric storage unit,
the character storage unit, and the file storage unit,
expressed in bits.

13.8.3.3.1 NUMERIC_STORAGE_SIZE
The value of the default integer scalar constant NUMERIC_STORAGE_SIZE
is the size expressed in bits of the numeric storage unit
(16.4.3.1).

13.8.3.3.2 CHARACTER_STORAGE_SIZE
The value of the default integer scalar constant CHARACTER_STORAGE_SIZE
is the size expressed in bits of the character storage unit
(16.4.3.1).

13.8.3.3.3 FILE_STORAGE_SIZE
The value of the default integer scalar constant FILE_STORAGE_SIZE
is the size expressed in bits of the file storage unit
(9.2.4).

405:28 Add the sentence:
"The sizes of the numeric storage unit, the character
storage unit and the file storage unit are
the value of constants in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
intrinsic module (13.8.3.3)."
