[515:21 19.5.1.2p1 Argument association] Replace "dummy" with "actual",
and "an actual" with "a dummy", giving "... correspondence between each
actual argument and a dummy argument...." {Original text didn't work if
no actual argument textually appears.}

[515:22 19.5.1.2p1  Argument association] Insert "present" before "dummy
argument".

[521:7-12 19.5.2.5p1(9)(e)+ Events that cause the association status of
pointers to become undefined] So as not to contradict 19.5.2.5p1(6-7),
replace "unless" with "if" at [521:7], replace "has" with "does not
have" at [521:8], replace "is" with "is not" four times at [521:9-12],
replace "or" with "and" at [521:11], and replace "return value" with
"result" at [521:12].  The revised item is:

  (9) execution of an instance of a subprogram completes and the pointer
      is declared or accessed in the subprogram that defines the
      procedure if the pointer
      (a) does not have the SAVE attribute,
      (b) is not in blank common,
      (c) is not in a named common block that is declared in at least
          one other scoping unit that is in execution,
      (d) is not accessed by use or host association, and
      (e) is not the result of a function declared to have the POINTER
           attribute,

[525:1 19.5.5p5(3) Establising associations] after "(it is defined),"
insert "values of type parameters that are assumed,"

[525:4 19.5.5p5(3) Establising associations] Append a sentence:

"If the entities are arrays, the association is argument association,
and the shape of the associating entity is deferred, its shape becomes
the same as the shape of the corresponding effective argument."

[525:6 19.5.5p5(4) Establising associations] Before "and" insert "the
values of assumed type parameters if any become the same as the values
of corresponding type parameters of the pre-existing entity,"

[525:7+ 19.5.5p5(4) Establising associations] Insert a list item:

"  o  If an associating entity has an assumed type parameter, its value
      becomes the same as that of the corresponding type parameter of
      the pre-existing entity."

[530:33 19.6.7p1(12)] Replace "a" with "an".

------------------------

To the extent 19.5.2.3-6 and 19.5.5-6 are recapitulation of normative
text from elsewhere, it would be helpful to have cross references to the
normative text that supports the items.  This is a substantial project.
