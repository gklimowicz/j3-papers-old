Subject: F202Y Intrinsics for source file name and current line number
Date: 2023-June-14

Reference: 23-154

Users have requested a way to get the source name and source line
in their programs, perhaps as a debugging aid, perhaps for logging
purposes, etc.

This can be done with many preprocessors today; the gcc spellings
are __FILE__ and __LINE__ for example.  And this could also be part
of the Fortran preprocessor feature request as well, of course.

To avoid the requirement of a preprocessor, this proposal is to create
module intrinsics, similar to COMPILER_OPTIONS and COMPILER_VERSION, 
and nominally called SOURCE_FILE and SOURCE_LINE that can be called in
the user program to retrieve this information.   

These should be useable in constant expressions or specification
inquiries, again, similar to COMPILER_OPTIONS and COMPILER_VERSION.
