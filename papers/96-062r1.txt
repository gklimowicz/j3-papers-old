Subject: 	Proposal for remaining F90 defect items


Here are my suggestions for the remaining F90 defect items (96-006).

1) Rename standing document 006 to some new number, and archive it.

2) Copy over all the unresolved items in the old 006 into the "new"
   F95 version of 006, if they are also applicable to F95.
   Renumber the items, starting at one.  i.e. the new 006 will be the
   Fortran 95 006.

3) For any old 006 items which do not apply to F95, send a note to the
   original submitter, explaining that there will not be any more corrig-
   endas against F90, and that this question was not addressed in Fortran
   90, but has been resolved in F95.  Indicate how it was resolved.  If
   it was an item which did not really require any edits in Fortran 90,
   explain why not.

4) After the DIS is approved, we can start answering the old (and any new)
   questions, and include correct line # / page # information.
