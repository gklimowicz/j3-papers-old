1. Introduction
This paper replaces 19-181. 19-244.

2. Question
16.6 par. 7 contains this statement pertaining to the execution of a
collective subroutine:
"If the STAT argument is present and ... the current team contained
failed images, an error condition occurs and the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is
assigned to the STAT argument".
Given that an image might fail during the execution of the collective
subroutine, what exactly does this require of the implementation and
is it deliverable?

3. Response
This statement is stronger than was intended. A collective subroutine
is defined (3.143.2) as an "intrinsic subroutine that performs a
calculation on a team of images without requiring synchronization".
For performance reasons, it was intended that once an image has
completed its calculation it should be free to execute other statements
without waiting for the other images to do so. 16.7 para. 7 seems to
require that a synchronization of all images of the team should occur
before any are freed in order to ensure that none have failed. This
was not intended and an edit is provided to correct this. A similar
issue applies to stopped images.

4. Edits to 18-007r1
[331:32] In 16.6 Collective subroutines, para 7, sentence 1, change
        "current team contains stopped images"
    to
        "current team contains images known to have stopped".

    so that the sentence becomes
        "If the STAT argument is present and the current team contains
         images known to have stopped, an error condition occurs and
         the value STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module
         ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is assigned to the STAT argument."

[331:34] In 16.6 Collective subroutines, para 7, sentence 2, change
        "if the current team contained failed images"
    to
        "if the current team contains images known to have failed".

    so that the sentence becomes
        "Otherwise, if the current team contains images known to
         have failed, an error condition occurs and the value
         STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
         is assigned to the STAT argument."
