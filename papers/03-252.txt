1.1    Opening business                              D. Nagle

     The meeting was called to order at 8:00 AM, Monday, August

     Goal:  Do the final edits, following the lead of WG5.  Our only
            business is editorial unless we find a flat out blunder.
            Editorial polishing only.

     We will also look at enhanced modules papers and do
     interpretation work as time permits.

     Dan Nagle filled out the annual report and submitted it.
     We are on time and on target for meeting the WG5 schedule.

1.1.5  ISO/WG5 report                             Van Snyder, IR
     The WG5 meeting had 4 significant results.
         The informal language name is now Fortran 2003.
         One technical change made to TYPE SELECT and type name syntax
         We were asked to revisit interpretation JP-24.
         A large amount of editorial work, see this meeting's papers.

     WG5 also did some work on the sub-modules technical report;
     this is discussed below in /EM papers.

     He has a copy of a presentation by David Huff on status of
     standard.  They are still revisiting issues relevant to us.  It
     will become a post meeting paper on the server.  The IEEE group
     is meeting monthly and still making major changes.

1.1.10 Local arrangements                         M. North
     Described, but not noted

1.1.11 Comments from members

     Hirchert:  He is retiring October 1 and probably will not attend
     any more meetings.

30-Aug-2003                  Page  3 of 17                      03-252

     Maine:  Avoid "wordsmithing" improvements as much as possible.
     Often minor changes in wording have surprising technical content.
     Things passed on from WG5 are reasonable to look at; but, in
     general, avoid merely improving wording.  This document will
     effectively be the final standard.

     Long:  There has been discussion on the e-mail reflector about
     NaNs.  What we are doing is almost what C does.  They allow a
     leading minus  sign.

     Cohen: this is a deliberate decision at WG5 to NOT have signs on
     NaNs.

     /Interop will produce a NaN paper for a straw vote for the
     record.

     Snyder:  WG5 allows J3 to fix serious flaws at this meeting; just
     not to change things because we don't like them.

     North:  November meeting will probably be his last meeting.  We
     will need to find replacements for his jobs.
        A) Librarian - assign paper numbers, keep old files, etc.
        B) Server - Maintain the server and e-mail reflector.  The
           server will only be up until the end of the year.  We can
           have the machine, but we will have to take over running it,
           etc. or find an alternate way to keep papers.  It's easier
           if the server is run by the librarian.
        C) Treasurer - will need to open a bank account and get a
           credit card   We will need to look into details and laws
           about setting up non-profit organization, etc., to handle
           accounts since laws or NCITS rules may have changed since
           North set things up.  North will contact NCITS for info.
           The treasurer should also probably be local host to deal
           with Hotel, sign contracts, etc.
        D) Local host

     Maine:  We might be money and effort ahead to hire a commercial
             web-service rather than attempt to do it ourselves.

     North:  Today he finalized contract for November meeting at the
     Emerald Suites.  The November meeting will be a test of the
     facility.  North will keep contracts for future meetings at
     this hotel until we decide.  The rooms are smaller than here.

     Straw vote:
                Try Emerald suites for November        9
                Stay here                              4
                Undecided                              1
