-----------

In 5.4.7 Coarrays, paragraph 2 reads

"For each coarray on an image, there is a corresponding coarray with
the same type, type parameters, and bounds on every other image that
is in the same team."

It is a bit vague what "same team" means. For cases when an image
selector includes a TEAM= or TEAM_NUMBER= specifier that specifies a
team other than the current team, there is a requirement that there be
a corresponding coarray on an image that is not part of the current
team. On the other hand, for such an image selector to be valid, there
is a "same team" that is an ancestor of the current team, and where
the coarray is established in that team.


Edit to N2137:
--------------

[45:22] in 5.4.7 Coarrays, p2, replace

"that is in the same team"

by

"of a team in which it is established (5.4.8)".

{Making the paragraph read:

"For each coarray on an image, there is a corresponding coarray with
the same type, type parameters, and bounds on every other image of a
team in which it is established (5.4.8)." }
