Subject:   Assignment to zero-length character

1. Introduction
===============

Walt Brainerd observed that the final sentence of 7.2.1.13p1, viz.

     "No value is assigned to the variable if it is of type character
      and zero length, or is an array of size zero,"

could be construed to mean that this applies before consideration
whether the variable in an intrinsic assignment ought to the reallocated
because it is allocatable and has the wrong character length or the
wrong shape.

If the sentence were moved to be after the discussion of reallocation,
it would be clear that it applies to the variable after reallocation.

2. Edits
========

[158:12-13 7.2.1.13p1]  Move the final sentence of the paragraph to
[158:24-], i.e., between Note 7.35 and 7.2.1.3p4, making it a new
paragraph.
