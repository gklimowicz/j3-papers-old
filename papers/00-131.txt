2. Edits to 00-007

[33:35] Delete
  "Once a derived type is defined, an object may be declared to be of that
  type."
{Reason: This statement adds nothing correct to the standard that was not said
         2 lines earlier and this one is incorrect.
 An object can be declared to be of a derived type prior to the type
 definition - consider:
    TYPE(t) FUNCTION f()
      TYPE t
        SEQUENCE
        REAL value
      END TYPE
      ...
 The function statement declares the result variable "f" to be of derived type
 "t".}

[34:5] Delete "and type parameters" and change "determine" to "determines".
{Reason: The type parameters do not determine the operations that may be used.
         This edit returns the sentence to its F95 state.
         [Operations would be things like +, //, .EQ.; not whether it may be
          used as an actual argument to the PRESENT intrinsic etc.]}

[63:20] Delete.
{This was left over from a previous version of the syntax.  Its replacement is
 already present at 23-24.}

[237:22] Replace "Amodule" with "A module".
{Typo.}
