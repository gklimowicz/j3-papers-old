Discussion
----------

Interpretation F08/0008 failed WG5 ballot N1876.

Ballot comments
---------------

F08/0008
Cohen NO vote
The quoted text in 13.7.1 is just wrong and needs to be fixed.

Corbett NO vote
If the statement in the standard that "the flag IEEE_INVALID shall signal"
is, as is stated in the interpretation, is incorrect, the text of the
standard should be altered to reflect that.

Snyder NO vote
See answer to F03/0030.  There are no edits here, but arguing that the
requirement in 13.7.1p2 does not apply admits a contradiction.  My answer
would be yes if there were an edit causing the penultimate sentence of
13.7.1p2 to begin "If support is provided and an infinite result...."

Revised interpretation
----------------------

NUMBER: F08/0008
TITLE: IEEE exceptions for intrinsic functions
KEYWORDS: IEEE_INVALID, SQRT
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTIONS:

Section 13.7.1, page 325, lines 10-12 states

    If an infinite result is returned, the flag IEEE_OVERFLOW
    or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO shall signal; if a NaN result is
    returned, the flag IEEE_INVALID shall signal.

Question (1):
The Fortran 2008 standard does not require a standard-conforming
processor to support IEEE_INVALID [14.3p8, 404:15].  If a
processor does not support IEEE_INVALID, is it required to signal
IEEE_INVALID when a NaN result is returned?

Question (2):
IEC 60559 requires the result of SQRT(+inf) to be +inf without
overflow being signaled.  IEC 60559 requires SQRT(qNaN), where qNaN
is a quiet NaN, not to signal an invalid operand exception.  Does
Fortran 2008 require SQRT(QNaN) to signal IEEE_INVALID?

ANSWERS:

Question (1): No.  If the processor does not support IEEE_INVALID,
it cannot signal IEEE_INVALID.

Question (2): No.  The Fortran 2008 standard does not directly
specify the behavior of SQRT on qNaN.  If IEEE_SUPPORT_SQRT is
true for the kind of the argument, the behavior of SQRT is
governed by ISO/IEC 60559:1989, which does not allow INVALID to be
signaled.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

Replace the penultimate sentence of 13.7.1, viz. "If an infinite
result is returned, the flag IEEE_OVERFLOW or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO
shall signal; if a NaN result is returned the flag IEEE_INVALID
shall signal" with the following:

"If all real arguments are finite and IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is
true for those arguments, then
  o if the result is infinite, and
    IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG(IEEE_OVERFLOW) is true or
    IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG(IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO) is true, the flag
    IEEE_OVERFLOW or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO shall signal, or
  o if the result is NaN and IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG(IEEE_INVALID) is
    true, the flag IEEE_INVALID shall signal."
