TITLE: STORAGE_SIZE and unlimited polymorphic.
KEYWORDS: Intrinsic, Function
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider
  CLASS(*),POINTER :: p
  NULLIFY(p)
  PRINT *,STORAGE_SIZE(p)

Note that p does not have any deferred type parameters, so is not
prohibited from being a disassociated pointer in a reference to
STORAGE_SIZE.

Was this intended to be standard-conforming?
If so, what value would be printed?  Zero?

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit is
supplied to insert the missing prohibition.

EDITS to 10-007:

[390:6] In 13.7.160p3, argument A, before "has any deferred" insert
        "is unlimited polymorphic or",
        and after "type parameters" insert ",".
{Comma to make the sentence easier to read, not strictly necessary.}

That makes the whole sentence read:
  "If it is unlimited polymorphic or has any deferred type parameters,
   it shall not be an unallocated allocatable variable or a
   disassociated or undefined pointer."
