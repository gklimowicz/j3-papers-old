#Reference:

Discussion:
GB036 references section 13.8.7 "RU, RD, RZ, RN, RC, and RP editing"
and notes that the list of affected format descriptors does not include
the new EX.

Edit:

[283] "13.8.7 RU, RD, RZ, RN, RC, and RP editing" paragraph 1
Add "EX, " after "EN, ES, " in the final sentence in the paragraph,
making it read in its entirety:
"It affects only D, E, EN, ES, EX, F, and G editing."
