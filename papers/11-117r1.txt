DISCUSSION

Unresolved Technical Issue TR9 of N1838 asks for a note to be added to
explain that assumed rank is a Fortran concept and that in C code the
object will appear to have an explicit rank. It also asks for the note
to discuss the attributes of the object, but this seems unnecessary
since the attribute rules do not differ from those when the rank is
explicit.

EDIT to N1838:

2.2 Assumed-rank objects
[4:5+] At the end of the section, add

NOTE 2.1
Assumed-rank is an attribute of a Fortran dummy argument.  When a C
code is invoked with an actual argument that corresponds to an
assumed-rank dummy argument in a Fortran interface, the corresponding
formal parameter is a pointer to a descriptor of type CFI_cdesc_t (see
5.2.8). The rank component of the descriptor provides the rank of the
object that is associated with the actual argument in the environment
of the call, perhaps via other assumed-rank associations within the
call chain.  The C code must therefore be able to handle any rank, but
on each invocation, the rank will be available to it.
