OpenMP will be releasing 5.1 at Super Computing (SC) in 2020.
There will be a TR (TR8) released at SC this year, and a final comment
draft should be released in June or July of next year. There was a
face-to-face meeting last month in New Zealand in which quite a bit of
progress was made on various topics.

TR8 will include the following new features that should be available
in OpenMP 5.1:

* a new construct, interop, that enables interoperability with a
  foreign execution context (e.g. a CUDA stream)

* tile directive for directing the compiler to tile a loop nest.

* an assume directive for specifying invariants than the
  implementation can assume will hold, for enabling optimization.

* asynchronous versions of device memory routines

* environment variables for controlling execution behavior on
  accelerators

* a new construct, scope, that allows reductions to be defined in the
  middle of a parallel region

* support for indirect calls with function/procedure pointers in a
  target region

* extension for declare variants to enables functions defined in a
  section of code to only be invoked in a particular, specified
  context (e.g. specialized math functions to be used when called from
  a particular device)

Some other things that are likely to make it into 5.1, but not the TR:

* define behavior with BLOCK construct

* define behavior with  DO CONCURRENT

* allow array assignment according teams

* allow work-sharing for array assignment in a TEAMS construct, the
  way WORKSHARE presently allows it for a PARALLEL construct.

* unroll directive
