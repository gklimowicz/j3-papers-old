Subject: Atomic subroutine argument undefined

Discussion
----------

The first sentence of paragraph 4 of 7.2 we say that when an error
occurs the ATOM, EVENT, or OLD arguments of an atomic subroutine
become undefined. In the case of ATOMIC_REF (13.7.21, page 338 of
14-007r2), the ATOM argument is INTEINT(IN). Clearly in this case we
do not intend to have the ATOM argument become undefined.  The only
atomic subroutine with an EVENT argument is EVENT_QUERY (7.4.15 in
N2027) and in that case, the EVENT argument is also INTENT(IN).

Edits to N2027:

[17:28] After "atomic subroutine" insert ", other than ATOMIC_REF, ".

[17:29] Delete "EVENT,".

[17:31] Change "the argument" to "the STAT argument".
{Clarify that the "argument" here is the STAT argument from the
beginning of the sentence and not the ATOM or EVENT argument from
later in the sentence.}
