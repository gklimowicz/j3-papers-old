From: Steve Lionel & JOR
Subject: Connection Modes and Data Transfer Statements
Date: 2022-March-02

Reference: 22-007, 22-104, 21-201r1, 21-197, 21-177

Paper 21-201r1 attempted to clarify the behavior of connection modes
during child data transfer statements. In 22-104, the editor rejected
the majority of proposed edits and suggested an alternative. JOR finds
the suggested alternative acceptable.

Edits to 22-007
---------------
251:35-37 (12.6.4.8.3p2 Executing defined input/output data transfers)

Replace the last sentence (added by edits in 21-201r1) with:

"As a child data transfer statement and its corresponding parent data
transfer statement use the same file connection (12.5), the connection
modes at the beginning of execution of the child data transfer statement
are those in effect in the parent data transfer statement at the point
where the child data transfer statement was invoked."

The other edits from 21-201r1, rejected by the editor, are no longer
considered useful.
