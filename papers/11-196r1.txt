NUMBER: F08/0058
TITLE: ENTRY point RESULT variable
KEYWORDS: ENTRY, RESULT
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

MODULE m
  REAL x
CONTAINS
  FUNCTION f()
    f = 1
    x = 2
    RETURN
  ENTRY e() RESULT(x)
    x = 3
  END FUNCTION
END MODULE

Is this standard-conforming?

If so, what is the result of referencing f() and e(), and what effect
does that have on the module variable x?

Note that the standard prohibits dummy arguments of an entry point
from appearing in executable statements ahead of the ENTRY statement
(unless they are also dummy arguments of an earlier ENTRY statement or
the FUNCTION statement), but makes no similar requirement on the
RESULT name.

ANSWER:

This program was not meant to be conforming.

An edit is provided to correct this mistake in the standard.

EDIT:

Append new statement to 12.6.2.6p8 [310:20],
  "A name that appears as a <result-name> in an ENTRY statement
   shall not appear in any executable statement that precedes the
   first RESULT clause with that name."

Append new statement to 12.6.2.6p9 [310:23]
  "A name that appears as a <result-name> in an ENTRY statement
   shall not appear in the expression of a statement function that
   precedes the first RESULT clause with that name unless the name is
   also a dummy argument of that statement function."
