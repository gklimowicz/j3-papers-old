   "T1: When a block of code is executed on images executing as a team,"

T2. Replace by

    "T2: While an image executes a statement it shall be a member of one
    and only one team. Access to variables on images of an ancestor team
    is permitted through syntax that refers to that team."

    "There shall be a construct mechanism for changing the current
    team, involving the synchronization of all members of the new team
    at the beginning and end of the construct."
