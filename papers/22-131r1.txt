To: J3                                                     J3/22-131r1
From: Brian Friesen
Subject: Desired meeting format for J3 meeting #227
Date: 2022-February-28

ISO guidance allows convenors to call hybrid (virtual + in-person) meetings
at their discretion; purely in-person meetings require ISO approval at this
time. It is possible that future meetings will continue to be allowed the
option of being held virtually, even if hybrid or in-person meetings are
permitted.

Since J3 meeting #227 will be held jointly with WG5, J3 should decide what
meeting format it would like to have for #227, subject to updated guidance
from ISO and/or INCITS between now and meeting #227.
