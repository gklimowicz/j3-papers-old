Subject: JP-15: Result of IEEE_COPY_SIGN
Date: 2010 February 01

This paper provides edits for comment JP-15 from the Ballot summary,
N1802.

Discussion:

The Result Value section of the description of the IEEE_COPY_SIGN
intrinsic function says the result "has the value of X with the sign
of Y". The Ballot comment proposes that specifically saying "the
absolute value of X" would be clearer.

Additional comment not in Ballot: The phrase "The result has the value
of" is generally a unitary phrase in Result Value sections, after
which the actual value is specified. If that convention is followed
here, then an alternate edit would be needed.

Alternate Edit:

absolute value of ".
