QUESTION: There appears to be no explicit requirement that the
<variable>s in R736 and R741 be scalar.  If data-pointer-object
and proc-component ref were data-refs, then C614 would prohibit
the <variable>s from being arrays.  However, although the syntax
looks like a special case of a data-ref, nothing appears to say
that R736 and R741 actually constitute data-refs.

The standard gives no interpretation as to what the meaning
would be in the case of an array.

Even when variable is a scalar, the standard does not appear to
define what the properties (such as type and shape) of a
data-pointer-object or proc-pointer-object are in the case where
the syntax has a "%".  All we have is a syntax with no
established meaning.

Q1. Is the <variable> in R736 or R741 allowed to be an array?

Q2. Is the interpretation of the forms in R736 and R741 the
    same as that of a data-ref?

ANSWER:

A1. No.  The standard provides no interpretation of what such
    a form would mean.  Therefore, by the first sentence of
    1.5, it is not standard-conforming.  Edits are provided to
    make this prohibition more direct.

A2. Yes.
