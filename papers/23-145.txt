The MPI Forum continues its march to finalize MPI 4.1.
Two tickets related to Fortran that have passed their
first vote are:

 1. MPI will refer to Fortran 2018 instead of Fortran
    2008 + TS 29113 where appropriate, which reflects
    the current state of Fortran.

 2. The mpif.h interface will be deprecated.  This
    interace has many flaws (listed in the MPI document).
    The API will still be available from mpi.mod,
    which we cannot deprecate even though mpi_f08.mod
    is unconditionally better.

The ABI standardization effort targeting MPI-5 is going
well.  This is currently focused on the C language API
but has many positive benefits for implementing
Fortran 20*8 support as a standalone library, which
is being attempted in https://github.com/jeffhammond/vapaa.
