TITLE: IEEE Inquiry Functions
DEFECT TYPE: DEFECT
STATUS: Initial submission

On comp.lang.fortran Francis Coudert asked

"The Fortran 2008 standard defines an inquiry function
as an "intrinsic function, or function in an intrinsic
module, whose result depends on the properties of one
or more of its arguments instead of their values".

I wonder: by that definition, how can the
IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING(FLAG) function from the
IEEE_EXCEPTIONS intrinsic module be an inquiry function?
Its result depends on the value of FLAG, not its
properties."

Question 1.
Are the functions

IEEE_support_flag
IEEE_support_halting
IEEE_support_rounding
c_associated
c_funloc
c_loc
(and possibly other intrinsic functions)

intended to be inquiry functions?

Question 2.

Are they consistent with the definition of Inquiry
functions?

Question 3.

Are they allowed in Specification expressions?

Question 4.

Are they allowed in Constant expressions?
