Discussion

One of the major problems in constructing a set of sensible MPI
interfaces for Fortran is the combinatorial explosion due to
combinations of TKR (type, kind, and rank).  This problem is made
worse by F2008 with up to 15 possible dimensions.

Changes to Fortran in N1761 will solve this problem for Fortran users
who wish access to dope vectors.  This is provided through the

   TYPE(*), DIMENSION(..)

syntax.  However, users (library implementors) who don't want the
added complexity of processing dope vectors still have the explosion
of interfaces due to rank.  For example, the following interface
declaration

INTERFACE MPI_Recv
subroutine MPI_Recv_wrapper(buf, count, datatype, ...)
  TYPE(*), DIMENSION(*), intent(out)  :: buf
  ...
end subroutine
END INTERFACE

won't allow assumed-shape or assumed-size actuals of rank greater than
one.

To overcome this oversight in N1761, the following additional syntax
is proposed:

TYPE(*), DIMENSION(**)

consistent with the DIMENSION(..) syntax.  Semantically, this would
allow any actual of any type, kind, and rank (greater than or equal to
one) to be matched for the purpose of generic resolution.
