Subject: Misc edits in Sections 8-12

Edits to 02-007.


1) Note 9.37 seems directly related to the constraints at the beginning
of section 9.5.2.

Edit: Move [185:Note 9.37] to [184:5+]


2) The wording in [235:4-5]  could be more direct.

Edit: Replace [235:4-5] with "This section describes main programs,
modules, and block data program units. Section 12 describes external
program units."


3) The specification for modules in 11.2 includes terms that are
specific to modules but specified only on page 10.  In similar cases we
replicate the specifications that appear in section 2.1 and use the
larger rule numbers in 2.1.  The text would be more clear if we did the
same thing here.

Edit: Copy [10:29-33] to [236:12+] and renumber the rules in [10:29] and
[10:32] to R1107 and R1108.


4) In the text we refer to the mechanism for translating and executing
the Fortran program as the "processor" and refer to the related C or
other processor as the "companion processor".  The last line of Note
12.33 uses the term "companion processor" in a discussion of the VALUE
attribute, which is no longer tied to C interop.

Edit: In [255:Note 12.33, last line] delete "companion"

5) (from Van) Where does a procedure need to have an explicit interface?
Subgroup believes only where it is referenced.

Edit: [243:18] add "it is referenced and" at end of line

6) (from Rob) Interp f90/211 clarifies that the same procedure name
cannot be specified more than once in a generic interface, even
if that interface was use-associated.

Edit: [245:4-5] Replace constraint with:
A <procedure-name> shall not specify a procedure that is specified
previously in any <procedure-stmt> in any accessible interface
block with the same generic identifier.
