1. Edits w.r.t. 07-007r2

[311:7]-------------------------------------------------------------------
There are names in FUNCTION statements that are not dummy arguments, but
not vice-versa.  Editor: Insert "as a <dummy-arg-name>" after "appears".

[319 Note 12.8]-----------------------------------------------------------
The second paragraph isn't quite accurate any more, and it's not worth
clarifying and correcting it.  Editor: Delete it.

[320:20,321:6,12,15]------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "with" by "from" four times.

[323:11,12,14-17,19]------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "<proc-entity-name>" by "<procedure-entity-name>" seven
times.

[323:19-20]---------------------------------------------------------------
Can't work, e.g., if both functions are character functions, each having a
length that depends upon a dummy argument.
Editor: Replace "they ... value" by "their results shall have the same
characteristics".

[329 Note 12.24]----------------------------------------------------------
Note 12.24 appears not to be germane to anything nearby.  Editor: Move
Note 12.24 to [328:17-].

[331:1-2]-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hard to read. Editor: Insert "a pointer array, or" after "be" and delete
"or a pointer array".

[333:19-20]---------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "the characterists ... for" by "its characteristics as a
procedure (12.3.1) shall be the same as those of".  Delete the redundant
"and the corresponding dummy argument".

[334:5]-------------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "12.5" (which is a large subclause including the present
sentence) by "R1224" [alt-return-spec].

[334:22]------------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert "array" after "assumed-size".

[334:36]------------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert "present" before first "pointer".

[338:19]------------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete "are".

[339:3]-------------------------------------------------------------------
Delete the unnecessary cross reference to 5.3.8.

[343:8,345:2,346:20-22]---------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete C1255 [343:8] and C1259 [345:2] because they're covered by
C1265 at [346:20-22].

[343:15]------------------------------------------------------------------
"Declaration part" isn't a defined term.  Editor: Replace "declaration
part" by "specification part".

[348:6]-------------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "executing" to "execution of" for consistency with
[348:5].

[348:36-349:1]------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete the constraint because it doesn't constrain anything.

[350:1-8]-----------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Add the enumerated list to the appearance of C1283 in Annex E.

[350:15]------------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert "or <allstop-stmt>" at the end.  Also insert before
"<arithmetic-if-stmt>" twice at [199:17,31].

==========================================================================

2. Comments and questions without answers or edits

[312:30-31]---------------------------------------------------------------
Are the type and type parameters of a dummy function that has implicit
interface characteristics?

[315:25-26]---------------------------------------------------------------
C1209 prohibits

  interface A
    procedure :: B, B
  end interface A

but nothing prohibits

  interface A
    subroutine B ( ... )
    ...
    end subroutine B
    procedure :: B
  end interface A

Does this need an interp?

[348:22]------------------------------------------------------------------
What does it mean for a primary to be an intrinsic operation?  Actually,
the entire constraint is seriously broken.

[350:16]------------------------------------------------------------------
Should C1288 be replaced by adding "co-indexed object" to the list in
C1283?
