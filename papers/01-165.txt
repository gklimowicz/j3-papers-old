The revision consists of improving (fixing) the wording of the edits.

NUMBER: 000081
TITLE: Definition status of derived-type objects with pointer components
KEYWORDS: Definition status, Derived type, Pointer component
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress
QUESTION:

Consider:
        TYPE t
          REAL,POINTER :: x
        END TYPE
        TYPE(t) var1,var2
        NULLIFY(var1%x)
        var2 = var1     ! Unfortunate.

According to 14.7.1,
  "An object is defined if and only if all of its subobjects are defined."

from which I conclude that the program fragment above is not conforming.

Should the definition status of an object contain pointer components depend
on the pointer association status of its pointer components and not their
definition status?

ANSWER:

Yes.  Edits are supplied to clarify this situation.

EDITS:

[288:17] Replace with
  "(1) An array is defined if and only if all of its elements are defined.

   (2) A derived-type scalar object is defined if and only if all of its
       nonpointer components are defined and all of its pointer components
have
       a pointer association status of associated or disassociated.

   (3) A complex or character scalar object is defined if and only if all of
       its subobjects are defined."
{New definition of "defined"/"undefined" for things that have subobjects.}

[288:18-19] Replace "(2)" with "(4)".
{This comment is still true even if completely redundant.
 It would not hurt to delete it.  It probably doesn't belong in the above
 list anyway.}
