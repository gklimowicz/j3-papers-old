At meeting 177 only the "Simple editorial corrections" sections of
06-210r2 were processed. Here I resubmit:
1) Requests to clarify or change wording
2) Technical issues

[34:26-27] C313 needs to be rewritten so that it does not have three
negatives:
"If the first token is MACRO the second token shall be not be a
keyword or name."
Question: Can the first <result-token> be DEFINE or EXPAND? If yes, then why are
these separate items in the BNF for R322? The way things are it is
ambiguous whether a statement
DEFINE MACRO ...
is a <macro-body-stmt> or a <macro-definition>.
As a specific example, can a macro define a macro with a variable number
of arguments, where the number of arguments is an argument of the
top-level macro?

[Annex C]
There is a clear provision for macros defining macros. Here is
an attempt at an example of using such a macro---to be included in
a Note or Annex C:

---------
! Macro that defines a macro which assigns a value to an array element
DEFINE MACRO :: assign_shortcut(rank)
   DEFINE MACRO assign_%%rank(array,indices,value)
      MACRO INTEGER :: i
      array(indices(1)&&
      MACRO DO i=2,rank
           ,indices(i)&&
      MACRO END DO
            )=value
   END MACRO assign_%%rank
END MACRO assign_shortcut

! Create assignment macros for all ranks
MACRO DO i=1,15
   EXPAND assign_shortcut(i)
MACRO END DO

! Now use the rank-3 assignment macro:
REAL :: A(10,10,10)
INTEGER :: indices(3)=[1,5,6]
EXPAND assign_3(A,indices,5.0)
! Expands to:
! A(indices(1),indices(2),indices(3))=5.0
---------

[36:30] I find "statement-dependent" in item (3) too vague---maybe say
"Macro statement processing". The expansion of macros is in a sense
iterative, expanding MACRO and EXPAND statements until there are
none left to expand. This was not really clear to me from reading
the description.

[38:5-6] I believe that we should be specific that token replacement
and concatenation are the ONLY forms of expansion that occur.
