Subject: Interpretation concerning the TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED
From: Van Snyder
Date: 2010 June 15

------------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F08/0004
TITLE: Is TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED a pointer or nonpointer dummy
KEYWORDS: TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Under consideration

QUESTION:

Is the following conforming, and if so what does it print?

  program TARGET_Arg
    integer, pointer :: Pointer
    integer, pointer :: Target => NULL()
    integer, target :: AnotherTarget
    pointer => anotherTarget
    print *, Associated(pointer,target)
  end program TARGET_Arg

DISCUSSION:

Subclause 13.7 stipulates that descriptions of arguments of intrinsic
procedures apply to actual arguments.  This leaves open the question
whether the TARGET dummy argument of ASSOCIATED is a pointer or not.

If not a pointer, being optional, it is considered by subclause
12.5.2.12 to be absent if the corresponding actual argument is
disassociated.

Thereby, the result value of ASSOCIATED (by Case(i) of the result
value clause) is true.

If the TARGET dummy argument is a pointer, the result value of
ASSOCIATED (by Case (iv) of the result value clause) is false.

ANSWER:

It is intended that the program is conforming and prints F.

Edits are provided to clarify this.

NOTE: This subsumes interp F08/0005 (10-152).

EDITS to 10-007:

[330:8] Fix the description to read
  "Query pointer association status".

Change the description of the interface to state explicitly that the
TARGET dummy argument has the POINTER and INTENT(IN) attributes.  A
nonpointer actual argument is now permitted by 12.5.2.7p2 to
correspond to an INTENT(IN) pointer dummy argument, whereupon the
dummy argument becomes pointer associated with the actual argument.
The result is that a disassociated TARGET actual argument cannot be
considered to be absent.

[13.7.16p3 330:14]
Before "If TARGET" insert "The dummy argument TARGET has the POINTER
and INTENT(IN) attributes."  Replace "TARGET" by "the actual argument".

[13.7.16p3 330:15+]
Insert a note:
  "NOTE 13.8a
   This requires the actual argument for TARGET to have the POINTER or
   TARGET attribute.  If the actual argument is not a pointer, the
   dummy argument TARGET is associated with the actual argument
   (12.5.2.7)."

[13.7.16p5 Cases (iv) and (v) 330:23-29]
Delete Cases (iv) and (v) because they will be subsumed be the revisions
of cases (vi) and (vii).

[13.7.16p5 Case (vi) 330:30]
Replace "a scalar pointer" by "scalar".

[13.7.16p5 Case (vii) 330:33]
Delete "pointer".
