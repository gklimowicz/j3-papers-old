QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      MODULE m
        TYPE t
          INTEGER i
        CONTAINS
          FINAL :: finalizeT
        END TYPE
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE finalizeT(obj)
          TYPE(t) :: obj(:)
          PRINT *, 'Finalizing a rank-1 array of type t'
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

      PROGRAM foo
        USE m
        TYPE(t) :: a
        a%i = 5
        PRINT *, (/ (a, i=1,5) /)
      END PROGRAM

If the PRINT statement in the main program was printing a function
result or a structure constructor, rather than an array constructor,
it is clear that the object should be finalized after that PRINT
statement.

However, for array constructors, this does not appear to be the case.
In the main program above, should the entity created by the array
constructor be finalized after execution of the PRINT statement?

ANSWER:

Yes, the array constructor should be finalized.  Edits are provided to
correct this oversight.

EDITS:
All edits refer to 04-007.

[59:28+]  Add a new paragraph:
    If an executable construct references an array constructor, the
    entity created by the array constructor is finalized after
    execution of the innermost executable construct containing the
    reference.

[59:31-]  Add a new paragraph:
    If a specification expression in a scoping unit references an
    array constructor, the entity created by the array constructor is
    finalized before execution of the executable constructs in the
    scoping unit.
