5.2 Closing business

   Discussion: should we keep "part II" of the Fortran Standard, ie,
               "Variable Length Character Module"?
   Consensus: better off deleting it

5.3 Review of action items

   1) Stan Whitlock will send the J3 minutes 15-256 to Lynn Barra
      (lbarra@itic.org)

   2) Malcolm Cohen is planning to have a new 16-007 by the end of 2015

   3) Stan Whitlock will run a J3 meeting letter ballot on interps that
      are awaiting processing

   4) For the next meeting (m209, Las Vegas, February, 2016), we will
      move to A/B/C groups for reviewing the draft: 

        Group A (JoR):  Chapters 8 - 12 
        Group B (Data): Chapter 13 - Annex C
        Group C (HPC):  Introduction - Chapter 7

        Everyone should look for processor dependencies not in the
        Introduction and should be critical of the content of Annex C

      Some instructions from the editor:

        (1) editing instructions should give the whole subclause heading
            and paragraph number (you can say "same subclause" if it's the
            same as the previous edit)
        (2) when moving/deleting, please include the first few and last
            few words of the text to be moved/deleted
        (3) NOTEs are not numbered in the source so they also need
            context and/or contents
        (4) BNF rules should give the name not just the number

        This will help the editor to work efficiently and reduce the
        likelihood of an editing mistake
