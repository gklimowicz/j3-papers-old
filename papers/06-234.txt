---------------------

In the last example of C.3.1, the line with the comment 

!Nested form constructor

is not conforming.  With a parent component in the constructor, 
keywords are required.  See Note 4.61 at [77:11+].

Edit:
-----

[538:33] Replace

"COLOR_POINT(PV,3)"  with

"COLOR_POINT(POINT=PV, COLOR=3)".
