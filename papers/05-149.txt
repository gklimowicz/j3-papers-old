A pointer with the SEQUENCE attribute must point to a contiguous
target.

Title: sequence pointers

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: J3/04-132

Basic Functionality:

Rationale: Many unnecessary operations, especially copies, happen because
           compilers must have a data item occupying contiguous memory.
	   For example, contiguous memory is needed to pass an array to
	   a procedure with an implicit interface.  Thus, the mere use
	   of pointers often results in substantially suboptimal code.
	   If the compiler knew that the pointer was constrained to point
	   to contiguous memory, very much better code could be generated.

Estimated Impact: the effort was estimated as 5 on the John Reid scale at M167.

Detailed Specification: Provide a way to specify that a pointer will only
                        be associated with a target occupying a storage
			sequence.  For example, a SEQUENCE keyword may appear
			on the pointer's declaration statement.  Thus,

			real, pointer, sequence :: sptr

			Alternatively, the pointer keyword might be omitted,
			since this proposal only allows SEQUENCE on POINTER
			declarations.  However, this may not be desirable
			if other objects, such as dummy arguments, might
			eventaully be allowed ot have the sequence keyword.
