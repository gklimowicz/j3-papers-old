From:    David Muxworthy
Subject: UK proposal UK-13 Formatted I/O error conditions
Date: 2014 June 24


Status: For Consideration
Basic Functionality:  Standardize certain I/O error conditions

Comment:
This proposal refers only to numeric or logical input errors.
It could be extended to other I/O errors.

Rationale:
Standardize certain I/O error conditions so as to allow a
standard-conforming program to regain control after an error.

Specification:
If during formatted input a character input for numeric or
logical editing is not acceptable to the processor, an error
occurs.

Syntax:
No syntax change.

Edits to J3/14-007r1(= N2014):

[xviii] Introduction: Add to the bullet "Input/output" the sentence
"An error occurs if unacceptable characters are input for numeric or
logical editing in a formatted input statement."

[197] Add a new paragraph 2 to 9.2.2 Formatted record as follows:
"If during execution of a formatted input statement, a character is
input for numeric or logical editing that is not acceptable to the
processor, an error occurs."

[240:29] In 9.11.1 General, replace "The" by "Except as identified
in subclause 9.2.2, the".
