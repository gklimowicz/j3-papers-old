Subject: deleting arithmetic if (UK-10a)
Date: 2013 September 0

Reference: N1982

UK-10 subitem a., accepted at Delft, is to delete
the arithmetic if statement.  This paper proposes
specifications, syntax, and edits to do so.

Specification:
The Arithmetic IF statement is deleted in f15.

Syntax:
IF( <scalar-numeric-expr> ) lbl_1, lbl_2, lbl_3
is no longer valid Fortran.

Edits: {against 10-007r1}

{remove from ToC}

[vii] delete the line 8.2.4 Arithmetic IF statement

{remove from definition of branch target statement}

[4:39] delete "arithmetic IF statement,"

{remove from list of <action-stmt> R214}

[30:6] delete "<<or>> <arithmetic-if-stmt>,"

{remove from discussion of real zero}

[54:17] change ", and" to "."

[54:18] delete bullet item "as the <scalar-numeric-expr>
in an arithmetic IF."

{remove from constraint C816 on terminal statements of non-block DO}

[175:14] change "an <arithmetic-if-stmt," to "a"

{remove from constraint C818 on terminal statements of non-block DO}

[175:27] change "an <arithmetic-if-stmt," to "a"

{remove from discussion of Branch Concepts}

[187:1] delete "an arithmetic IF statement,"

{remove subclaus 8.2.4}

[187:20-28] delete subclaus 8.2.4 including note 8.28

{add to deleted features}

[463:34+] insert new numbered item "(7) Arithmetic IF statement

The arithmetic IF statement is incompatible with IEEE 754
and necessarily involves the use of statement labels;
Statement labels can hinder optimization,
and make code hard to read and maintain.  Similar logic
can be more clearly encoded using other choice statements."

{remove from Obsolescent Features}

[464:6] delete item (1)

{remove from index}

[586] delete "arithmetic IF statement 187, 187"
and "<arithmetic-if-stmt> (R853), 30, 175, 187, 187"
