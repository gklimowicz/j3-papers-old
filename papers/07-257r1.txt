Subject: UTI 125 (p32): Corresponding co-array for dummy co-arrays
Date: 2007 Aug 9
References: J3/07-007r2 (N1678)


Discussion

The Editor questions the statement at [32:16-17]:
"For each co-array on an image, there is a corresponding co-array
with the same type, type parameters, and bounds on every other image."
for dummy co-arrays.

We believe that the problem lies in Notes 12.31 and 12.32 and provide
edits to these notes.

Edits to 07-007r2:

[332:31+] In 12.5.2.9 Co-array arguments, NOTE 12.31, replace the
first two sentences by

    "The co-array on the executing image is specified as the actual
     argument and is associated with the dummy co-array argument on
     this image. For this image, there is a corresponding co-array
     with the same type, type parameters, and bounds on every other
     image, because there is a co-array corresponding to the ultimate
     argument on all the other images."

[333:1-] In 12.5.2.9 Co-array arguments, NOTE 12.32, replace the first
 sentence by

    "If a procedure with a nonallocatable co-array dummy argument is
    invoked by more than one image in unordered segments, each such
    invocation has its own dummy co-array and the bounds and co-bounds
    of these dummy arrays may differ from invocation to invocation."
