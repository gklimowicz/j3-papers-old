Subject: Fix constants in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.
Date: 2009 February 11


1. Introduction

Some constants in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV have wording that differs unnecessarily
from the majority style.  Also, the array constants do not have their rank
specified.  And they do not have their bounds specified!  Finally, the
constants are not in alphanumeric order.  Post-finally, "with blah
components" does not clearly specify "no non-blah components".


2. Edits to 09-007

[402:18] In 13.8.2.4 CHARACTER_KINDS,
  Change "named constant array" -> "array constant",
[402:20]
  Change "size of the array"
  to "rank of the array is one, its lower bound is one, and its size",
This makes the whole paragraph read:
  "The values of the elements of the default integer array constant
   CHARACTER KINDS are the kind values supported by the processor for
   variables of type character.  The order of the values is processor
   dependent. The rank of the array is one, its lower bound is one, and its
   size is the number of character kinds supported.".

[403:27-] 13.8.2.12 INT8 et al will be moved to here, see later.

[403:28] In 13.8.2.11 INTEGER_KINDS,
  Change "named constant array" -> "array constant",
[403:29-30]
  Change "size of the array"
  to "rank of the array is one, its lower bound is one, and its size".

[404:2] In 13.8.2.12 INT8 et al, delete "named",
        then move to [403:27-] i.e. preceding INTEGER_KINDS.

[404:20] In 13.8.2.16 LOCK_TYPE,
  Delete "nonpointer, nonallocatable, noncoarray",
  After "components" change "." to
    "; no component is allocatable or a pointer".
{We don't need to forbid coarray components since they are necessarily
 allocatable, and doing so redundantly would complicate the sentence.}

[405:2] In 13.8.2.17 LOGICAL_KINDS,
  Change "named constant array" -> "array constant",
[405:3-4]
  Change "size of the array"
  to "rank of the array is one, its lower bound is one, and its size".

[405:13] In 13.8.2.20 REAL_KINDS,
  Change "named constant array" -> "array constant",
[405:14-15]
  Change "size of the array"
  to "rank of the array is one, its lower bound is one, and its size".
