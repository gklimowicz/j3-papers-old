Subject: F edit descriptor with field width 0
Date: 2006 January 30

NUMBER: F03/0081
TITLE: F edit descriptor with field width 0
KEYWORDS: Data edit descriptors, F edit descriptor, field width
DEFECT TYPE: CLARIFICATION/ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

    Does the Fortran 2003 standard allow the output
    field produced by an F edit descriptor with a
    field width w whose value is zero for a real
    value whose magnitude is less than one to
    include an optional leading zero?

    For example, is the PRINT statement

          PRINT '(F0.2)', 0.01

    allowed to write "0.01"?

ANSWER: No.  This is clear from Section 10.6.1 of the
        Fortran 2003 standard, item (6).

DISCUSSION: 
        This question came from a customer.

        Many implementations, including Sun's, include the
        optional leading zero.

EDITS:  None required.
