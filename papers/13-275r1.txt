Discussion
----------

It was intended that SYNC TEAM be restricted in its effects to images 
of the current team, but this is not clearly stated. If we alter the
CHANGE TEAM construct to involve synchronizations of each subteam
separately, we may want SYNC TEAM to be restricted to any ancestor
team, rather than to the currect team. 

Edits to N1967:
---------------   

Alternative 1

[10:26-27] Replace the first sentence after R507 with:

"The value of <team-variable> shall have been established by an
execution of FORM SUBTEAM by the current team.
Execution of a SYNC TEAM statement performs a synchronization 
of the images in the subteam that includes the executing image
and is specified by <team_variable>. 

[10:28] Replace "specified team" by "subteam".
