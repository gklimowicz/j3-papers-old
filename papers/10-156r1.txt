NUMBER: F03/0009
TITLE: Is ABS ever required to be the optional IEC 60559 abs?
KEYWORDS: ABS, IEEE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Are there any circumstances where the Fortran standard requires
the intrinsic function ABS to be compliant with the function abs
described in the optional portion of IEC 60559?

ANSWER:

No, the Fortran standard does not require the intrinsic function
abs to be compliant with the function abs described in IEC 60559.

DISCUSSION:

The example given in Section 14.11.3, page 409, line 26 will be
incorrect for some implementations of ABS if ABS is not required
to comply with the function abs specified in the optional portion
of IEC 60559.

EDITS to 10-007:

None.
