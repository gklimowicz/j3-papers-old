Discussion
----------
If TEAM_NUMBER is invoked for the initial team, the value returned is
-1, which is not valid as a team number in an image selector or an
invocation of IMAGE_INDEX or NUM_IMAGES.

[xx bullet starting on xix in Introduction, Features previously
described by ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015:] Add following sentence before
sentence starting "The new intrinsic subroutines CO_BROADCAST,..."

   "Additionally, the team number for the initial team is now allowed
    in image selectors, and in the intrinsic functions NUM_IMAGES and
    IMAGE_INDEX."

{Note that this is a technical change from the TS}

[22:36] In 3.145.4 definition of the term "team number", replace the
        definition with "-1, which identifies the initial team, or
        positive integer that identifies a team within its parent
        team".

{Change definition of team number to establish -1 as the team number of
 the initial team.}

[140:2] In 9.6 Image selectors, para 3, before the final sentence, add
        "If a TEAM_NUMBER=specifier appears in an <image-selector> and the
        current team is the initial team, the value of scalar-<int-expr>
        shall be the team number for the initial team; the object shall be
        an established coarray in the initial team."

{Define behavior of a TEAM_NUMBER appearing in an image selector when
the current team is the initial team.}


[394:11] In 16.9.97 IMAGE_INDEX (COARRAY, SUB) ..., para TEAM_NUMBER,
         change

         "a positive integer scalar. If the current team is not the
          initial team, it shall identify"
       to
         "an integer scalar. It shall identify the initial team or"

{Allow initial team number, -1, in IMAGE_INDEX intrinsic.}

[415:26] In 16.9.145 NUM_IMAGES ( ) ..., para 3, TEAM_NUMBER, change

         "a positive integer scalar. If the current team is not the
          initial team, it shall identify"
       to
         "an integer scalar. It shall identify the initial team or"

{Allow initial team number, -1, in NUM_IMAGES intrinsic.)

[434:24] In 16.9.189 TEAM_NUMBER([TEAM]), p5, change the beginning of
         the Result Value from "If the specified team is the initial
         team, the result value is -1; otherwise, the" to "The".

{Remove redundant -1 for the special case of the initial team.}
