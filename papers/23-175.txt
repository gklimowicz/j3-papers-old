Introduction
-----------
This paper describes the BITS type as a proposed feature for F202Y.
Historically the BITS type was already included in a draft of Fortran 2008
before being removed from its final inclusion.

A BITS data type is useful for non-numeric programming and enhance handling
of binary, octal, and hexadecimal constants. The BITS type has a set of
values composed of ordered sequences of bits. The number of bits in the
sequence is specified by the kind type parameter.
