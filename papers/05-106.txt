KEYWORDS:
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

Section 4.5.3.3 [52:5-7] of 04-007 indicates that passed-object dummy
arguments are relevant for both type-bound procedurs and procedure
pointer components. However, section 12.4.1.1 [268:17-19] of 04-007 on
the passed-objecxt dummy argument and argument association mentions
only type-bound procedures.  Should procedure pointer components also
be mentioned in 12.4.1.1?

ANSWER:

Yes. This was an omission in section 12.4.1.1.

EDITS:

[268:17] After "procedure" insert " or a procedure pointer component"
