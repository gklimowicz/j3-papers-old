X3J3 Member References




This is an attempt to consolidate various pieces of information that
have been written down to guide new and current members of our
committee.  It was initially based on the following two documents:

Documents Relevant to New Members by Maureen Hoffert.

Suggestions for X3J3 Meeting Hosts by Maureen Hoffert and last
updated by Hank Lauson.

This version adds the new Policy Concerning Exemptions from Meeting Fees
(X3J3/94-187).


Policy Concerning Exemptions from Meeting Fees

The current X3J3 meeting fee is $100.00 per meeting.  The meeting fee is
used exclusively for the expenses of the meetings; e.g., room rental,
refreshments, reproduction expenses, rental of office equipment, etc.
In no case are meeting fees used to purchase durable goods.  The meeting
fee is not a membership fee, nor does it cover the ongoing expenses of
the committee such as mailings or travel expenses.  The committee does
not receive any regular outside support or subsidy for the meeting
expenses; they are defrayed entirely by the meeting fee.  Thus, it is
the policy of X3J3 that all attendees at regularly scheduled meetings
contribute the full meeting fee to the best of their ability,  even when
they are not in attendance for the entire meeting.

Exemptions can be granted at each meeting by a vote of the full
committee.  In general, exemptions are reserved for attendees who have a
particular immediate financial problem (such as temporary loss of
support).  Attendees who are granted an exemption from the meeting fee
are encouraged to donate whatever they can afford toward the meeting
expenses.  Such donations will be used primarily to defray reproduction
costs.  Exempted attendees are encouraged to provide their own breakfast
and refreshments, and to exhibit economy in other areas such as
accommodations and transportation.

As an alternative to an exemption, an attendee may request (on a first-
come- first-served basis) to use the hospitality suite as their hotel
accommodations. Such a request should be addressed to the meeting host
at least two weeks prior to the meeting.  The meeting host should
determine whether the hotel management will allow occupancy of the room
before granting the request.  If the request is granted, that attendee
is expected to pay the full meeting fee, and is encouraged to assist in
the maintenance of that room and to help oversee/operate/maintain any of
the rented or donated office equipment residing in that room.

Visitors who are attending a meeting as official observers with the
intent of joining the committee are expected to pay the full meeting
fee, and may participate in the refreshments and receive copies of all
paper work generated at the meeting.  Invited speakers, and visitors
such as officials from CBEMA or ANSI, are exempted from the meeting fee
and are invited to participate in the refreshments.  Uninvited (drop-in)
visitors who are not planning to join the committee are exempted from
the meeting fee, unless they wish to consume refreshments or obtain
copies of the paperwork generated at the meeting.

Suggestions for X3J3 Meeting Hosts


I.	Task Checklist and Suggested Schedules
A.	Accommodations
1.	Room arrangements for meeting rooms and members' hotel
rooms
Hotel Rooms:
-	arrange for hotel to provide a block of rooms for
members to stay for 30 - 35 people based on past
meetings.  (This could change over time).
-	arrange for discount with hotel if possible for
members' room rates; arrange for both single and double
room rates
	Meeting Rooms:
-	meeting room should be able to seat about 30 people,
currently, at an oblong table with enough room for
papers. (30" deep, 36"/person?)
-	meeting room should have extra tables upon which to
place document distributions (30" deep, 18' long?)
-	meeting room should have overhead projector and screen
for transparencies (foils) and slide projector if
required
-	arrange for break-out rooms for subgroup meetings (if
too expensive we often use the meeting room itself, the
FIDS room and members' hotel rooms)
-	arrange for a FIDS room (for informal get-together
before dinner and where computer(s), printer(s), and
copier(s) can be set up)
-	Determine meeting expenses to be charged to X3J3
members.  X3J3 just voted to raise this fee to $100
(US); in the past it was $80.00
2.	Reservation information
-	Notify membership on deadlines, information and method
for making reservations
B.	Meeting Arrangements
1.	Notices
-	Send all information for Meeting Notice Distribution to
Chair and Vice-Chair no later than 8 weeks before a
meeting:

	Meeting Title
	Meeting Place (Complete address, phone and fax)
	Hotel (Complete address, phone and fax)
	Meeting Fee ($100.00)
	Host Name (Complete address, phone, email address and
fax)

	NOTE:  X3 Rules requires that a meeting notice MUST be
distributed 4 weeks before a meeting!

-	Make sure any registration deadlines are well
publicized to the membership
-	Send to the membership any travel information to both
hotel and to meeting location; include time involved
for travel and include any parking information if
necessary
-	Send all meeting information to email list; official
notifications will be sent with meeting notice and
agenda
-	Announce arrangements at earlier X3J3 meetings so
members can begin to plan
-	Arrange for local entertainment or tour for one evening
or afternoon
-	At least 1 month before the meeting provide weather and
other special arrangement information to email list
2.	Arrange for copying/duplication services to be available
during the meeting (~2 months before the meeting)
-	Arrange for computer and printer for members to use
during the meeting (~2 months before the meeting)
-	See more about copying under "Useful Hints" below
3.	Arrange for food during the meeting:
-	Morning Continental Breakfast
-	Morning Break
-	Afternoon Break
(About 6 - 12 months before the meeting, depending on
local demand for hotels.  Be sure to negotiate all
prices ahead of time.)
4.	Activities required during the meeting
-	Work with Treasurer for bill payment arrangements
-	Help with computer access, requirements
-	Supervise copying of documents
-	Provide liaison with hotel during meeting week
II.	Useful Hints
A.	What To Do If Hotel Insists On Prepayment - Suggestions:
-	host company provides prepayment
-	get another hotel
-	see if X3J3 Treasurer can cover temporarily
B.	Criteria for Hotel Selection
-	comfortable
-	easily accessible from major airport
-	usually there is no cost for the meeting room
-	reasonably priced for area of meeting
-	availability of group discount rates
-	availability of corporate discount rates
-	usual price for hotel rooms is around $60 - $90
-	hotel within walking distance of restaurants and possibly
shopping districts
C.	Number Of Hotel Rooms Required In The Past Have Been:
	Terre Haute (121): 33
	Bellevue    (122): 27
	New Haven   (123): 27
These numbers might be useful in estimating the size of the
meeting room needed.
D.	Negotiations With A Hotel
-	Be careful to understand what all hidden costs will be.
(One time there was a $1.50 charge per tea bag since it was
not included in the original contract with the hotel.)
-	Make sure all options are explored.  Each hotel has
different packages and options.  For example, the meeting
room might be free if there is $70 a person of food arranged
for at the meetings; the meeting room might be free if the
hotel caters at least one meal; or the meeting room is free
if more than 10 rooms are booked, etc.
-	Make sure what the hotel's deadline is to free up unreserved
rooms in the block of rooms; make sure members know of this
deadline
-	Make sure what the hotel's policy is on charging for rooms
reserved in the block; we do not want to pay for unused
rooms
-	Possibly arrange with hotel transportation to and from the
airport for those members not renting a car
-	Contact hotels as early as possible in order to make the
best possible arrangements in terms of price and hotel.  The
best hotels are booked the earliest.
-	Try to inspect facilities yourself on the first day of the
meeting rather than rely on hotel staff.  You know what the
committee is used to for accommodations.
E.	More On The Hotel Arrangements:
-	The meeting room is nicer if it has windows
-	Room should be reasonably free of outside noise such as from
the kitchen or street
-	It is nice if the room is available on a 24 hour basis
-	It is nice if the room has easy access to the outside for
breaks
-	Table space is very important and we often do not have
enough room on the table for all of our working documents
-	Having drapes on the tables is nice.  Hotels often do this
but you might remind them
F.	It is better if you can visit the hotels before negotiating
the contract in order to evaluate for yourself the suitability
of the accommodations
G.	Costs for meetings are covered by the meeting fees collected
at the meeting from the membership.  Sometimes people are
excused from paying this fee due to hardship or lack of
funding, so meeting costs should be calculated on the basis of
a conservative estimate of attendance.  Currently there are
approximately 27 people attending who are paying.  X3J3 voted
to increase the meeting fee to $100 at meeting 122 (Bellevue,
1992) but we hope not to use all of that for some meetings at
least.
-	Costs include:
	. food
	. meeting room
	. FIDS room
	. break-out rooms
	. copying
	. miscellaneous (do not know what this is but something
might come up)
H.	On Copying Services:
-	Factors to consider in providing copy services:  cost and
timely turn-around.  The number of documents produced at a
meeting vary from 60 - 200 with 20 - 30 copies per document.
Often the committee needs to be able to have copies returned
in just a couple of hours.  Three copy runs a day can be
needed.
-	Having efficient and inexpensive copying is very important
to the success of the meeting.
-	Copy services that have been successful in the past are:
.	have someone available to do copy runs to business or
local copying shop
.	use of local copying business at prearranged prices
hired out
.	rental of copy machine by host for the week with enough
paper available for members to do their own copying as
needed
.	The hotel's copying service is usually quite expensive
and is not a good option, but check about this with the
hotel.
-	Copy runs are normally made first thing in the morning;
shortly after lunch; and one before dinner so papers can be
read overnight.  Check with committee each day on their
requirements.
III.	Optional Tasks
A.	Provide weather information for that time of year; it helps to
know what to wear and bring
B.	Provide Restaurant Lists And Potential Entertainment
Opportunities
-	include average price and directions and type of restaurant.
(Local Chambers of Commerce often have this information
available)
-	in the past we have had interesting site/plant tours of a
host's facility, for example of SLAC.  We have also had
hikes in Estes Park and at Lake Tahoe as well.  We have had
lovely dinners at hosts homes.
C.	Suggestions For Continental Breakfasts:
-	Fruit and fruit juice
-	Coffee and hot water (with tea bags)
-	Miscellaneous baked goods -	muffins, pastries, etc.
D.	Suggestions To Include With Snacks:
-	Fruit, muffins, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, etc.
-	Coffee, tea, hot water, fruit juice in morning
-	Coffee, tea, hot water, soda in afternoon
E.	Make sure to check meeting schedule to see if snacks will be
needed on last day of meeting
F.	Drinking water should be on table throughout meeting
G.	Have someone from the hotel or meeting place readily available
if there are meeting needs that need to be met quickly.
(Situations that have needed attention in the past have been a
leaky roof, an overheated meeting room, and a malfunctioning
projector.)
I.	Some people might stay over another night at the hotel or
arrive a day or so earlier.  Make sure that some rooms are
available (about 1/4) and that the reduced rate applies to the
extra days if possible.  Check with membership that the
arrangements meet their expectations.
IV.	Miscellaneous Materials Useful To Have Available
A.	Pencils, pens, markers, erasers
B.	Tape; scotch and masking
C.	Hole punch (preferably two punches)
D.	Stapler and stapler remover
E.	Paper; plain and lined
F.	Waste basket (large!)
G.	Blank transparencies and markers
H.	White-out
I.	Power strips and extension cords for members' computers in
meeting room
