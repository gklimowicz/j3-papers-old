Subject: What to do re IEEE 754?
Date: 2013 January 21

We have been thinking about how to respond to IEEE 754 (2008)
for some time without making a definite plan, let alone
exercising one.

We should respond with update in f1x to make it compatible
with the 2008 revision, or clearly understand why we are not
doing so.

The US position at 201 should reflect a decision made,
not a decision avoided.
