Discussion:

WG5 requested that subgroup consider removing some of the collectives.
After considering all of the collectives we concluded that CO_FINDLOC
is the only collective intrinsic that should be removed.

Edits:

[357] Delete the entry for CO_FINDLOC from Table 13.1.

[378:3-35] Delete subclause 13.7.36.
