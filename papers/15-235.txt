1. Introduction
===============

If one extends a type that has a generic interface, and the binding
names in that interface are not disclosed, one does not know what
restrictions on generic declarations might be violated by declaring the
same generic interface in an extension type.

To reduce this problem, it would be helpful if

(1) a generic interface could include the same specific procedure, using
    the same local identifier, more than once, and

(2) for a type-bound generic interface, passed-object dummy arguments of
    a procedure and one that overrides it are distinguishable even
    though they are TKR compatible.

Is this so much of a project that it would be considered a work item,
and therefore falls outside the scope of the London resolutions, as
specified in N2082?

2. Edits
========

[291:5 12.4.3.5.5p1] After "procedures" insert "that are not the same
procedure with either the same local identifier or the same binding
name, and".

[291:12+ 12.4.3.5.5p3] Insert a list item

" o  one is the passed-object dummy argument of a type-bound procedure
     in a type-bound generic interface and the other is the
     passed-object dummy argument of a type-bound procedure that
     overrides the first one,
"
