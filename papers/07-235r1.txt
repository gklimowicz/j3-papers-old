    The J3 meeting (#180) was called to order at 8:00 AM, Monday,
    May 7, 2007, at the Emerald Suites, Las Vegas, NV, USA,
    by the J3 chair, Dan Nagle.

1.1 Opening business                             D. Nagle

    The Chairman welcomed everyone.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair                     D. Nagle

    Dan welcomed Jim Xia, the new principal representation from
    IBM, replacing Rob James.

    Dan reapplied for the J3 chairmanship;  since there were no
    other volunteers, Dan will likely be chair again.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda                         D. Nagle

**  motion: Adopt the agenda as amended (moved by Dick Hendrickson/
            seconded by Michael Ingrassia): passed by unanimous consent
            {uc}

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 179 minutes            D. Nagle

1.1.4 INCITS/SDB report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    The J3 annual report is due before meeting 181.  Van Snyder will
    present it to INCITS at their West Coast meeting.

1.1.5 OWG-V report (if any)                      D. Nagle

    The Other Working Group-V met in Padua.  They discussed software
    vulnerability.  They have representatives from C, C#, Ada, and
    Fortran;  C++ is not represented.

    There is a "specials functions" subgroup that will need Fortran
    bindings - Van Snyder expressed interest in reviewing this work.

    There may be a new C standard to add safety and reliability
    features.

1.1.6 ISO/WG5 report                             Van Snyder, IR

    There will be a USTAG meeting this week.

    The next WG5 meeting is a joint meeting with J3 in London in
    August, 2007.

1.1.7 J11 Liaison report (if any)                C. Rasmussen

    Craig Rasmussen not present.

    Dan Nagle mentioned that maybe the Interoperability TR {TRs are
    now called TSs} should specify C functions like the C standard
    does.

1.1.8 H2 Liaison report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    Nothing new to report.

1.1.9 IEEE 754 report (if any)                   M. Ingrassia

    The draft 1.4.0 ballot has ended;  there are many technical
    issues to resolve.

1.1.10 Treasurer's report                         V. Snyder

    The new J3 bank account is still named the "J3 COBOL" committee.
    Van is holding Lynn Barra's $102 seed money until this is
    resolved.

    $3092.07 is current balance.  There is a reimbursement to Rich
    Bleikamp for web site work still pending.

    The meeting 180 fee is $50.00 .

1.1.11 Beginning membership report                S. Whitlock

    M. van Waveren                        T. Moene
    S. Whitlock

    Rich Bleikamp is not present.  If he does not attend this meeting,
    HP's membership will be in jeopardy of losing membership because
    of missing 2 of the last 3 meetings.

    Jim Xia replaced Rob James as IBM's principal representative.  IBM
    was in jeopardy of losing membership because of missing 2 of the
    last 3 meetings.  After attending this meeting, IBM will still be
    in jeopardy of losing membership because of missing 2 of the last
    3 meetings;  IBM will have to attend J3 meeting #181 in order to
    not lose membership.

    Matthijs van Waveren was in jeopardy of losing membership because
    of missing 2 of the last 3 meetings.  He was represented last
    meeting and is attending this meeting so his membership is no longer
    in jeopardy at the end of this meeting.

    No one is in jeopardy of losing membership because of missing 2 of
    the last 3 letter ballots.

    requested.

    Aug-2007;  Stan Whitlock will host J3 meeting #182 in Nov-2007.

1.1.13 Comments from members
