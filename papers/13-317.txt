Subject: delete obsolete DO forms UK-10.1b
Date: 2013 September 10

Obsolete forms of the DO loop are hard to understand, especially
for modern programmers, and are error prone.  They are redundant
with block loops.  UK Item 10 subitem 1b, accepted at Delft,
advocates deleting these forms.

Specification:  The non block forms of the do loop are deleted.
The shared termination forms of the do loop are deleted.

Syntax: The non block forms are no longer valid syntax.
Shared termination of do loops is no longer valid syntax.

Edits:

{remove obsolete terms from branch target statement definition}

[4:38] delete "<do-term-action-stmt>, <do-term-shared-stmt>,"

{remove alternative definitions}

[174:12] change the line to "The DO construct is written
in a block form."

{remove the syntax term}

[174:14] delete the line

{add a constraint prohibiting shared continues}

[175:5+] add "C815+ (R814) No two <do-stmt> in the same scope
shall have the same <label>."

{the main event}

[175:6-32] delete the lot

[175:37-42] delete the paragraph

{remove non-block discuss from the execution cycle discussion}

[176:28-31] delete the small-font sentences, that is, delete
"If, as a result, ... was most recently executed."

[177:12-13] delete the final sentence of the paragraph:
"If this ... is not executed."

[177:17-19] delete the final two sentences of the paragraph:
"In a non block ... is then executed."

{add to deleted list}

{note interaction with edits proposed in 13-316}

[463++] add "(8) Nonblock DO loops
The non block forms of the do loop were confusing and hard

targets was especially difficult for modern programmers to fathom.
