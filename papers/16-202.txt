Subject:    Events that cause undefinition of deferred type parameters
References: 16-007r1

Subclause 16.6.6 might not be the correct place to describe events that
cause deferred type parameters to become undefined, but I can't think of
a better place.  Are they already described somewhere else?  Do we need
a new subclause?

[521:5 16.6.6p1(10)] Append "and all deferred type parameters of its
declared type become undefined".

[521:7 16.6.6p1(11)] Append "and all deferred type parameters of its
declared type become undefined".

[521:7+ 16.6.6p1(11+)] Insert a list item:

" (11a) When pointer becomes disassociated or its pointer association
        status becomes undefined, all deferred type parameters of its
        declared type become undefined".
