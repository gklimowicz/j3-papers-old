Subject:   Wart removal proposal -- pointer arguments to SAME_TYPE_AS
From:      Van Snyder
Date: 2014 December 29
Reference: 15-007

1. Introduction
===============

The dynamic type of a nonpolymorphic pointer is always well defined.
Therefore the requirement that a pointer argument to SAME_TYPE_AS shall
not have undefined association status is not necessary for
nonpolymorphic arguments.

2. Proposal
===========

Allow a nonpolymorphic argument to SAME_TYPE_AS to have undefined
pointer association status.

3. Edits
========

[Introduction, under "Intrinsic Functions"] Insert list item

"-- Nonpolymorphic pointer arguments to SAME_TYPE_AS are not required to
    have defined pointer association status."

[391:32,34 13.7.147p3] Insert "polymorphic" before "pointer".
