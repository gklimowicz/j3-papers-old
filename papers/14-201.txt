Subject: undeprecating FORALL ?
Date: 2014 June 23

In the course of discussing 14-128r1, the subject of FORALL arose.

Straw Vote for WG5:
The FORALL statement and block should be undeprecated.  Y-N-U

Rationale:
Discussion on comp.lang.fortran and the Intel forum showed some support
for FORALL.  Therefore, it should not be deprecated at this time.

It is fine to move the <forall-header> and friends
to <concurrent-header> and all.

This serves to emphasize DO CONCURRENT.

Edits:

{undo the small font}

[166:1-168:2] reset font to regular size

{remove from the deprecated list}

[486:27] delete the FORALL item

{remove the explanation}

[488:21-26] delete the FORALL heading and paragraph
