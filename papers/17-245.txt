1. Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[353:6] General (under Specifications of the Standard Intrinsic
        Procedures) 16.09.1 Para 2
The third sentence of the paragraph, "The result characteristics are
sometimes specified in terms of the characteristics of dummy
arguments." is not helpful because the detailed specifications are
for the actual arguments, see the second sentence.


2. Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intrinsic procedures act as if they have explicit interfaces.
In the cases where the results depend on the arguments, a specific
function is selected using ordinary generic resolution, and the
actual arguments' characteristics and dummy arguments'
characteristics match.

We believe the sentence is useful to predict the result value's
characteristics.
