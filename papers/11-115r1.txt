DISCUSSION

Unresolved Technical Issue TR5 of N1838 asks for Constraint C516 to
be removed.

EDIT to N1838:

[4:9] "of subclause" -> "in subclause".

[4:13+] At the end of subclause 2.3 OPTIONAL attribute, add
  "Constraint C516 in subclause 5.3.1 of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 says
   'The ALLOCATABLE, POINTER, or OPTIONAL attribute shall not be specified
   for a dummy argument of a procedure that has a
   <proc-language-binding-spec>.' This is deleted since it is no longer
   applicable.".
