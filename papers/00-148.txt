1. Introduction

Issue 17 says
  "...
   I'm bothered by having a component name that isn't the name of a component.
   Perhaps we should use different terminology such as subobject name ..."

I concur.

Issue 18 says
  "Should the above not be a constraint?  Fix up grandparents."

The answer to the question is No, but it ought to be part of our scoping rules
(which do have similar status as constraints in requiring violation to be
diagnosed).

I concur with the second commandment.

Issue 19 says
  "but the name ... is not a component ...."

ok, ok already!

Issue 211 says
  "\"flattened form\" is used ... but ... nowhere defined"

I concur.

2. Edits to 00-007

[53:20-22] Replace with
           "An extended type has a <<parent subobject>> with the type and type
            parameters of the parent type, consisting of all of the components
            inherited from the parent type.  The name of the parent subobject
            is the parent type name."
{Define a term for the parent subobject.}

[53:23-32] Delete J3 note 17.
{We no longer call the name of the parent subobject a "component name".}

[53:33] Replace "subobject denoted by the parent type name" with
        "parent subobject name".
{Improve readability by using our new term.}

[53:35+] Insert new paragraph
  "The <<subobject names>> of a nonextensible type or of a base type are the
   names of its components.  The subobject names of an extended type are the
   name of its parent subobject, the subobject names of its parent type, and
   the names of its additional components."
{Define new term "subobject name" we can use instead of component name when we
 want to include the parent subobject designator(s).  Note that it is defined
 recursively so that "grandparent" names are included.}

[53:36-38] Replace "have neither" with "not have",
           Replace "accessible component" with "accessible subobject name",
           Delete "nor ... type",
	   Make the whole thing a note.
{Use our new terminology; make it a note because it will be covered by the
 scoping rules in ch14.}

[53:39-41] Delete J3 note 18.

[56:7] Replace "component that has the same name as the parent type" with
       "parent subobject".
{Use our new term to improve readability and correctness.}

[56:8] Add to end of paragraph
       "In the <<flattened form>>, a value is provided for each component of
        the extended type."
{Add a definition of "flattened form".}

[56:9-12] Delete J3 note 19.
{We don't call the parent subobject a component any more.}

[56:13-17] Delete J3 note 211.
{We now have a definition of "flattened form".}

[96:37] Replace "name of a component" with "subobject name".
{Make parent subobjects usable.}

[342:18] Replace "components, and binding names" with
         "bindings, and named subobjects".
{Move scoping requirement from ch4 to ch14.}
