Subject: Clause 1 edits to N2040

Discussion
----------

In their recent ballots (see N2045) Malcolm Cohen and Reinhold Bader
pointed out that the examples illustrating the semantics described in
clauses 6 and 7 are not there. An edit corrects this.

Edit to N2040:
---------------

[1:7] Replace "that the examples ... conforming" with "the correct
execution of the examples in Annex A that illustrate the semantics
described in clauses 6 and 7".
