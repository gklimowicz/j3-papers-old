+++ Issue #1 +++

In 11.2.1 at [279:21-22] a sentence reads
"A nonintrinsic module is defined by a module program unit
or by a means other than Fortran."

What "means other than Fortran" is that?

When used to describe program units (see, for instance, 11.1 at
[279:14-15]) these words indicate that something describable
by C is intended.

15.1 tell us that procedures may interoperate,
and that global data may interoperate.  No mention of modules.

A similarly cryptic phrase is in 12.2.2.2 at [285:21]; but
15.3.7 [467:1+] tells us how to make the interface.

Furthermore, 15.3.1 [463:3-5] tell us that "If a Fortran
entity is interoperable, an equivalent entity could be defined
by means of C and the Fortran entity would interoperate
with the C entity."

What entity in C could interoperate with a module?  That is,
in C, how would I declare a name that could be used as a module name
on a use statement?

I can find no description of such a C entity in 1539.
I can't think of what might be in 9899 the would fit the bill.
So the standard provides no interpretation for such an attempted
program.  So it must be non standard.  So the phrase
"or by a means other than Fortran" at [279:22] is, at best,
unsupported and may well be unsupportable.

I can find no similar claim for submodules in 11.2.3 [283:1+].

Edit at [279:21-22] delete "or by means other than Fortran"
