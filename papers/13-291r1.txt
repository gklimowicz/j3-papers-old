Subject: FORM SUBTEAM and image index

Discussion: 
~~~~~~~~~~~

It is desired to assign specific index numbers to images of a subteam.
For example, it allows users replacing a failed image in the current
team with a spare image and assign the same image index number as the
failed image to it.

[10:18] Replacing R505 with the following:

"R505 <form-subteam-stmt> is FORM SUBTEAM (<subteam-id>,
<team-variable> [,<form-subteam-spec-list])

[10:19] Change "scalar-integer-expr" to "scalar-int-expr".

[10:19+] Insert the following after line 19

"R507 <form-subteam-spec>          is NEW_INDEX=<scalar-int-expr>
                                   or <sync-stat>

 C504 (R505) No specifier shall appear more than once in a given
      <form-subteam-spec-list>."

[10:22+] After line 22, insert new paragraph:

"The value of the <scalar-int-expr> in a NEW_INDEX= specifier specifies the
 image index that the executing image will have in the subteam specified by
 <subteam-id>.  It shall be greater than zero and less than or equal to the
 number of images in the subteam.  Images with the same value for
 <subteam-id> shall have a different value for the NEW_INDEX= specifier."
