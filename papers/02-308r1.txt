Subject:  Specifying "private" in an extends clause

Introduction
------------
If a parent component is specified as private in an extends
clause, what is the effect?  This is never explained in the
normative text of the Committee Draft.

Given the example in C.1.3, it appears that the parent component
and all components inheritance associated with it are private in
the resulting type.  This is never said anywhere in the normative
text.

Even if this is fixed, there is the problem of type bound
procedures.  Are these all private in the resulting type unless
they are overridden and declared to be public?  If this is the
case, and if a type bound procedure that was declared as public in
the parent type is not overridden and declared to be public in the
child type, then this makes the type bound procedure private in
the child type, which is exactly what page 55, line 18 was trying
to prevent ("If the inherited binding is PUBLIC then the
overriding binding shall not be PRIVATE.").

In light of the fact that this feature is very poorly explained,
maybe it would be best to remove it from this revision of Fortran.
