Reference: SC22 resolution 05-06

J3 wishes to express its support for SC22 resolution 05-06:

JTC 1/SC 22 notes that its project editors have been having substantial
problems with the publication process. For example, in a number of recent
publications, internal bookmarks were removed, rendering the documents
difficult to navigate.

JTC 1/SC 22 instructs its Secretariat to request the ITTF to allow the
following mode of processing to be applied at the request of the project
editor before publication of a JTC 1/SC 22 standard, TR, or corrigendum.

1. The project editor sends the approved format file (currently PDF)
   together with any additional source files necessary for ITTF to note and
   verify changes.
2. The ITTF lists the changes it requires.
3. The project editor constructs a new approved format and source files
   and sends them.
4. Steps 2. and 3. are repeated until no changes are needed.

The purpose of this procedure is to improve the quality of the final document.  

J3 takes note of the following changes between the committee draft 
and the final published International Standard:  the PDF table of contents 
was removed and all internal hyperlinks from references to numbered
sections were removed.  J3 considers these changes to be unfortunate 
and to reduce the value and ease of use of the final International Standard.
