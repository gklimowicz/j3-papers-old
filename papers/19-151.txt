NUMBER: F18/010
TITLE: Categories of pure procedures
KEYWORDS: pure
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTIONS:

Subclause 15.7 Pure procedures begins with a list of categories
of pure procedures.  The list does not include procedure pointers
or type-bound procedures.  Dummy procedures are included in the
list, and so dummy procedure pointers are allowed, but other
procedure pointers are not.

Q1. Can procedure pointers that are not dummy procedures be pure?

Q2: Can type-bound procedures be pure?


ANSWERS:

A1.  Procedure pointers that are not dummy procedures are allowed
     to be pure.  The absence of procedure pointers in the list in
     Subclause 15.7 is an oversight.  A edit to correct the
     oversight is provided.

A2.  Type-bound procedures that are bound to pure procedures are
     pure.  The absence of type-bound procedures in Subclause 15.7
     is an oversight.  An edit to correct the oversight is provided.
