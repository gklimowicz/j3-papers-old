Subject:    Address ALLOCATED and ASSOCIATED explicitly in 7.1.11

References: 10-007r1, Interpretation F08/0095

1. The Problem
--------------

Interpretation F08/0095 addressed the problems associated with the
PRESENT intrinsic function in specification and constant expressions.

Whether an allocatable variable is allocated, and whether a pointer is
associated, are not explicitly stated to be deferred properties.  The
terms "deferred shape" and "deferred length" are used.  A reader who
does not realize that deferred shape and length get their values only by
allocation or association might be tempted to believe that "deferred"
applies only to shape and length.  It would therefore be helpful to add
ALLOCATED and ASSOCIATED explicitly to the discussion in 7.1.11.

2. Edits to 10-007r1
--------------------

[7.1.11p2 150:27+] Change the edit in F08/0095 that inserts item (9b) to
  "(9b) a reference to the intrinsic function ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED, or
        PRESENT,"
{Explicitly allow ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED, and PRESENT to be used.}

[7.1.11p4 150:37] Change the edit for item (1) to:
  after "inquiry intrinsic function" insert "other than ALLOCATED,
  ASSOCIATED, or PRESENT".
{Remove ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED, and PRESENT from the list of
 specification inquiries, thereby explicitly forbidding them in constant
 expressions.}
