Here are drafts for the ANSWER and EDITS sections of 003. Also, I
propose that the addendum be removed.

ANSWER:
Intrinsic concatenation is defined only for character operands with the
same kind type parameter value. This is stated clearly (90: 8-9): 'For the
character intrinsic operator //, the kind type parameters shall be the
same'.

There is a need for a similar restriction at this point for relational
intrinsic operators with character operands. The words at the end of
the next paragraph (90: 12) actually suggest that there are relational
intrinsic operations for character operands of different kind type
parameter values that are not character relational intrinsic
operations.

The word 'requiring' in the last sentence in the note in Table 7.1
should be changed since all the intrinsic operators with character
operands require their operands to have the same kind type parameter
value.

EDITS:

Page 89, Table 7.1, penultimate line (89:38). Change 'requiring' to
'with'.

Page 90, line 9. Add 'For the relational intrinsic operators with
character operands, the kind type parameters shall be the same'.

Page 90, line 12. Delete 'and have the same kind type parameter value'.
