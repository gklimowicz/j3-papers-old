PROPOSAL B  Add an optional lower bound specifier to the left side of
the pointer assignment statement and change the way lower bounds are
determined if not specified in this way.

Text changes

Page 110, line 39, change to

R736 pointer-assignment-stmt is
     pointer-object [ (bounds-spec-list) ] => target

R736a	bounds-spec            is  [ lower-bound ] :

Page 110, after line 42, add

  Constraint:  The number of <bounds-spec>s specified shall be equal to
               the rank of <pointer-object>.

Page 111, after line 22, add to NOTE 7.46

     WINDOW2(0:, 0:) => MAT2D (ML:MU, NL:NU)


Page 55, lines 41 through 45, change to

(2)  They are specified in a pointer assignment statement.  If a
     <bounds-spec-list> is present, it specifies the lower bound for each
     dimension.  The extent of a dimension of a pointer is the extent of
     the corresponding dimension of the target.  If the lower bound is d
     and the extent of the corresponding dimension of the target is s,
     the value of the upper bound is s + d - 1.  If the lower bounds are
     not specified, the lower bound of each dimension is 1.


Page 3, after line 8, in a section titled Fortran 95 compatibility fol-
lowing the leading sentence: "The following Fortran 95 features have
different interpretations in this International Standard:"

(1)  If a lower bound specification list is not provided in a pointer
     assignment statement and the target is a whole array or array
     structure	component, the default determination of the bounds of the
     pointer is changed by this standard.
