Different amounts of data may be needed in the team values of a team
and the amount will certainly depend on the team size. It is likely
that implementations will hold the data in an allocatable component
or its equivalent. This means that if the team variable is a coarray,
assignment to a remote image is not available. Assignment from a
remote image is not useful because the value must be used on the
image on which it was created. We therefore propose to disallow
coarrays of type TEAM_TYPE.
