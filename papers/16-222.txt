Discussion:
-----------

Paper 16-190 points out that attributes of associate names are not
consistent.  Some of the reason is that an edit from 15-240r4 was
improperly applied.

Whether the associating entity in two of the three cases of the SELECT
RANK construct has the TARGET attribute was simply overlooked.

Edits to J3/16-007r1:
---------------------

[175:5-6 8.1.3.3p1] Move "The associating entity ... ASYNCHRONOUS or
VOLATILE ... has the attribute." to be after "selector." at [175:11
8.1.3.3P2], where 15-240r4 said it should have been.  This results in
the associating entity having those attributes in the SELECT RANK cases
not covered by the first sentence of 8.1.10.3p1.

[192:24-25 8.1.10.3p2]  Replace the first two sentences with "The
associating entity has the ALLOCATABLE, POINTER, or TARGET attribute if
the selector has that attribute."  The TARGET attribute had been
overlooked for the two SELECT RANK cases not covered by the first
sentence of 8.1.10.3p1.
