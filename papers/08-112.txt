Subject: UTI 135 (p447): Internal contradiction about IEEE arithmetic
Date: 2008 January 22
References: J3/08-007, ISO/IEC TR 15580, J3/07-332r1


1. Discussion

The editor points out a contradiction between the first and second
paragraphs of 14.9. The sentence in TR 15580 that corresponds to the
second paragraph of 14.9 is
  "For each of the other arithmetic operators and for each implemented
  IEEE rounding mode, the result shall be as specified in the IEEE
  standard whenever the operands and IEEE result are normalized."
Here, "other" means other than divide.

Here, we address the contradiction by correcting the first paragraph and
deleting the second.



2. Edits to 08-007

[446:16] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, just before the bulleted list, insert
"if the result of IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is true for a particular kind
of real"

[446:19] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, bullet 2, after "conform" add
"whenever the operands and IEEE result are normal".

[446:20-21] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, bullet 3. Delete this item.

[446:26] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, after the bulleted list, do not start
a new pararaph here.

[446:27-29] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, delete paragraph 3.
