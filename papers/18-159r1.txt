Subject: C_LOC needs to permit an  assumed-type argument
Date: 2018-June-12


Discussion:
-----------

The description of the X argument of C_LOC in 18.2.3.6 includes the
sentence:

"It shall either be a variable with interoperable type and kind type
parameters, or be a nonpolymorphic variable with no length type
parameters."

This effectively prohibits assumed-type arguments for C_LOC as
assumed-type objects are unlimited polymorphic.  However, it is clear
from C710 in 7.3.2.2 TYPE type specifier:

"C710 An assumed-type variable name shall not appear in a designator
      or expression except as an actual argument corresponding to a
      dummy argument that is assumed-type, or as the first argument to
      the intrinsic function IS_CONTIGUOUS, LBOUND, PRESENT, RANK,
      SHAPE, SIZE, or UBOUND, or the function C_LOC from the intrinsic
      module ISO_C_BINDING."

that it was intended to allow assumed-type arguments for C_LOC.  It
was an oversight to not have repaired the description of C_LOC when
assumed-type was added in F2018.

An edit is provided to fix this oversight.


Edit to WG5/N2146:
------------------

[484] In 18.2.3.6 C_LOC (X), paragraph 3 Argument, third sentence, 

Delete "either".
After "kind type parameters", insert "an assumed-type variable,".
Before "a nonpolymorphic" delete "be".
After "nonpolymorphic variable" change "with" to "that has"
(make harder to misparse).

{The edit changes the sentence from 

"It shall either be a variable with interoperable type and kind type
parameters, or be a nonpolymorphic variable with no length type
parameters."

to


"It shall be a variable with interoperable type and kind type
parameters, an assumed-type variable, or a nonpolymorphic
variable that has no length type parameters."}
