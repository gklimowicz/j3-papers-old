1. Discussion

Note 11.4 at Page 187 seems need some repair.
In the code of Note 11.4, the first appearance of 'Z' is in the
block scoping unit, and the comment says

  "!Implicitly declared in S, thus saved."

It seems suggest that the implicit declaration
of 'Z' is actually in the inclusive scope as 8.7p4 states.

It will become confusing in the wake of fixing the scope of
an implicit declared variable should include the block scoping unit
rather than its inclusive scope (paper 17-184).

In order to make the comment quoted at the above true, the following
edit is suggested.

2. Edits

[187] Note 11.4
Add "Z = 1" in the scoping unit of subroutine "S".
