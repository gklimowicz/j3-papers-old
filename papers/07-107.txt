Zero-size arrays and zero-length strings are fairly obvious concepts.
Zero-size derived-type objects are less obvious.

8.2.3a Zero-size data objects.

An array that has zero elements is a zero-size array.

A character string that has zero length is a zero-length character string.

A derived-type object that has no components, or in which all components
are zero-size objects, is a zero-size derived-type object.  Components can
have zero size by being declared to have zero size, or by depending upon
type parameter values in such a way that they have zero size.

A zero-size storage sequence consists of zero objects, or of objects all
of which have zero size.

size derived-type objects".

  (19a) Allocation of a zero-length character string causes the string
        to become defined.
  (29b) Allocation of a zero-size derived-type variable causes the object
        to become defined.
