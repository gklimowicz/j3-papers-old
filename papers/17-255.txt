             Minutes J3 Meeting 214
             ===============================

1. Monday, October 16, 2017  8:00 am
-------------------------------------
1.1 Opening business                              D. Nagle
       Remarks from the chair                     D. Nagle
          Dan thanked us all for our attendance this meeting,
          and reiterated that our goal for m214 is to march 2015
          to being an international standard
       Adoption of agenda                         D. Nagle
         Snyder/Klimowicz
       Approval of Meeting 213 minutes            D. Nagle

         Long/Snyder
       INCITS report (if any)                     D. Nagle
        INCITS is enforcing more rules, so we need to look
        at our processes and procedures.
       WG23 report (if any)                       D. Nagle
        The WG23 group took our laTex document, converted to a
         MS Word doc, and other members can edit/help.
         Gary volunteered to help.
       J11 Liaison report (if any)                D. Nagle
        Only a few emails about CPlex in the last weeks.
         Seems to be going thru last integrations
       MPI Liaison report (if any)                B. Long
         Recent topics include "Sessions" and continued work on Fault
          Tolerance.
         Sessions are basically semi-independent codes that are written
          as if stand-alone. Each calls MPI_init which already creates
          a problem. Would not send/receive between sessions. Sessions
          could have different Fault Tolerant models.
         The Fault Tolerant group is discussing "catastrophic" and
          "non-catastrophic" errors. Debate about whether recovery should
           be specified, or just notification.
         MPI seems to have an image problem of being stagnant and not
           progessing to Exascale. Solution: More Forum meetings.
       OpenMP Liaison report (if any)             B. Long
          TR6 to be release for SC17 next month. Preview for
          OpenMP 5.0 to be released ~SC18.  Features include:

          1) Memory allocators to choose a kind of memory (HBM, ...)
          2) OMPD debugger interface.
          3) Declare mapper directive to provide "deep copy" support,
             including for pointer components.
          4) Concurrent directive permitting flexible parallism.
             OpenMP committee discussing a CONCURRENT directive.  Some
             members do not agree with that keyword because "concurrent"
             has some specific meaning in Computer Science that is
             different.
          5) APIs for displaying thread affinity informaion.
          6) New clauses for declare target directive to allow
             specification of different functions depending on the
             target device.
          7) Better declarations for task dependencies.
          8) Nontemporal SIMD clause to give compilers hints
             about cache choices.

       UPC Liaison report (if any)                B. Friesen
         Nothing interesting since last meeting.

   Discussion: 17-193 "Informal name of the revised language" [Muxworthy]
        One argument; its out there in publications from Reid, Chivers
                (a quick internet search showed lots of references)
                internally developers use 2015
        Other side:  Incompatible with other languages (such as C++)
                It's coming out 3 years later than the name
                Makes it look like the standard is stagnant
        Straw vote:
           1) Keep 2015
           2) Change to 2018
           3) Undecided
        1: 4   2: 5  3: 3     So little guidance.
        Will go to a WG5 vote; J3 has no particular direction.
        Steve will post the updated paper.

5.7 Comments from members

    Steve noted that there was a message from INCITS relative to the
limitations on number and timing of Technical Corrigenda.  The proposal
is that each Standing Committee will be given write access to its own
subsection of an official web site.  The purpose is to provide the SC
with a forum for disseminating information.  This is still in the
planning stage, and more information once it's established.

    Discussed the WG5 survey,  It is open until January, and will be
looked at (time allowing) at the Feb meeting.

Adjournment  5:20 PM
