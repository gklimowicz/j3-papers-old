This paper is a response to comments GB07, GB08 and GB09 for the
F2015 CD Ballot (WG5 N2125)

GB07
----

In reference to 8.5.3, "Only variables and components can have the
ALLOCATABLE attribute, but people get confused over ALLOCATABLE
function results. The function result variable is ALLOCATABLE,
but the function return value is just a value (it's not a variable)."

J3 agrees that this is a frequent topic of confusion. A note is
supplied in the edits below to address this.

GB08
----

"In 8.8 IMPORT statement, the BNF and paragraphs 1-3 use the term
'IMPORT statement' to refer to any of the four forms, but paragraph 4
uses it to refer to the first form."

J3 agrees that this is a defect - an edit has been supplied.

GB09
----

In reference to 8.10.2.4: "This para says 'A nonpointer object
of a derived type that is not a numeric sequence or character sequence
type shall be associated only with nonpointer objects of the same type
with the same type parameter values.' Noting that if a common block
object is of a derived type, the type is required to have the BIND
attribute or the SEQUENCE attribute (C8118) and that BIND and SEQUENCE
types are not permitted to have type parameters, the words 'with the
same type parameter values' are vacuous and should be deleted."

J3 agrees - an edit has been supplied.

Edits

100:1+, 8.5.3p1+ (ALLOCATABLE attribute)

After p1, insert the note:

"NOTE 8.3a
Only variables and components can have the ALLOCATABLE attribute.
The result of referencing a function whose result variable has the
ALLOCATABLE attribute is a value that does not itself have the
ALLOCATABLE attribute."

123:26, 8.8p4 (IMPORT statememt)

After "IMPORT statement with" insert "no specifier and", so that the
sentence begins: "If an IMPORT statement with no specifier and no
import-name-list appears..."

128:24, 8.10.2.4p4 (Common association)

Delete "with the same type parameter values"
