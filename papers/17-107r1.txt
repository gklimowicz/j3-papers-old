Subject: STAT= wording clarification for ALLOCATE

Discussion
----------

The first sentence of 9.7.4, para 3, begins "If an ALLOCATE or
DEALLOCATE statement with a coarray <allocate-object> is executed when
one or more images of the current team has initiated normal
termination of execution, the <stat-variable> becomes defined..."
This is only the case if a STAT= specifier appears. What happens if
one does not appear is a bit far away in 9.7.3.1p3.  It would be
clearer here to give <stat-variable> context by saying that a STAT=
appears.

--------------


[147:1] In 9.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, sentence 1, after "If an
ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement with" add "a STAT= specifier and".
