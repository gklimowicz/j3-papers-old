Subject:   Allow mixed-kind in SIGN functions

1. Introduction
===============

In the SIGN function, the only interesting part of the value of the
second argument is its sign.  It therefore doesn't seem necessary that
the arguments are required to have the same kind.

2. Proposal
===========

The arguments of SIGN are not required to have the same kind.

3. Draft Edits
==============

[Introduction, under "Intrinsic Functions"] Insert list item

"-- The B argument to the SIGN function is not required to have the
    same kind type parameter as the A argument.
"

{remove the offending restriction}

[396:15 13.7.158p3] Remove "and kind type parameter".
