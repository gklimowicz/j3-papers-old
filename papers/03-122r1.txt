Subject: Edits for UK comment TC2 (Respecification at type extension)
Date: 31 March 2003
Author: Lawrie Schonfelder

Comment TC2 of the UK vote was:

  Remove the option of re-specifying the accessibility and default
  initial value for the parent component when a type is extended.

  This complicates the language with little benefit.

Here are the edits for this w.r.t. 03-166:

42:2-3. Replace by 
           <<or>> EXTENDS ( <parent-type-name> )

50:3-4. Delete "An <initialization-expr> in the EXTENDS
<type-attr-spec> is for the parent component (4.5.6.1)."

51:13. Change "of a type"
        to "that are declared in a type's <data-component-part>".

[The present text will need correcting even if TC2 is not accepted
since it is wrong for inherited components.]

In addition the following edits from 03-107r1 page 12 should be done

[Remove "the parent component or ".]408:9 
[Remove "public ::"from the extend clause.]433:8 
[Remove these lines.]433:14-17 
[Remove this line.]433:23 
[Replace ","with ")".]433:33 
[Remove "&".]433:33 
[Remove these lines.]433:34-36
