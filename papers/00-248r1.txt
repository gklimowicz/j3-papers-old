As promised at 153, this paper adds a note to Chapter One to mark the
passing of printing (a/k/a "carriage control").

Edits:

3:19+ Add paragraph:
Earlier Fortran standards had the concept of printing, meaning that column
one of formatted output had special meaning for a processor dependent
(possibly empty) set of logical units.  This concept appears to violate 1.4
(3) above, and could be neither detected nor specified by a
standard-specified means.  The interpretation of the first column is no longer
specified by this standard.
