Commenter's Subject was "zeros and sign control"

Paragraph 3 of Section 4.4.3 should explicitly
state that processors that distinguish between
positive and negative zeros shall treat zero
values that are positive zeros as positive
values and negative zeros as negative values
during format editing.

J3's Response:

J3 agrees that the standard should explicitly state
how negative zeroes are represented in formatted output,
but feels that 4.4.3 is not the appropriate place for this. J3
also notes that the text needs to reference "the sign mode of
the connection" when discussing the sign prefix.

Edit:
[10.7.2.1]
Replace subsection (3) with the following:

"On output with I, F, E, EN, ES, D, and G editing, the representation 
of a positive internal value in the field may be prefixed with a plus 
sign, as controlled by the S, SP, and SS edit descriptors or the sign mode 
(9.5.6.17, 9.6.2.14) for the connection. The representation of a negative 
internal value in the field shall be prefixed with a minus sign. If the 
processor distinguishes between positive and negative zero, the 
representation of a negative zero shall be prefixed with a minus sign; 
otherwise, a zero value shall be treated as positive for the purpose 
of determining the sign prefix."
