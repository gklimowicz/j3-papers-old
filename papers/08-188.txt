This is a whack at interp F03/0073.  The outcome is different.

========================================================================

NUMBER: F03/0073
TITLE: C interop of dummy procedures
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, dummy procedures
DEFECT TYPE: ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following interface interoperable, and if yes, what is the
interoperable C prototype?

use iso_c_binding
subroutine my_sub(my_fun) bind(c, name="My_Proc")
    interface
       function my_fun(x) bind(c)
          use iso_c_binding
          integer(c_int) :: my_fun
          real(c_double), value :: x
       end function
    end interface
end subroutine

ANSWER:

Yes, this interface is interoperable with the following prototype:

   void My_Proc(int (*his_fun)(double));

Its formal parameters is of a pointer type, and the referenced type is a
function that is interoperable with my_fun, thus satisfying the
requirements in item 5 in the list in subclause 15.2.6.
