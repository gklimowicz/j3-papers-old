Subject: definition of generic identifier
Date: 2017 October 16
Reference: 17-007r2

1. Discussion

The definition of "generic identifier" in the glossary conflicts with
the definition given in Clause 15.4.3.4.1 Generic identifiers.  The
glossary definition ([14:1-3] 3.79 generic identifier) uses the term
"lexical token", which implies only one lexical token.  The
definition in Clause 15.4.3.4.1 [306:9-307:1] includes cases that
require more than one lexical token. NOTE 15.9 [309] makes it clear
that the sequence of four tokens "ASSIGNMENT ( = )" is a generic
identifier.

The reference to Subclause 15.4.3.4.1 should be raised a level to
capture all cases.

Edits are provided.

2. Edits to 17-007r2

[14:3] 3.79 generic identifier
       Replace "lexical token" with "lexical token sequence".
Replace "assignments (15.4.3.4.1)" with "assignments (15.4.3.4)".
