Subject: Reconsideration of interp F03/0064
Date: 2009 February 11


1. Introduction

Interp F03/0064 failed with a NO vote from Rob James, who claimed that
the edits did not catch two additional examples.  On reexamination of
his examples, it is clear that they are caught by the interp as
provided.


2. Effects of the edit

The edit changes C1212 to read:

  C1212 ... If <name> is declared by a <procedure-declaration-stmt>
        or <interface-body> it shall be previously declared."

3. Reexamination

Example 1:

    MODULE m1
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s(p)
        PROCEDURE(s) :: p
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

This is clearly invalid, since the declaration of "s" in the PROCEDURE
statement is still in progress (until END SUBROUTINE) and therefore "s"
which is being declared by an interface body is *NOT* previously declared.

Example 2:

    MODULE m2
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s1(a)
        PROCEDURE(s2) :: a
      END SUBROUTINE
      SUBROUTINE s2(b)
        PROCEDURE(s1) :: b
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

This is invalid because the interface body for S1 does not have access to
S2.  Furthermore, adding an IMPORT statement is ineffective because of the
requirement
  "An entity that is imported ... and is defined in the host scoping unit
   shall be explicitly declared prior to the interface body."

4. Conclusion

I recommend we pass F03/0064 as is (in 09-006A.txt).
