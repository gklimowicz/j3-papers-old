Subject: UK-2 default accessibility of entities
Date: 2013 September 26

Reference: N1975, N1982

Specification:
1. In a module, the default accessibility of entities
   from another module accessed by use association should
   be decoupled from the default accessibility of entities
   defined by the using module.
2. This should be done by a separate statement, not on the USE
   statement, to avoid confusion when multiple USE statements
   for a module appear.
3. Multiple specifications of the default accessibility
   shall not be permitted.
4. Specification of accessibility shall not be permitted
   for a module that is not referenced by a USE statement.

Syntax:
1. Permit a module name to appear
   in a PUBLIC or PRIVATE statement.
2. At most one appearance of a module name
   in all the PUBLIC and
   PRIVATE statements in a module specification part
   is permitted.

Edits:

{allow module names on accessibility statements}

[102:28+] add "<or> <<module-name>>"

{constrain which module names may so appear}

[102:32+] add two constraints
"C563+ (R525) If <<access-id>> is a <<module-name>>,
the <<module-name>> shall appear on a <<use-stmt>>
that appears prior to the <<access-stmt>> in the module.

C563++ (R525) A <<module-name>> shall appear at most once
in all the <<access-stmt>>s appearing in a module."

{say what a module name on a public/private stmt means}

[102:33] change "<<access-id>>" to "<<use-name>> or
<<generic-spec>>" and add a sentence "An <<access-stmt>>
with a <<module-name>> specifies the accessibility
of entities accessed from the module identified
by <<module-name>>."
