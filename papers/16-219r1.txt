~~~~~~~~~~~

The entries for IMPORT in table 2.2 appear to be dated.
Since an IMPORT statement is now permitted to appear in the
specification part of a submodule, an additional column is
also needed.

Edit:
~~~~~

On page 34, split the third column into two columns, the
third headed "Modules", the fourth headed "Submodules" and
clone all other entries. Then, change the row entries for
IMPORT to

"IMPORT | No | No | Yes | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes"
