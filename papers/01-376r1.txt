From:     Dick Hendrickson
Subject:  Chapter 6 comments, updated from meeting 158

This is an update of 282/R2 from meeting 158.  I deleted the items
that were taken care of at the last meeting to make it easier for the
B team to process.  I kept the same numbering scheme as in 282 so that
notes from last meeting should still be valid.

Page, etc., numbers have been updated to the current 007/R4 PDF version

The edit has been changed from 01-376 by subgroup A.

10)  Page 110[11-12], 6.3.3.2, 2nd paragraph, second sentence.  Seems to
restate the first, or how can a portion be independent of any other
portion?

Edit:

in 007R4

[110:10-12] Replace first two sentences of the paragraph with

"A pointer shall not be deallocated if it is currently associated
with a subobject of an allocated target that is not the whole of
that target."
