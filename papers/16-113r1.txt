Discussion:
----------

In 5.1p1 we have "The type of a named data object is either specified
explicitly in a type declaration statement or determined implicitly by
the first letter of its name (5.7)."  That seems to be out of date
even for F2003 (CLASS(*) declaration).  Certainly misses things
declared TYPE(*).  The minimal fix would be to insert "nonpolymorphic"
before "named data object". Polymorphic ones can acquire a type by
argument association, allocation, or pointer assignment.

Response: This is talking about declarations, and thus about the declared
          type and not the dynamic type.  This should be made clear by
          appropriate insertion of the word "declared".

The same issue exists in 5.2p1, where we have "The type and type
parameters are those specified by declaration-type-spec..." (with an
exception case for CHARACTER type). The <declaration-type-spec> term
includes both CLASS(*) and TYPE(*) syntax options.

Response: As above.

In 5.5.5p3 we say that the BIND attribute for a variable confers the
SAVE attribute. Since such a variable has to be declared in the
specification part of a module, the SAVE is automatic
anyway. Restating that here seems redundant.

Response: Agreed.

R511 <explicit-coshape-spec> appears to be missing a "]" before the
continuation square on the first line.

Response: R511 line 1 contains two "[" and two "]", nothing missing.

5.5.14p1 says "Procedure pointers are described in 12.4.3.7.".  But
12.4.3.7 is Procedure declaration statement. Not really where
procedure pointers are described. 5.5.9 EXTERNAL attribute seems
closer, where we say "... is a procedure pointer". More information is
in 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.2.4.

Response: We don't have a special subclause that describes procedure
          pointers, they seem simple enough anyway.  This sentence should
          just be deleted.

5.5.18p1 has cross references for VALUE. It would be helpful to add a
reference to 12.6.2.2, which contains an important constraint on VALUE
and OPTIONAL.

Response: The constraint on VALUE+OPTIONAL in a BIND procedure should not
          be in the subclause on "Function subprograms" anyway.  It could
          go either with OPTIONAL, VALUE or the general part of procedure
          definition.  Unfortunately 12.6.2.1 does not contain the
          procedure heading suffix, so this constraint would be better
          placed in VALUE.  Edits are provided to move this constraint.

In 5.6.11, rule R551 for <parameter-stmt>, it appears there is an
extra space between <def> and <-list>.

Response: Agreed.

5.7, constraint C590 reads "If IMPLICIT NONE is specified in a scoping
unit, it shall precede any PARAMETER statements that appear in the
scoping unit. No more than one IMPLICIT NONE statement shall appear in
a scoping unit."  This constraint is about statement ordering, but the
beginning phrase is about specification.  This needs rewording.
Propose

"If an IMPLICIT NONE statement appears in a scoping unit, it shall
precede any PARAMETER statements that appear in the scoping unit. No
more than one IMPLICIT NONE statement shall appear in a scoping unit."

Response: Agreed.


Edits to 16-007:
-----

[89:4] In 5.1 Attributes of procedures and data objects, para 1,
change the beginning of the third sentence "The type of a named data"
to "The declared type of a named data".

[89:14] In 5.2 Type declaration statement, para 1, in the first
sentence, after "The type declaration statement specifies the"
insert "declared".

[94:11-12] In 5.5.5 BIND attribute for data entities, in the only
sentence of para 3, "The BIND attribute for ... explicit
specification.", delete "variable or" and make the whole sentence
\obs font.

[103:15-16] In 5.5.14 POINTER attribute, para 1,
            delete the sentence "Procedure pointers are described...".

[105:18+] In 5.5.18 VALUE, at the end of the subclause insert constraint
  "C564a A dummy argument of a procedure with the BIND attribute shall not
         have both the OPTIONAL and VALUE attributes.".
{This is right after the main constraint on disallowed attribute
 combinations with VALUE, so a reasonable location for it.}

[111:7] In 5.6.11 PARAMETER statement, in R551 for <parameter-stmt>,
remove the space between "<named-constant-def>" and "<-list>".

[113:6] 5.7 IMPLICIT statement, para 1,
        "Alternatively, it may"
        ->"An IMPLICIT NONE statement can"
[113:7] After "scoping unit" insert
        ", or that external and dummy procedures need to be explicitly
         given the EXTERNAL attribute".

[113:14] In 5.7 IMPLICIT statement, the first constraint (C590), at
the beginning of the constraint change "If IMPLICIT NONE is specified"
to "If an IMPLICIT NONE statement appears".

[316:41-42] 12.6.2.2 Function subprogram, C1263, delete constraint
  "C1263 A variable that is a dummy ... VALUE attributes.".
{Delete constraint from where no-one is likely to find it.}
