Fortran 90 interface for OpenGL, f90gl, was announced last October by William
Mitchell (see also Fortran Forum, April 1997, page 29). The OpenGL
Architecture Review Board (ARB) is now considering adopting the Fortran 90
bindings on which f90gl is based as the official Fortran 90 bindings for
OpenGL. Toward this end, they are seeking comments from people with an
expertise in Fortran 90. The proposed bindings are defined in the NIST
technical report "A Fortran 90 Interface for OpenGL", which can be obtained
from the f90gl home page <http://math.nist.gov/f90gl>. Supportive comments as
will as critical suggestions are sought.

The proposed bindings allow the user to write standard conforming portable
Fortan programs with the full functionality of OpenGL. The interface is
accessed through modules; this provides explicit interfaces to the OpenGL
procedures for improved robustness.

Kind type parameters are provided for matching Fortran types to C types. This
eliminates the need for nonstandard "*byte" declarations. It also provides a
mechanism for transparent type conversion on systems in which the Fortran
processor does not support all the C types used by OpenGL, for increased
portability.

Fortran derived types are provided where C structs are used in the interface.
This increases the similarity between the Fortran and C interfaces, and
provides a mechanism through which the implementor can encapsulate whatever
interface data is required.

The Fortran functions corresponding to C functions that return a pointer to a
character string now return a pointer to an array of characters. This
increases the similarity between the Fortran and C interfaces, and adds the
capability of arbitrary length character string return values.

Extremely long names are truncated to 31 characters to comply with the Fortran
90 standard, and the prefix is changed to f90gl to avoid name space clashes.
