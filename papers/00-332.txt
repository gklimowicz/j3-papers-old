Subject:  Disposition of /interop issues in 00-301

Paper 00-301 raises three issues with Enums on page 61 of 00-007r3.
The following edits resolve these issues.

Issue: Is an enumeration really a name?
Answer: No, it is a type alias.
Edit: 61:2 Delete "name"

Issue: Is the sentence true even if BIND(C) is not present?
Answer: No.  The sentence is redundant with what is below in item (1).
Edits: 61:4-5 Delete "An entity ... processor (2.5.10)."
           61:22 After "interoperable" add "(16.2)"
           61: 27 After "processor" add "(2.5.10)"

Issue: Is a name an enumeration?
Answer: No.
Edits: 61:19 Change "is an" to "of an"
                     Delete ", which"
