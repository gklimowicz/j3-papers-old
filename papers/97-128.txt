To:      WG5/X3J3
From:    Stan Whitlock/MISC
Subject: MISCellaneous Requirements for F2000

WG5 has already acted on these requirements from the MISC subgroup for F2000:

    o	from paper N1240:

	item		repository	description
	number		number

	 5.1		 5		Exception Handling
	 9.1		63		Stream I/O
	10.1		20		Command Line Args & Environ Vars
	 9.3		68		Any KIND of INTEGER for I/O Specifiers
	 6.2		42		Allow internal procedures as actual
					  arguments, not in recursive hosts
	 9.6		79		Allow TAB character in formatted data
	 ---				Allow TAB character in Fortran source
	11.1		55		Regularize RANDOM_SEED
	 ---				Packed LOGICAL arrays of bits

    o	items to remove from X3J3 Minor Technical Enhancements List in
	97-010:

	M14	Greater than 7 dimensions

These items will be voted on for inclusion as F2000 requirements:

    o	Requirement for Internationalization {I18N}:

	F2000 should support ISO 10646 level 1 characters in data, literals,
	and comments and support dynamic locale switching, all as outlined in
	SC22/WG20 N477 "Guidelines for the Preparation of Programming
	Language Standards" and detailed in SC22/WG20 N476 "Framework for
	Internationalization".

	This requirement specifically does not address using ISO 10646 level
	1 characters in identifiers.

    o	items from Van Snyder's paper 97-114r2:

	 3.2	Provide an intrinsic procedure that takes a status value
		{eg, IOSTAT= or STAT= on ALLOCATE} and returns the associated
		error message as a character string.

	21.0	Provide a SWAP operation to swap two objects as in

			TEMP = A
			A = B
			B = TEMP

	 7.0	Provide a way to determine what I/O unit number would
		produce the same effect as I/O to the pre-connected units

                                                            Page 2 of 2

	23.0	Separating Specification and Implementation in Modules


MISC strongly suggests to all groups modifying and/or reviewing text for
F2000 that they examine carefully all constraints and restrictions, removing
needless constraints and restrictions and adding notes to justify needed
constraints and restrictions.
