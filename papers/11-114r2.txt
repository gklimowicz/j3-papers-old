DISCUSSION


Requirement 8(c) in N1820 says that the lower bounds for an
assumed-shape dummy (or an assumed-rank dummy that is not allocatable
or pointer) are assumed to be zero, as opposed to the default of 1
in Fortran. Edits are supplied to state this.

EDITS to N1838:

[10:19+] Add paragraph

For a descriptor of an assumed-shape array, the value of the
lower-bound member of each element of the dim member of the descriptor
shall be zero.
