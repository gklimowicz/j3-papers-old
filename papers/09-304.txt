NUMBER: F03/?
TITLE: More than one specific interface for a procedure
KEYWORDS: Specific interface
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the example:

  module A
  contains
    subroutine S ( X )
      real :: X
    end subroutine S
  end module A
  module B
    use A, only: T => S
  end module B
  module C
    use A, only: U => S
  end module C
  program P
    use B ! Access the procedure name T
    use C ! Access the procedure name U
    ! T and U are different names for the same procedure.
  end program P

Is this program conforming?

The procedure S defined in the module A has two explicit specific
interfaces in program P.  The sixth paragraph after constraint C1211 in
subclause 12.3.2.1 says "A procedure shall not have more than one explicit
specific interface in a given scoping unit."

ANSWER:

It was intended that this program be conforming.  An edit is provided to
correct this.

EDITS:

[260:1 last sentence of sixth paragraph after constraint C1211 in
subclause 12.3.2.1]
Insert "name" after "procedure".
