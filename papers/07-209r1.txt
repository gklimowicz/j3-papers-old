Discussion

1. There is a problem with OPEN for a file that is conected with a
team of more than one image. If the OPEN would cause a change in the
connect team, the user should close the connection for the old team
and then open it for the new team.

2. We prefer to keep OPEN with TEAM= as an image control statement
even if the team consists of one image, for simplicity and so that
whether or not it is an image control statement can be determined at
compile time.

3. A team synchronization is permitted for a team of one image. It's
trivial, of course.

4. We think users would be surprised and annoyed to find that OPENs
and CLOSEs without TEAM= were prohibited in a critical construct. The
sequence of OPEN, data transfer, and CLOSE within a critical construct
is an important mechanism for managing access to a shared file.


Edit to J3/07-007r1

[217:1] In 9.4.5 OPEN statement, para. 4, line 1, after "connected,
the" add "connections shall have the same connect team
(9.4.5.17). The".
