DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
JP-16)
  5.4 2nd paragraph after R545 and constraints (Page 66  Line 11)
  states that:

  "Any namelist-group-name may occur in  more than one NAMELIST
   statement in a scoping unit."

  Can a namelist-group-name occur more than once in one NAMELIST
  statement ?

  Is the following NAMELIST statement standard conforming ?

     NAMELIST /NLIST/ A, B   /NLIST/ C, D

  If this is standard conforming, is it the same as the
  following ?

     NAMELIST /NLIST/ A, B, C, D

ANSWER:    Yes, the rules should be analogous to those for named
           common blocks at [69:16-19].

EDIT:
[66:11]  Replace "in more than one" by "more than once in the"
[66:11]  Replace "statement" by "statements"
