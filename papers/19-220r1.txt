Subject: Editorial fix to the description of REDUCE intrinsic
Date: 2019-October-14

In the description of the result value of the REDUCE intrinsic in
16.9.161, case iii, the function reference to REDUCE in lines 24-25 of
page 409 is missing the OPERATION and the ORDERED argument. The intent
seems clear.

The following edit corrects the problem.

[409:24-25]
Change
  "Otherwise, ... of REDUCE (ARRAY, DIM = DIM [, MASK = MASK, IDENTITY =
   IDENTITY])"
to
 "Otherwise, ... of REDUCE (ARRAY, OPERATION, DIM = DIM [, MASK = MASK,
   IDENTITY = IDENTITY, ORDERED = ORDERED])"
