1. Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[191:17] 11.1.7.2 Form of the DO construct
 The syntax permits DEFAULT (NONE) to appear more than once in a single
concurrent header in a DO CONCURRENT statement.


2. Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In subgroup we then asked "Is it legal to have LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, and
SHARED repeated in a given concurrent-locality?"  The syntax certainly
permits it and it matches OpenMP's behavior.  However we could not
come up with any other Fortran statements or constructs where keywords
can be repeated.

Straw vote relative to locality specs on a DO CONCURRENT statement
    1) No locality spec should be repeated
    2) Only DEFAULT(NONE) cannot be repeated
    3) They all can be repeated (status quo)
    4) Undecided

Straw vote was taken with the result:
   Option 1: 2
   Option 2: 6
   Option 3: 2
   Option 4: 1
        Direction is option 2.

3. Edit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After C1126, insert new constraint:
[191:17]+ "C1126a The DEFAULT ( NONE ) <<locality-spec>> shall not appear
more than once in a given <<concurrent-locality>>."
