Subject: Procedures in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV should be generic
Date: 2008 September 24


Bob Corbett raised the question of whether or not the procedures in
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, (COMPILER_OPTIONS and
COMPILER_VERSION), are generic or specific.  The texts for other
intrinsic modules state that all procedures are generic, but the
text for ISO_FORTRAN_ENV does not.

For ISO_C_BINDING, 15.2.3.1 states:

"In the detailed descriptions below, procedure names are generic and
not specific."

For IEEE_ARITHMETIC, IEEE_EXCEPTIONS and IEEE_FEATURES, 14.11.1
states:

"In the detailed descriptions in 14.11, procedure names are generic
and are not specific."

However, the corresponding text for ISO_FORTRAN_ENV in 13.8.2.1 says:

"The processor shall provide the named constants, derived type, and
procedures described in subclause 13.8.2."

It appears to have been an oversight that a statement regarding the
generic aspect of procedures was not added when procedures were added
to ISO_FORTRAN_ENV for Fortran 2008. The distinction matters if
it is desired to extend the generic.

A proposed edit is as follows:

[N1723:395:13.8.2.1p2] Immediately after line 2 ("...described in
subclause 13.8.2.) add: "In the detailed descriptions below, procedure
names are generic and not specific."
