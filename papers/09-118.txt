Discussion

Somehow, we seem to have constructed bnf that does not allow a scalar
coarray being accessed as a coindexed object. Also, the bnf does not
allow for cases like P%C[j] where C is a coarray component of P
(which is a structure component). Edits are provided to correct this.

[117:3+] In 6.1 Designator, add to R601
             "<<or>> coindexed-named-object".

[121:2] In 6.4.2 Structure components, para. 5, C620, change
    "rightmost part-ref shall be of the form part-name" to
    "rightmost part-ref shall not have a <section-subscript-list>".

[121:5-] Before 6.4.3 Complex parts, add new subclause

" 6.4.2a Coindexed named objects

 R613a <coindexed-named-object> <<is>> <data-ref>
 C620a (R613a) The <data-ref> shall contain exactly one <part-ref>.
       That <part-ref> shall have an <image-selector> and no
       <section-subscript-list>, and the <part-name> shall be the
       name of a scalar coarray.
