Subject: Co-arrays with non-Fortran main program

Discussion:

Consider the example: A C main program calls an interoperable
Fortran subroutine, both compiled with companion processors. The
current standard guarantees that works---run time library will be
initialized etc.

Now someone rewrote the Fortran routine to use co-arrays (ALLOCATABLE
for example). Can the program suddenly stop working? There are two
options:

1) Yes: The current draft does not specify anything about the
creation of images when the main program is not in Fortran.

2) No: The program should still work. What the value of NUM_IMAGES
will be is outside the standard, but it will be *something* (probably
1 if it is a serial program).

No edits are needed if we choose option 1. Edits for option 2 are
provided below:

Edits for option 2:

[16:11-13] Replace the first sentence with:
"Execution of a program begins by creating a fixed number of instances
of the program. If the program contains a Fortran main program, each
image begins execution with the first executable construct of the
main program."
