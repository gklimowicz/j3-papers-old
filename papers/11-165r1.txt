Reference: N1854


There has been a great deal of cross-purposes discussion on many aspects
that come down to people not closely involved in this group
misunderstanding the purpose and intent of type(*).    I
think that we should spell out the situation rather more bluntly.

Edit to N1854:
---------------

[31:20+] Add a new paragraph:

"Because the purpose of assumed-type is to allow the companion processor
to bypass some of the strictness of the typing in the Fortran standard,
it is not generally a suitable type for use within a Fortran program and
no facilities have been provided to make it more useful for that."
