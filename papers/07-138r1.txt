  UTI 103 (page 330) gives two choices. I believe that the discussion
  at meeting 178 during the discussion of 06-352r3 we agreed to do
  choice 2. Since the editor implemented choice 1, this paper proposes
  reverting back to choice 2. A straw vote is recommended.

  The editor says:

  "2. manual prohibition of binding name:
  -remove the 15.5.2 text inserted by 06-352r3,
  -reinstate C1240 from 06-352r3, and
  -undo my change to C1239."
  The edits for this are given below.

    [481:7] Delete ", an internal procedure,"

    [330:14] Delete "an internal procedure, or of"

    [330:15+] Add a new constraint:
    C1248a (R1229) If a <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for an
    internal procedure, the NAME= specifier shall appear and it shall
    specify that the procedure has no binding label (15.4.1).

Subgroup does not agree.  Subgroup believes that what the editor put in
07-007 is correct.  No straw vote will be requested.

This completes the processing of UTI 103 - it can be deleted.
