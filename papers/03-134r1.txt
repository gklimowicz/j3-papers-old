Subject: Add kind= to iachar


One of the things we agreed to advocate was to add
a kind= to the iachar intrinsic.  Here goes:

EDITS:

291:12 Change "(C)" to "( C [, KIND])"

315:13 Change "(C)" to "( C [, KIND])"

315:17 Change "Argument" to "Arguments"

315:17+ Add
"KIND (optional) shall be a scalar integer initialization expression."

315:18 Change "Default integer." to
"Integer.  If KIND is present, the kind type parameter is that specified
by the value of KIND; otherwise,
the kind type parameter is that of default integer type."
