Subject: missing case in NORM2
Date: 2014 January 24

This is editorial only.  NORM2 13.7.123 page 374 lacks the result value
when the array has zero size.  This paper proposes edits to repair this.

In analogy with DOT_PROCDUCT, a value of zero should be returned
when the argument array has zero size.

Edits:

{against 10-007r1}

{Editor, add the missing sentence}

[374:37] After "X." add a sentence:
"If X has size zero, the result has the value zero."
