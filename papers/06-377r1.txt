[306:34-35] C1220 requires an explicit interface if <proc-language-binding-spec>
is specified. This interface must have BIND(C) in it.
Is it required to have the same NAME= specifier in both the interface and in the
<proc-language-binding-spec>? Or can one add a name in the PROCEDURE statement
if the interface does not have a name?

Answer: The same NAME= specifier is not required in both the interface
and in the <proc-language-binding-spec>. If <proc-language-binding-spec> appears,
the binding label is taken from it, not from the procedure interface.

[335:14] Can a pure procedure have co-array dummies? Does C1286 apply
to dummy arguments?

Answer: Yes and yes. A pure procedure can have co-array dummies, however,
it can only reference, not define, co-indexed objects. This
includes sub-objects of co-array dummies.
