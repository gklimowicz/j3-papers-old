1. Introduction

In FORTRAN 77, subprograms included BLOCK DATA subprograms.
In recent Fortran standards, block data program units are
not subprograms.  Almost all uses of the term "block data
subprogram" have been eliminated.  One use remains in
subclause 8.5.9 EXTERNAL attribute [101:25].  An edit is
provided to replace the remaining use.


2. Edit

[101:25, 8.5.9 "EXTERNAL attribute" p1]

Replace "block data subprogram" with "block data program unit".
