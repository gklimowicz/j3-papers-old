F03/0028   Commas in complex namelist output

  Rich Bleikamp's NO comment for F03/0028:

    I agree with Rob:  the first edit needs to be reworked.

  Dick Hendrickson's NO comment for F03/0028:

    I agree with Rob James, the first edit is awkward.  Perhaps
    something like ", comma or semicolon depending on the decimal
    edit mode, " could be made to work.

  Michael Ingrassia's NO comment for F03/0028:

    Just piling on, the edit needs work as Rob James has pointed out.

  Rob James' NO comment for F03/0028:

    The first edit doesn't work.  The resulting sentence reads:
    If the delimiters are omitted, the character sequence is
    terminated by the first blank, comma, or semicolon if the
    decimal edit mode is decimal, slash, or end of record;  in
    this case apostrophes and quotation marks within the datum
    are not to be doubled.

    This appears to say that the decimal edit mode can be decimal,
    slash, or end of record.

  Bill Long's NO comment for F03/0028:

    I agree with Rob that the wording resulting from the first edit
    is confusing, and needs to be redone.

  Jeanne Martin's NO comment for F03/0028:

    The edit is unclear, perhaps rearranging the list or making the
    sentence into two would clarify it.

  Van Snyder's NO comment for F03/0028:

    I agree with Rob.  The first edit is defective.

  Matthijs van Waveren's NO comment for F03/0028:

    The first edit is incorrect.

  Stan Whitlock's NO comment for F03/0028:

    I agree with RobJ:  the first edit needs to be reworked.

  Conclusion on F03/0028:  Failed J3 letter ballot #11

F03/0033   IEEE_VALUE()

  Rob James' YES comment for F03/0033:

    It might be nice to add a sentence like the following to the
    answer:

      The specification for IEEE_VALUE appears in 14.10.36.

  Conclusion on F03/0033:  Comment not accepted
                           Passed J3 letter ballot #11

F03/0047   Polymorphic arguments to intrinsic procedures

  Rob James' NO comment for F03/0047 that changed to YES:

    The answer fails to account for type parameters.

    After looking again, it seems that the descriptions for the
    affected intrinsic procedures already account for type parameters.
    I'd like to change my vote for F03/0047 to YES.


F03/0048   Control edit descriptors in UDDTIO

  Dick Hendrickson's NO comment for F03/0048:

    Where does it say that "record position" means the same as "file
    position".  Does the standard actually say that, or is that just
    our intent?  If it's our intent, we should actually define record
    position.

  Bill Long's NO comment for F03/0048:

    I agree with the conclusion (that the program is conforming) but
    not with the first sentence of the Answer.   The terms "record
    position" and "file position" do not mean the same thing. We've
    even had previous interps where the difference was the core of
    the answer to the question.  Record position is the character
    position within the current record, as used in 10.7.1.  File
    position specifies which record (if any) is the current record,
    as used in 10.7.2 and 9.7.

    I believe that the originally cited text:

      9.5.3.7.2 states:
      A record positioning edit descriptor, such as TL and TR, used on
      unit by a child data transfer statement shall not cause the
      record position to be positioned before the record position at
      the time the user-defined derived-type input/output procedure
      was invoked.

    was intended to say that "...shall not be positioned before the
    record position within the record that was current at the time
    the user-defined...".  The intent is to prevent the child data
    transfer from positioning the record position to the left of
    where it was when the child was called, so to prevent the parent
    from unknowingly overwriting the characters it had previously
    written.  If the child starts a new record, as is the case in the
    example, then this protection is no longer an issue.

    I would suggest deleting the first sentence of the Answer
    (because it is wrong), keeping the second sentence, and perhaps
    adding a clarifying edit to the 9.5.3.7.2 text.

  Jeanne Martin's NO comment for F03/0048:

    I agree with Bill Long's comment - record position and file
    position are not the same.

  Van Snyder's NO comment for F03/0048:

    I agree with Dick.  I couldn't find any support for the assertion
    that "The term 'record position' means the same as the term 'file
    position.'"

  Conclusion on F03/0048:  Failed J3 letter ballot #11

F03/0049   Separators in list-directed output involving UDDTIO

  Dick Hendrickson's NO comment for F03/0049:

    The answers to both 1 and 2 say "It is the intent of the
    standard..."  How do we know this?  There should be a reference
    to the section that says this, or the words that say it should be
    added to the standard.

  Jeanne Martin's YES comment for F03/0049:

    Perhaps a reference to 9.5.3.7.2 might be helpful in answers 1
    and 2, but it is a long subsection and the relevant information
    is near the middle.

  Van Snyder's NO comment for F03/0049:

    I thought about voting "yes with comment," but upon reflection
    concluded that the standard ought to say what its intent is,
    rather than relying on an interp answer that doesn't result in any
    words in a corrigendum.

  Conclusion on F03/0049:  Failed J3 letter ballot #11

F03/0051   Repeat specifiers and UDDTIO

  Michael Ingrassia's NO comment for F03/0051:

    John Reid has raised the issue of whether it requires all r values
    c in r*c to be transferred to effective list items; I am willing
    to change to YES after hearing a satisfactory answer.

  Rob James' YES comment for F03/0051:

    The end of the answer should read "in this case", not "is this
    case".  Also, in the edit, "list directed" should be
    "list-directed".

  Jeanne Martin's NO comment for F03/0051:

    Vote will change to yes if edits mentioned by Rob James are
    applied.

  John Reid's comment on F03/0051:

    I do not have a vote, but if I did, I would comment on the edit
    in f03/0051. It uses the term 'consume', which is not used
    anywhere else in the standard and whose meaning I can only guess.
    Also, it suggests that it is obligatory for all r values c to be
    transferred to effective list items. Here is a possible
    alternative edit for the same place:

      "If the form <r*c> appears in a list-directed record, all the
       processing of the constants <c> that occurs shall be performed
       during the execution of a non-child list-directed input
       statement or a single execution of the whole of a chain of
       parent-child input statements."

  Conclusion on F03/0051:  Failed J3 letter ballot #11
