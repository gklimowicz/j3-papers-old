Subject: Binding labels for internal interoperable procedures
Date: 2007 January 26
References: 06-352r3, 07-007, UTI 103

UTI 103 (page 330) gives two choices. I believe that the discussion
at meeting 178 during the discussion of 06-352r3 we agreed to do
choice 2. Since the editor implemented choice 1, this paper proposes
reverting back to choice 2. A straw vote is recommended.

The editor says:

"2. manual prohibition of binding name:
-remove the 15.5.2 text inserted by 06-352r3,
-reinstate C1240 from 06-352r3, and
-undo my change to C1239."
The edits for this are given below.

Edits
---------

[481:7] Delete ", an internal procedure,"

[330:15+] Add a new constraint:
C1248a (R1229) If a <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for an
internal procedure, the NAME= specifier shall appear and it shall
specify that the procedure has no binding label (15.4.1).
