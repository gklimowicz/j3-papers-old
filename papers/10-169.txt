QUESTION:

Consider
  INTEGER :: n1(10) = 1,n2(2,3,4,5) = 2
  ...
  PRINT *,BESSEL_JN(n1,n2,[1.0,2.0])

The description of BESSEL_JN, transformational version, merely states
that N1 and N2 "shall be of type integer and nonnegative", and for X
merely states that it "shall be of type real".  There is no
requirement on rank or conformability.

Is this conforming, and if so, what value(s) should it print?

A similar question applies to BESSEL_YN.

ANSWER:

This was not intended to be conforming.  The N1 and N2 arguments
should have been required to be scalar, as should the X argument for
the transformational version of the function.  Edits are supplied to
correct this oversight.

A similar answer pertains to the similar question for BESSEL_YN, and
similar edits are supplied.

EDITS to 10-007:

[333:12,13] In 13.7.24p3, lines beginning N1 and N2,
            replace "of type integer and nonnegative"
            by "an integer scalar with a nonnegative value".

[333:14] In 13.7.24p3, line beginning X, after "real" insert
         "; if the function is transformational, X shall be scalar".
{ALTERNATIVE "; if N1 appears, X shall be scalar".}

[334:12,13] In 13.7.27p3, lines beginning N1 and N2,
            replace "of type integer and nonnegative"
            by "an integer scalar with a nonnegative value".

[334:14] In 13.7.27p3, line beginning X, after "real" insert
         "; if the function is transformational, X shall be scalar".
{ALTERNATIVE "; if N1 appears, X shall be scalar".}
