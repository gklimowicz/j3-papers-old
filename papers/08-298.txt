Discussion:

There is an ambiguity in the standard about exactly when a procedure
call starts and finishes, which affects whether the restriction
defined in 12.5.2.13 (and probably others) applies to the time when
arguments are being copied in and out.  This refers to constructions
like the following:

    INTEGER, SAVE :: array(10)[*] = 0
    CALL Fred(array(::2))

    SUBROUTINE Fred (arg)
    INTEGER :: arg(*)
        ...
    END SUBROUTINE Fred

There should be a NOTE to clarify this.

Edit to J3/08-007r2:

[298:12.5.2.13:Note 12.39+] At the end of "12.5.2.13 Restrictions on
entities associated with dummy arguments" add a new Note after Note
12.39:

NOTE 12.39a
    The term "during the execution of the procedure" includes the
    process of setting up the procedure's environment and restoring
    the calling procedure's environment.  For example, if the
    copy-in/copy-out mechanism is used for arguments, the duration
    of that process is included.
End NOTE
