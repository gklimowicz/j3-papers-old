	           X3J3/96-007R1

Rationale:

Given the following declarations:

real, target  :: b(0:9)
real, pointer :: a(:), b_first(:), b_last(:)

The situation with Fortran 95 is:

a => b                  ! bounds are (0:9)
a => b(:)               ! bounds are (1:10)
b_first => b(0:4)       ! bounds are (1:5)
b_last => b(5:9)        ! bounds are (1:5)

There is no way for the user to alter this determination of bounds.

This proposal changes that by adding an optional lower bound specifier to
the left side of the pointer assignment statement.  This allows a user
to write:

a(0:) => b              ! bounds are (0:9)
a(0:) => b(:)           ! bounds are (0:9)
b_first(0:) => b(0:4)   ! bounds are (0:4)
b_last(5:) => b(5:9)    ! bounds are (5:9)
b_last(0:) => b(5:9)    ! bounds are (0:4)

R736 pointer-assignment-stmt is  pointer-object [ (bounds-spec-list) ] => target

R736a bounds-spec            is  lower-bound :

Constraint:  The number of <bounds-spec>s specified shall be equal to the rank
	     of <pointer-object>.

  (2)  They are specified in a pointer assignment statement.  If a
       <bounds-spec-list> is present, it specifies the lower bound for each
       dimension that is not of zero extent.  The lower bound for a dimension
       of zero extent is 1.  The extent of a dimension of a pointer is the
       extent of the corresponding dimension of the target.  If the lower
       bound is d and the extent of the corresponding dimension of the target
       is s, the value of the upper bound is s + d - 1.  If the lower bounds
       are not specified, the lower bound of each dimension is the result of
       the intrinsic function LBOUND (13.14.53) applied to the correspon-
       ding dimension of the target.
