Subject:   Extension to PRESENT

1. Introduction
===============

If an argument is changed from optional to nonoptional, one must find
and eliminate all references to the OPTIONAL intrinsic function.  It
would be more convenient if the result of PRESENT were true for
nonoptional arguments.

2. Proposal
===========

Allow a nonoptional argument to PRESENT, with the result being true in
that case.

3. Edits
========

[391:16 13.8.143p3] Replace "an optional" with "a"

[391:19 13.8.143p5] Replace "A is present" with "A is not optional or A
is optional and present".  Insert a comma after "(12.5.2.12)".

4. Remark
=========

It would be helpful if processors were to note (but of course not
reject) the appearance of a nonoptional dummy argument as the actual
argument to PRESENT.  This would help users gradually to eliminate them.
