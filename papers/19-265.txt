Technologies (AEiC 2020 aka Ada-Europe 2020) will take place in
Santander, Spain, in the week of 8-12 June.  The conference schedule
includes a technical program and vendor exhibition, and parallel
tutorials and workshops.

The 2020 edition of the conference continues the major revamp
in the registration fees introduced in 2019, redesigned to extend
participation from industry and academia, and to reward contributors,
especially but not solely, students and post-doc researchers.

*** Topics

The conference is a leading international forum for providers,
practitioners and researchers in reliable software technologies.
The conference presentations will illustrate current work in the
theory and practice of the design, development and maintenance of
long-lived, high-quality software systems for a challenging variety of
application domains.  The program will allow ample time for keynotes,
Q&A sessions and discussions, and social events.  Participants include
practitioners and researchers from industry, academia and government
organizations active in the promotion and development of reliable
software technologies.

*** Call for Journal-Track Papers

The journal-track papers submitted to the conference are full-length
papers that must describe mature research work on the conference
topics.  They must be original and shall undergo anonymous peer review.

Accepted journal-track papers will get a presentation slot within
a technical session of the conference and they will be published in
an open-access special issue of the Journal of Systems Architecture
with no additional costs to authors.

The corresponding authors shall submit their work by 7 January 2020
via the Special Issue web page:
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-architecture/
call-for-papers/advances-in-reliable-software-technologies

*** Call for WiP-Track Papers

The Work-in-Progress papers (WiP-track) are short (4-page) papers
describing evolving and early-stage ideas or new research directions.
They must be original and shall undergo anonymous peer review.
The corresponding authors shall submit their work by 31 March 2020, via
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aeic2020, strictly in PDF and
following the Ada User Journal style (http://www.ada-europe.org/auj/).

Authors of accepted WiP-track papers will get a presentation slot
within a regular technical session of the conference and will also
be requested to present a poster.  The papers will be published in
the Ada User Journal as part of the proceedings of the Conference.

The conference is listed in the principal citation databases,
including DBLP, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.  The Ada
User Journal is indexed by Scopus and by EBSCOhost in the Academic
Search Ultimate database.

*** Call for Industrial Presentations

The conference seeks industrial presentations that deliver
insightful information value but may not sustain the strictness
of the review process required for regular papers.  The authors
of industrial presentations shall submit their proposals, in the
form of a short (one or two pages) abstract, by 7 January 2020, via
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aeic2020, strictly in PDF and
following the Ada User Journal style (http://www.ada-europe.org/auj/).

The Industrial Committee will review the submissions anonymously and
make recommendations for acceptance.  The abstract of the accepted
contributions will be included in the conference booklet, and authors
will get a presentation slot within a regular technical session of
the conference.

These authors will also be invited to expand their contributions
into articles for publication in the Ada User Journal, as part of
the proceedings of the Industrial Program of the Conference.

*** Awards

Ada-Europe will offer an honorary award for the best presentation.

*** Call for Educational Tutorials

The conference is seeking tutorials in the form of educational seminars
including hands-on or practical demonstrations.  Proposed tutorials
can be from any part of the reliable software domain, they may be
purely academic or from an industrial base making use of tools used in
current software development environments.  We are also interested in
contemporary software topics, such as IoT and artificial intelligence
and their application to reliability and safety.

Tutorial proposals shall include a title, an abstract, a description
of the topic, an outline of the presentation, the proposed duration
(half day or full day), and the intended level of the tutorial
(introductory, intermediate, or advanced).  All proposals should be
submitted by e-mail to the Educational Tutorial Chair.

The authors of accepted full-day tutorials will receive a complimentary
conference registration.  For half-day tutorials, this benefit is
halved.  The Ada User Journal will offer space for the publication
of summaries of the accepted tutorials.

*** Call for Workshops

Workshops on themes that fall within the conference scope may be
proposed.  Proposals may be submitted for half- or full-day events, to
be scheduled at either end of the conference days.  Workshop proposals
should be submitted by e-mail to the Workshop Chair.  The workshop
organizer shall also commit to producing the proceedings of the event,
for publication in the Ada User Journal.

*** Call for Exhibitors

The commercial exhibition will span the core days of the main
conference.  Vendors and providers of software products and services
should contact the Exhibition Chair for information and for allowing
suitable planning of the exhibition space and time.

*** Special Registration Fees

Authors of accepted contributions and all students will enjoy reduced
registration fees.

*** Venue

Santander is a nice tourist city in the north of Spain, with a
well-connected airport and at a 100 km drive from Bilbao airport.

The conference venue and hotel is the Bahia Hotel in the city center
and beside Santander bay.
