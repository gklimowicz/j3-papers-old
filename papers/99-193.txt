QUESTION:

The standard currently requires a real zero to be
written in exponential form when using list-directed
or namelist output.  Is this requirement intentional
or an oversight?

ANSWER:

The requirement is an oversight.

Discussion:

The G edit descriptor was changed in Fortran 90 to
format a real zero as if an F edit descriptor were
provided in most cases.  The same change was not
made for list-directed or namelist output.

I can attest that users hate having the value zero
written in exponential form when using list-directed
output.  They hate the leading blanks at the start
of lines more, but that behavior is clearly
intentional.

   The real value zero may be output using either
   a 0PFw.d or a 1PEw.dEe edit descriptor.

to the fifth paragraph of Section 10.8.2.
