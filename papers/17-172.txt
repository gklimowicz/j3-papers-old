Discussion:

Comment US004 points out that the text in 5.4.8 Established coarrays,
para 5, omits mention of a nonallocatable coarray that is an
associating entity in an ASSOCIATE, SELECT RANK, or SELECT TYPE
construct.

A further problem is that a nonallocatable coarray that is a local
variable of a subprogram or is declared in a BLOCK construct is
required to have the SAVE attribute. This means that it is
established in the initial team. This case is covered in para 1, so
para 5 should be deleted.

Edits are proposed.

Edits to N2123:

[46:6+] In 5.4.8 Established coarrays, after para 3 add para
"A nonallocatable coarray that is an associating entity in an ASSOCIATE,
SELECT RANK, or SELECT TYPE construct is established in the team in
which the ASSOCIATE, SELECT RANK, or SELECT TYPE statement is
executed."

[46:10-12] In 5.4.8 Established coarrays, delete para 5.
