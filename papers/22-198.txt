Subject: Fortran vulnerabilities liason report
Date: 2022-October-17


John Reid, Steve Lionel, and myself continue to meet biweekly with
Stephen Michell and Erhard Ploedereder of WG23ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC22/WG 23
(Programming Language Vulnerabilities) to produce a technical report
on vulnerabilities.  Major progress has been made, with special thanks
to John Reid who has scoured the existing draft for problems and
provided substantial sections of improved text.

The work itself moves from section to section and is difficult to
summarize in this format.  The most recent activity has involved the
sections on unspecified behavior, undefined behavior, and
implementation-dependent behavior.  (I missed the last meeting, so
might be behind.)
