Subject: UTI 112 (p211): Image control statement problems with OPEN

Discussion

1. An edit was made at the previous meeting to require that an OPEN
for a file that is connected with a team of more than one image should
specify the same image team. It is our view that if the OPEN would
cause a change in the connect team, the user should close the
connection for the old team and then open it for the new team. This
makes a clear statement to the reader that the change of team was
intended.

2. We prefer to keep OPEN with TEAM= as an image control statement
even if the team consists of one image, for simplicity and so that
whether or not it is an image control statement can be determined at
compile time.

3. A team synchronization is permitted for a team of one image. It's
trivial, of course.

4. We think users would be surprised and annoyed to find that OPENs
and CLOSEs without TEAM= were prohibited in a critical construct. The
sequence of OPEN, data transfer, and CLOSE within a critical construct
is an important mechanism for managing access to a shared file.
