Subject: put random_init() in annex a
Date: 2015 February 23

Reference: 15-007

With all the discussion, somehow random_init() didn't get a place
in Annex A.  This paper attempts to correct the oversight.

Edits:

{mention random_init in annex a}

{place before random_number to be in the same order as clause 13}

[497:11-] add the random_init bullet item
"the value assigned to the pseudorandom number generator
seed by the intrinsic subroutine RANDOM_INIT (13.7.137);"
