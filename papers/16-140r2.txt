1. Introduction

This paper contains some editorial corrections to clause 14.
Some edits in 16-140 are not included as either they were not considered
to be improvements or were not correct (for example, the suggested changes
to IEEE_INT had technical effect and were thus incorrect).

2. Edits to 16-007

[425:28:28+] 14.3 The exceptions, p3,
             Append the sentence in NOTE 14.3 to paragraph 3,
             and delete the now-empty note.
{The note is phrased as normative text.  It is unclear how to prove
 the note from other normative text, so it probably needs to be
 normative itself.}

[430] 14.10 Summary of the procedures, Table 14.2,
      In the rows for IEEE_GET_STATUS and IEEE_SET_STATUS,
      replace "state" with "status" (twice).
{That's what we call it.}

[431:4] 14.11.1, p1,
        After "pure" insert "and all the subroutines are impure".
{Specify the impurity of essence.}

[434:20 14.11.9p1] Replace "state" with "status".
{That's what we call it.}

[445:36] 14.11.38 IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE, p3 Arguments,
         ROUND_VALUE argument,
         Before "mode to be set" insert "rounding".
{Supreme nitpickery.}

[445:38] RADIX argument, ", otherwise" -> "; otherwise".
{No, this is the supremest nitpickery.}

[446:14] 14.11.39 IEEE_SET_STATUS, p1 Description,
         "state" -> "status".
{Consistency.}
