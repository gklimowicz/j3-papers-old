Subject:    Clause 14, IEEE_TYPES
References: J3/06-007r1, UTI 90

Page 440 describes the 5 IEEE types and says their components are
private.  Does UTI 90 (from page 436) should also apply to
these types.  Are the IEE types extensible, BIND(C), etc., do they
have CO_ARRAY components?

Response:  No, UTI 90 does not apply to the IEEE and C interop types.
These types were defined in Fortran 2003 and their properties are
what they are.  For example, they are not sequence or BIND(C)
because they were not defined that way.  As a result, they are
extensible.  However, we should limit some of the newer features
for the older types.  

Edit:  440:23.  Add a new last sentence " They do not have any
co-array components."

Edit:  474:2.  Add a new sentence  after "private components."
" They do not have any co-array components."

The following edit responds to UTI 90 on page 436.

Edit:  After 436:9 insert.
"It shall not be a sequence type, not have the BIND(C) attribute,
not be extensible, not have pointer or co-array components, and
not have type bound procedures."

There's a potential problem with the last edit in that nonsequence
nonbind(c) types are extensible according to 72:6.  A possible
solution is
72:6 after "extensible type" add "unless it is image_team (13.8.3.7)
which is not extensible"
Alternatively, we could delete image_team.  It apparently is only
used in UTI's and as a possible result from INQUIRE (TEAM=...)
