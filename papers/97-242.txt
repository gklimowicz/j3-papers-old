Subject:      Interpretation Request: Character Length Specification
                                      of a Function Result

NUMBER:       6
TITLE:        Character length specification of a function result
KEYWORDS:     character, function result
DEFECT TYPE:  Interpretation
STATUS:       X3J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM main
      CHARACTER(8) arg, func
      EXTERNAL func
      CALL sub(arg, func)
      END PROGRAM

  
      SUBROUTINE sub(arg, func)
      CHARACTER(*) arg, func
      CHARACTER(8) str
      str = func(arg)
      ...
      END SUBROUTINE


      CHARACTER(8) FUNCTION func(arg)
      CHARACTER(*) arg
      ...
      END FUNCTION

Some implementations error the reference to FUNC in subroutine SUB and some
do not.  The implementations that do not error the reference to FUNC use
essentially the following as the argument for allowing the reference:

  The rules for when an asterisk can be used to specify character length
  are specified on in section 5.1.1.5 (middle of page 51 of the Fortran 95
  standard).

    * The first rule states that an asterisk may be used to declare a
      dummy argument of a procedure.  It is clear that FUNC is a dummy
      argument of SUB.

    * The third rule says that in an external function, the length of the
      result may be specified within the function itself with an asterisk
      but if the result length is so specified, any invoker of the function
      must specify the character length of the function result as something
      other than an asterisk.  But the function that is being invoked in 
      the above example does not declare its result length using the
      asterisk, so this rule does not apply.

Is the above sample program a standard conforming program with respect to
the concept of declaring the function result length in the invoking program
as an asterisk?
