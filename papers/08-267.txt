Subject: restriction on coindexed objects with allocatable components
Date: 2008 August 13
References: J3/08-007r2 (WG5/N1723)

Discussion:

When a coindexed object is referenced, its allocatable components
might be copied (e.g. see Note 12.23 on page 289 for actual argument
being a coindexed object). Copying allocatable components might cause
technical difficulties to implementers if the components are of either
polymorphic type or of derived type with length type parameters due to
the similar reasons specified in 08-143r3.  Therefore we propose to
add restrictions to disallow these cases for coindexed objects.

Similarly, there also exists a problem when referencing a polymorphic
coindexed object.


EDITS to 08-007r2 (WG5 N1723):

[117: 6.4.2]  Insert a new constraint in 6.4.2 Structure components

C616a (R611): If <image-selector> appears, <data-ref> shall not be
  polymorphic or be a type that has an allocatable ultimate component
  that is either polymorphic or of a derived type with length type
  parameters.
