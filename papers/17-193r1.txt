To:         J3 Members                                J3/17-193r1
From:       David Muxworthy & Steve Lionel
Subject:    Informal name of the revised language
Date: 2017 October 19

Discussion:
----------

The following was discussed as a proposal for the UK vote on the
second CD.  It gained near-unanimous support but as we operate by
consensus it was not included in the final vote.  This is to bring it
to the attention of J3 for information and possible action.

Proposal:
--------

The language should renamed Fortran 2017 since it has developed
incrementally over the past two years and it is no longer true that
the final definition took place in 2015.

Rationale:
---------

We have had:

content     informal  published
finalized   name

1990        90        1991
1996        95        1997
2004        03        2004
2010        08        2010

A three-year gap is looking too far backwards and would make it look
as if the language were out of date already.  Fortran already suffers
in some quarters from the perception that it exists only as a legacy
language and to publish Fortran 2015 in 2018 could even attract
derision.

Other comments arising during the discussion were to use Fortran 2018,
Fortran 2020 (the language for the future) or to use a naming scheme
without a year in it.

J3 Response
-----------

J3 had an extensive discussion on this issue at meeting 214. Everyone
agreed that there is a perception problem, but some felt it was too
late in the process to change the name. It was noted that past Fortran
standards have changed their year number (Fortran 88 became Fortran 8X
and then Fortran 90, Fortran 2000 became Fortran 2003), and C++ was
calling its revision "C++1X" until publication changed it to C++17.

The name "Fortran 2015" is already in widespread use - changing it now
could cause confusion, along with some rework by compiler vendors as
well as book/paper authors. Among vendor representatives present
there were proponents of both sides.

A straw vote was held among those in the room. Four votes favored
keeping 2015 in the name, five votes favored changing the year number
to 2018, and three were undecided. This doesn't give an obvious sense
of direction by J3. WG5 will be asked to vote on this issue.

What everyone did agree on was that we should immediately start calling
the next revision "Fortran 202X".
