Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, the GB comment
083 reads:

"The addition of a new interoperable type is not mentioned in the
introduction."

with the suggested edit:

"Under bullet point "Features previously described by ISO/IEC TS
29113:2012", following the sentence "The FPTR argument to
C_F_PROCPOINTER ... pointer." add a new sentence "There is a new
interoperable type C_PTRDIFF_T."."

Discussion
----------

C_PTRDIFF_T is a named constant in the ISO_C_BINDING module that
represents a KIND value for the Fortran INTEGER type. It is very
likely the same value as either C_INT64_T or C_INT32_T.  The purpose
is to provide interoperability with the C type ptrdiff_t.

We agree that there is no mention of this in the Introduction, but
propose a slightly different wording for the edit.



Edit to N2146
-------------

[xix:p2] In the Introduction, paragraph 2, Under bullet point
"Features previously described by ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012", following
the sentence "The FPTR argument to C_F_PROCPOINTER ... pointer." add a
new sentence:

"There is a new named constant C_PTRDIFF_T to provide interoperability
with the C type ptrdiff_t."
