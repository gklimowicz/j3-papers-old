Subject: Withdraw equest for Interpretation of rules allowing
         duplicate names

Paper 00-246 requested an interpretation.  It now appears that
improved wording would make things obvious.

[342:14]
  Replace ``(12.3.2.1)'' by ``as explained in 12.3.2.1'' so as to make
  it clear that the exception is explained in 12.3.2.1, rather than
  that generid names are defined in 12.3.2.1.
