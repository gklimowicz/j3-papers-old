Subject: Pointers & C Interop

Due to an oversight on my part, one issue
from WG5 in London was not considered at 158,
to wit, conversion of C pointers to Fortran
pointers.  This is an issue raised by
Bill Mitchell's paper 00-121, A. Donev's
paper 01-232, and John Reid's N1442.

Subgroup C should meet as Interop as briefly
as possible Monday morning to write the paper
which either provides the functionality
(malloc in C, use in Fortran) or definitively
explains why this cannot be (well) done.

I'll not attempt it here because I'm not on
Interop and I'd probably just foul the issue
and the answer.
