1. Introduction
===============

This paper is a revision of 14-169, which was not processed at 204.

If protected types, as described in 14-165, had been provided, this
paper would be largely irrelevant.

If one were to extend a type that does not involve type LOCK_TYPE, and
add a component of type LOCK_TYPE, the processor could not see the
LOCK_TYPE component in references to a polymorphic variable of the base
type.  Constraints against tampering with objects or subobjects of type
LOCK_TYPE would then be powerless.

Constraint C438 prevents this extension, but does not completely protect
lock variables against unauthorized tampering.

It doesn't (and cannot) prevent allocating an unlimited polymorphic
object with a <type-spec> that specifies type LOCK_TYPE or a type that
contains a LOCK_TYPE component, or using a <source-expr> of such a type.

Subclause 13.8.2.16 doesn't actually say that lock variables are not
definable except by executing LOCK and UNLOCK statements.  It gives a
false sense of security by constraining against their appearance in
variable-definition contexts.

Straw vote: Do we want to

1) leave things as they are,
2) impose a run-time prohibition against meddling with lock variables by
   saying in subclause 13.8.2.16 that they're not definable except by
   executing LOCK and UNLOCK statements,
3) constrain against unlimited polymorphic objects having dynamic types
   involving LOCK_TYPE, or
4) Both 2) and 3), because otherwise there's still a loophole involving
   C_LOC and C_F_POINTER?

   {Outcome 3 compromises the principle that unlimited polymorphic means
   "unlimited."  It is incompatible with Fortran 2008.  Should it be
   processed as an interpretation?}

2. Edits to 14-007r2 assuming we only want a runtime prohibition
   against meddling
================================================================

[408:13 13.8.2.16p2] Before "A lock variable" insert "A lock variable is
not definable except by executing a LOCK or UNLOCK statement."

[408:24+ C1304+] Optional:  Add a paragraph:

"The type LOCK_TYPE shall have a type-bound defined assignment
subroutine that executes an ERROR STOP statement (8.4)."

3. Edits 14-007r2 to constrain against unlimited polymorphic with
   dynamic type involving LOCK_TYPE
=================================================================

[25:14+ 1.6.3p1+] Insert paragraphs:

"Fortran 2008 allowed to allocate an unlimited polymorphic object with a
dynamic type of LOCK_TYPE, or a type that has a potential subobject
component of type LOCK_TYPE; that is not permitted by this part of
ISO/IEC 1539.

"Fortran 2008 allowed an <expr> of type LOCK_TYPE, or of a type that has
a subobject of type LOCK_TYPE, in an intrinsic assignment statement if
the variable is unlimited polymorphic; that is not permitted by this
part of ISO/IEC 1539.

"Fortran 2008 allowed a <data-target> of type LOCK_TYPE, or of a type
that has a potential subobject component of type LOCK_TYPE, if the
<data-pointer-object> in a pointer assignment statement is unlimited
polymorphic; that is not permitted by this part of ISO/IEC 1539."

[131:9-10] Replace C643:

"C643  (R626) The declared type of <source-expr> shall not be C_PTR or
       C_FUNPTR if an <allocate-object> is a coarray.

{The prohibitions in the current C643 against copying lock variables
during allocation reappear below in revisions of C1303 and C1304.  The
term "subcomponent" was wrong anyway; it should have been "potential
subobject component."}

"C643a (R626) The declared type of <source-expr> shall not be LOCK_TYPE
       or have a potential subobject component of type LOCK_TYPE, and
       <type-spec> shall not specify LOCK_TYPE or a type that has a
       potential subobject component of type LOCK_TYPE, if any
       <allocate-object> is unlimited polymorphic."

{or maybe}

"C643a (R626) Executing an ALLOCATE statement shall not cause an
       unlimited polymorphic object to have a subobject of type
       LOCK_TYPE, or its dynamic type to become LOCK_TYPE."

[157:11+ 7.2.1.2p1(1)+] Insert a list item

  "(1') If the variable is unlimited polymorphic, <expr> shall not be of
        type LOCK_TYPE or have a subobject of type LOCK_TYPE."

[162:6+ C716+] Insert a constraint:

"C716a (R733) If <data-pointer-object> is unlimited polymorphic,
       <data-target> shall not be of type LOCK_TYPE or have a subobject
       of type LOCK_TYPE."

[408:13 13.8.2.16p2] Before "A lock variable" insert "A lock variable is
not definable except by executing a LOCK or UNLOCK statement."
{Wearing both a belt and suspenders helps prevent getting caught with
your pants down.}

[408:20 C1303] To be parallel to how copying objects of type EVENT_TYPE
       is prevented in TS 18508, replace "<allocate-object>" with
       "<allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement that does not have a
       SOURCE= specifier, an <allocate-object> in a DEALLOCATE
       statement".

[408:23 C1304] To be parallel to how copying variables that have
       subobjects of type EVENT_TYPE is prevented in TS 18508, replace
       "<allocate-object>" with "<allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE
       statement that does not have a SOURCE= specifier, an
       <allocate-object> in a DEALLOCATE statement,".

[408:24+ C1304+] Insert a constraint

"C1305 A variable of type LOCK_TYPE, or that has a subobject of type
       LOCK_TYPE, shall not be an actual argument that corresponds to an
       unlimited polymorphic dummy argument."

Optional:  Add a paragraph:

"The type LOCK_TYPE shall have a type-bound defined assignment
subroutine that executes an ERROR STOP statement (8.4)."
