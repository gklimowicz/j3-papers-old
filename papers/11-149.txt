DISCUSSION

The description of the CFI_attribute_assumed includes assumed-rank
objects. Assumed rank is a Fortran concept.  A C programmer will never
see, nor create, an object that has assumed rank.  If a pointer to a C
descriptor is a formal parameter, the associate actual descriptor will
not be for "assumed-rank".  Similarly, a C function cannot create an
"assumed-rank" object to be passed to another routine. If the incoming
descriptor is not for allocatable, pointer, or assumed-size objects,
then the options left for CFI_attribute_assumed are assumed-shape or a
non-allocatable, non-pointer scalar. An edit is provided to repair the
description of CFI_attribute_assumed.

EDIT to N1838:

[12:4] In 5.2.5 Macros. second sentence following Table 5.1, replace

"or an assumed-rank object that is not allocatable, a pointer, or
associated with an assumed-size argument"

with

"or a scalar that is not allocatable or a pointer."
