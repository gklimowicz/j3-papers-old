The current text of paragraph 2 in 9.5.6.1 OPEN/General grants
permission to have OPEN and other I/O statements in a BLOCK DATA
program unit. Probably not intended.

Edits to 07-007r3:

At the beginning of paragraph 2 in 9.5.6.1 OPEN/General,
[217:12-13] replace "any program unit" with 
"the main program or any subprogram" twice.
