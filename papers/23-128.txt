Subject: Normative references
Date: 2023-February-21

1. Introduction

We have three comments (**-001, **-002, **-003) complaining, incorrectly,
that some normative references are not cited normatively in the text.

Even though they are cited normatively, it is perhaps less obvious than it
could be. That is, our wording "a processor conforms to this document if"
clearly expresses requirements in plain English, but not using the proper
terms specified by ISO.

This paper suggests that we clarify this.


2. Discussion.

We are not using the word "conform" in any technical sense, just the plain
English sense where
    "A processor conforms to this document if
        [list of requirements]"
specifies requirements. So we should just use the proper ISO wording.

Following these edits, the text
  "A Fortran processor shall execute any standard-conforming program..."
makes all of the semantics specifications into requirements, without
relying on non-ISO English.


3. Edits to 23-007

[26:9] 4.2 Conformance, p2,
    "A processor conforms to this document if:"
    ->"A Fortran processor shall:".
{A non-conforming processor is simply one that does not satisfy the list
 of requirements following "shall".}

The rest of the edits are just to correct the verbal forms of the
requirements to match the "shall".
[262:10] item (1), "it executes" -> "execute".
[262:12,16,18,20,22,25,28,30,33] items (2) to 10],
        "it contains" -> "contain", nine times.
