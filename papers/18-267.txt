Subject: Syntax errors in example codes

Introduction
============

Two example codes contain syntax errors. First, in the example code in
16.9.84 ("GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE"), the instances of "LENGTH" on lines 29
and 30 should be replaced with "NAMELEN".

Second, in example C.6.8 ("Example involving failed images"):

  1.) The variable "k" is not declared, despite the presence of IMPLICIT
  NONE.
  2.) The last ELSE IF ("ELSE IF (done)") is missing a corresponding
  "THEN".

=================

[374:29-30] 16.9.84 in the example, replace the instances of "LENGTH" on
both lines with "NAMELEN", such that the full example code becomes:

  CHARACTER(:),ALLOCATABLE :: FILENAME
  INTEGER :: NAMELEN
  CALL GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE ("DATAFILE", LENGTH=NAMELEN)
  IF (NAMELEN>0) THEN
    ALLOCATE(CHARACTER(NAMELEN) :: FILENAME)
    CALL GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE("DATAFILE", FILENAME)
  END IF

[544:3] C.6.8 in the example, after "status", insert ", k", such that line
3 becomes:

  "INTEGER :: images_used, i, images_spare, status, k"

[545:6] C.6.8 in the example, after "ELSE IF (done)", insert "THEN", such
that line 6 becomes:

  "ELSE IF (done) THEN"
