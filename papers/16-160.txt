----------

Two typographical issues in Clause 15 are noted below. References are
to 16-007. These were originally in paper 16.142.


[463:17+2-3 Table 15.2] If possible, reorganize the header for the
middle column so that it occupies two lines instead of three.  If not
possible, at least move "module" onto the second line instead of leaving
"ule" so lonesome on the second line.  The continuation header on the
next page has the same problem.


[464:0+1 Table 15.2] Is it possible to get the table number into the
continuation caption?  Also tops of pages 473 and 474 for Tables 15.4
and 15.5.
