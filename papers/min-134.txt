                         by Craig T. Dedo
                        September 26, 1995

Monday, August 21, 1995
  A regular meeting was held at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, August 21, 1995 in the Peak 2 Conference
Room at the Beaver Run Resort and Conference Center, 620 Village Road, Breckenridge, CO   80424.
Jerrold Wagener was in the chair and Craig Dedo took the minutes.

1 Opening Business

1.1  X3J3 Meeting 134 Objectives
Discussion Leader:  Jerrold Wagener
 Process Public Review Comments - We need to prepare a formal answer to all formal submissions
     to ANSI.
 Prepare for the WG5 meeting to be held in November 1995 in San Diego, CA.
 Fortran 90 Interpretations - Resolve as many as time permits.
 Exception Handling Proposal - We should expect a full featured exception handling capability to
     be included in Fortran 2000.  We should start now on the development work.  This will overlap
     with John Reid's Type 2 Technical Report (TR) commissioned by WG5 and his more extensive
     full featured proposal that he is doing in addition to the TR work.
 Parameterized Derived Types - What, if anything, do we want to do about it?  Should X3J3
     develop its own proposal rather than only depend on the outcome of the TR process?  What do
     we want to do about the allocatable components part of the TR effort?
 Interoperability with C - The TR effort is floundering.  There is no permanent project editor.  Miles
     Ellis, WG5 Convenor, has temporarily assumed the role himself.  What should be our approach
     on this issue?  What do we want to do?  Should we take over this project or form a subgroup
     to do the work?

1.2  Membership Report
Discussion Leader:  Larry Rolison
ACSET declared bankruptcy recently.  It will no longer be represented on X3J3.
Current Membership:                        22
Quorum:                      8
One over half:                12

Members in Danger of Losing Membership:
  James Himer  (Exxon)
  Bill Lassaline (Lahey Computer Systems)
  Linda O'Gara (Microsoft)

1.3  Discussion on Public Relations
Discussion Leader:  none
  Should we be doing more to make X3J3 decisions and issues more accessible to the public and
interested parties?  No decisions.  Following are some ideas that were mentioned:
 Develop a Fortran Word Wide Web (WWW) page.
 Post meeting notices and other major X3J3 documents on comp.lang.fortran, the Internet Usenet
     news group for the Fortran language.
 Post announcements of major X3J3 documents on comp-fortran-90, an Internet E-mail mailing list.
 Put as many X3J3 documents as possible on the X3J3 server.
 Send press releases summarizing major decisions and issues of interest to publications in
     computer science, information systems, other sciences, engineering, and related fields.  Ivor
     Philips had such a list when he was a member of X3J3.  It included not only CS and IS
     publications but also publications in other fields that had interest in Fortran.

1.4  Adoption of the Agenda
Discussion Leader:  Jerrold Wagener
Presented as mailed with changes proposed by Jerrold Wagener (see Appendix A).

Motion:   Adopt the agenda with the changes as proposed by Jerrold Wagener.
Moved:    Stan Whitlock              Second: Craig Dedo
Action:     Passed by unanimous consent.

1.5  Appointment of Secretary
  Linda O'Gara, X3J3 Secretary, did not come to Meeting 134 and indicated by E-mail that she
would be the alternate for Microsoft instead of the primary member.  This leaves the office of
Secretary vacant.

  Craig Dedo volunteered to be Acting Secretary for Meeting 134 and Jerrold Wagener appointed
him to that position.

  Jerrold Wagener asked for volunteers for the permanent X3J3 Secretary.  Anyone who would like
the position should contact Jerrold Wagener or Larry Rolison.

1.6  Approval of the Meeting 133 Minutes
Discussion Leader:  Jerrold Wagener
Reference:  95-151
Motion:   Approve the minutes as presented.
Moved:    Janice Shepherd               Second:   Stan Whitlock

Amendments:
    2.8, p. 7, 12th Item.  The first sentence of Craig Dedo's remarks should read, "I think that
WG5 is doing this because we did not fully and fairly consider ENABLE in November."
    2.8, p. 8, 2nd Item.  The first sentence of the first quotation by Richard Maine should read,
"95-103 is issued from using papers from preceding meetings to edit 007."

Action on the Amendments:  Both passed by unanimous consent.

Action on the Main Motion as Amended:   Passed by unanimous consent.

1.7  Meeting 133 Action Items
1.             Richard Maine  Check with Bob Corbett about 95-103, item 34, and check with the Convenor
                              of WG5 to confirm or fix item 34.
               Bob Corbett's Recommendation:  Replace all references to CCIR with references
               to ISO 8601.
               Status: Done

2.             Kurt Hirchert  Add x3j3-jor alias on the X3J3 server and check that auto-unzip works on the
                              server.
                The x3j3-jor alias exists.
                Kurt Hirchert has not checked out whether the auto-unzip feature works
               yet.
               Status:   Incomplete

1.8  Treasurer's Report
Discussion Leader:  Mallory North
Reference:  95-157 for Meeting 133

1.9  X3/OMC Report
Discussion Leader:  Jerrold Wagener
Reference:  none

1.   X3 is making copies of its papers available on its World Wide Web (WWW) page.  This means that
     fewer papers will be available as hard copy.

2.   Liaison information.  Our liaison with X3H3 (Database standards) has changed.  Presley Smith
     has been our liaison to them.  He usually gets minutes and meeting notices.  We have not
     maintained our list of country liaisons.  After this meeting, Larry Rolison will contact those on the
     current list asking them if they still want to be on our list.

3.   So far, there are four official responses to the Public Review of Fortran 95.  They are from:
    IBM
    Walt Brainerd
    Layne Watson of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI)
    Alan McKenny of the Courant Institute
We also have received several unofficial public review comments.

4.   The annual report to X3 is generally presented at the X3 OMC meeting in Scottsdale, AZ in May
     1995.  Neither Jerry Wagener nor Larry Rolison could attend this meeting due to schedule
     conflicts. Jerrold Wagener will attend the September meeting in Nashua, NH.

5.   There is a concern about whether NIST will continue to validate implementations in the event that
     the ANSI FORTRAN 77 standard is withdrawn.

1.10 ISO/WG5 Report
Discussion Leader:  Jerrold Wagener
Reference:  none

1.   Each of us should have gotten a mailing from Miles Ellis, WG5 Convenor.  It includes WG5 papers
     N1125 - N1134.  All of them have been presented to SC22.

2.   Fortran 95 is expected to be ready for a DIS ballot by April 1996.  It is extremely doubtful that
     there will be a ballot before then.

3.   Revision 007r2 will incorporate all comments and part of our vote on the Fortran 95 Committee
     Draft.  A paper describes the differences between versions 007r1 and 007r2.  The version 007r1
     will still be the official Committee Draft.  After the document is officially presented to WG5, WG5
     has to take a country vote in order for there to be any further changes.  At least two countries
     must vote NO in order for the draft to go back for further review.  The WG5 document is N1124.

1.11 Comments from Members
Craig Dedo     Will there be any opportunity to discuss strategic planning for Fortran 2000
               at the November 1995 meeting in San Diego? [Answer: Yes]

               In doing strategic planning for Fortran 2000, we should not rule out any
               feature.  If we rule out certain features right away, we may rule out a feature
               which we later find is badly needed; interoperability comes to mind.  However,
               we do need to set priorities.

               I am concerned that when we need to make decisions, too often we have chosen
               to engage in corner-cutting rather than going with the more robust solution.
               I would like to see this change for Fortran 2000; we should place more
               emphasis on robustness.

               I am getting confused on all the deadlines we are facing.  Could someone
               please put together a comprehensive list?

David Levine   The world is changing but X3J3 has not adjusted to it.  We have fewer
               resources, more work to do, and there is less interest in Fortran in the world
               at large.  We are spinning our wheels.  We should move forward, be behind the
               TRs, and back existing practice.  Some existing practice may be ugly but it
               works.  From my contact with users, the user community may be more
               interested in incremental changes.

Jeanne Martin  We just received a Fortran - C interoperability proposal from Andy Meltzer
               [paper 95-199].  There also is a previously published paper on the same
               subject, "Interlanguage Communication on the NERSC CRAYs" [paper 95-200].

Walt Brainerd  I will soon be teaching Fortran 90 classes in three places: NASA, JPL, and an
               Army Research Center in Mississippi.  This last place has a very restrictive
               programming style.  They are using Fortran 90 for new projects and sticking
               strictly to the standard.

1.13 Public Review Comment Processing Procedure
  Following is the process to be used in responding to public review comments.
    Send all editorial comments to the Edit Subgroup.
    Prepare proposals for technical changes.  X3J3 must approve all technical changes in a plenary
session before they can go to the Edit Subgroup.
    Construct responses to commentors.

  There may be disagreement about why things failed.  If feasible, we should include reasons for the
failure of a feature.

  Official responses to an official, registered comment have to get a 2/3 vote.  The formal responses
to public review comments should be high quality letters.

  What about public review comments that come in after the meeting?  Should we use electronic
processing?

  Can we define the term "standard conforming" so that it is processor independent?  Should we
produce a paper on the definition of "standard conforming"?

Recess.

2 Conditional Compilation
Discussion Leader:  David Epstein
Reference:  95-178, CCF Proposed Technical Report Type 2
       95-202, Conditional Compilation Presentation

presentation and subsequent discussion.

Straw Vote: Do we favor a standardized conditional compilation facility?
          13   Favor
           0   Oppose
           3   Undecided

Recess.

3 Subgroup Reports

Edit
  By the end of the meeting, the Edit Subgroup will produce a paper containing all of this meeting's
edits and will produce electronic ASCII copies of the edits.  There will be 3 categories of items:
  1. Show-stoppers.  The US will vote NO unless we address and resolved these issues to our
     satisfaction.
  2. Technical issues which should get done but which are not show-stoppers.
  3. Purely editorial items.

  After this meeting, there will be two copies of the Fortran 95 Committee Draft, 95-007r1 and
95-007r2.  Which document do we reference?

Interpretations
  There are 26 comment items that need to be done.  The remainder are ready for WG5 or are
already approved by WG5.

  Interpretations will pull Interpretation 81 because it interacts with Interpretation 125.

  Following is a list of interpretations which the Interpretations Subgroup hopes to have ready for
a vote sometime this week.
Paper #     Interpretation
         177        125 - Procedure Arguments with the TARGET Attribute
         180        155 - Multiple USE Statements, Rename, and ONLY Lists
         181        199 - KIND Type Parameters and the DELIM= Specifier
         182        200 - Evaluation of NINT and Machine Approximations
         186        175 - What is a "Constant Specification Expression"?
         187        198 - Characteristics of Dummy Procedures
         196        83 - Extending Generic Intrinsic Procedures

  Interpretation 196 may go away; this depends on the answer that we give to Interpretation 125.

  Paper 95-184 is a status report on all of the outstanding interpretations.  It includes an
assessment of the impact each interpretation has on the language and the difficulty of finding a
successful resolution.  There are 26 interpretations on the list.  If we pass all seven, the number of
outstanding interpretations will drop to 19.

JOR
  Following is a list of papers that JOR will be considering.
191 - List of all items from LLNL for Fortran 95 and Fortran 2000
178 - CCF Proposed Technical Report Type 2
179 - David Levine's Comments on CCF Proposal
185 - Lawrence Ruby's Proposal for Standardizing Behavior of Uninitialized Variables in Fortran 2000
189 - Janice Shepherd's Proposal for an Annex of Processor Dependent Items
193 - High Performance Fortran Forum (HPFF) Recommendations on Fortran 2000

  JOR will be developing recommendations for items in the JOR and will attempt to set priorities
on items as either High, Medium, or Low.  JOR may propose archiving some things.

Parallel
  Parallel is looking at 4 papers and spent some time on ENABLE.  John Reid is moving fast on it;
he considers ENABLE a top priority.

OOF
  OOF will try to answer all of the IBM comments by tomorrow.

4 End of Day Comments from Members
Stan Whitlock  I have a sense of foreboding.  It is more important to get the comments and
               interpretations done.  Will strategic planning get short shrift?

Richard Maine  When we are done with reviewing the JOR and setting priorities for Fortran
               2000, will it make coherent sense?  We need a final wrap-up stage.

Jerrold Wagener  How do we achieve a coherent wrap-up?

David Levine   Each subgroup will prepare responses to the public review comments.  What
               does the full committee do?

Jerrold Wagener  I expect X3J3 to vote on the responses.

Recess at 5:56 p.m. until 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, August 22, 1995.

Tuesday, August 22, 1995
Call to order at 8:30 a.m.

5 ENABLE Proposal
Parallel
Discussion Leader:  Dick Hendrickson
Reference:  95-192, Enable Technical Report
       95-212, ENABLE Discussion

  John Reid is running a very open process.  Although the TR charter is to develop an exception
handling capability only for floating point conditions, John is also doing a larger scope proposal which
will handle many other conditions.

  The latest version of ENABLE takes a new approach.  This version treats conditions as variables
in a module.  Following are additional features:
 A programmer has to USE CONDITIONS module in order to set conditions.
 The module allows comparisons against default integer zero and against a named constant
  (PARAMETER) defined as QUIET.
 A programmer can define additional exceptions.
 There are still SIGNAL and HANDLE statements.

  What happens in PURE procedures?  PURE procedures cannot set variables inside modules.  In
a PURE procedure, the processor acts as if there were an initial ENABLE statement at the beginning.
If a condition is signaling at the beginning, there will be an immediate return.  If there is entry into
a PURE procedure beyond the beginning, it is as if there is a local copy of the condition variables.
This model allows any instance of PURE procedures to signal conditions without affecting any other
instances.  If a condition is signaling at the end, the condition is copied to a global copy of the
condition.  This means that the CONDITIONS module would have properties different from all other
modules.

  This model fits in well with ordinary Fortran.  If a variable goes out of scope, e.g., a procedure
with USE CONDITIONS returns to a procedure without USE CONDITIONS, the processor issues a
warning message.  How does a processor know if a variable goes out of scope?

  What do we tell John Reid?  Do we want more clarification?

  Extensive discussion on ENABLE (not recorded here).  Result: X3J3 wants the Parallel Subgroup
to consider the discussion and bring back a recommendation on how to act on this issue.

6 Subgroup Reports

OOF
  There is nothing to report.

JOR
  Papers 95-204 and 95-205 are ready for reading.

  How do we fix the wording for KIND=?

  Many users mistakenly believe that obsolescent means that features will disappear immediately
instead of in a future version of the standard.

8 Discussion on Minor Feature Requests
Discussion Leader:  none

Jerrold Wagener  What do we do about the comments of the nature of, "It would be really nice
                 if we would add this one minor feature that no one would object to and the cost
                 is not great"?  Is it appropriate to bring these items forward?

Kurt Hirchert  There should be a process for minor features and enhancements.  It really
               bothers me that we never spend time on these issues.  We always spend lots
               of time on these big, complex, and costly features, but never on the small stuff.
               They seem to slip through the cracks.  We need to make time for considering
               minor enhancements.

David Levine   This is like the shipment of any product.  In most companies, final
               pre-shipment activity is carefully monitored to ensure holding to the release
               schedule.  Work is limited to achieving stability and removing known defects.
               Any last minute additions ("features") will just have to wait for the next
               release.

David Epstein  We should treat this as any software company shipping a software product.
               There is no way a feature will creep into a software product after spending
               90% of the testing time.  So, no, we do not want to add an item after (during)
               testing mode.

Keith Bierman  It's obvious that the process is broken.  WG5 wants to ship the product this
               fall.  That means that the public comment really does not mean anything.  We
               need to allocate the time to consider all public comments if we are serious
               about what they have to say.

Craig Dedo     At the very least, we should put out a report on what our response is to each
               of the public review comments.  In the future, we should fix the process in
               order to make sure that there is time at the table for minor feature requests.

9 Fortran 2000 Requirements and Process
Discussion Leader:  Jerrold Wagener
Reference:  none

  To what extent should the following strategic objectives influence Fortran 2000 requirements?
  High Performance
  Object Oriented
  Windows Support
  General Purpose Programming
  Programmer Productivity
  User Demand
  Other objectives that various members of X3J3 might consider important

  One possible way to start the process would be to weight each proposed feature on how well it
achieves each strategic objective.  We could construct a table like the following.  In each cell we would
score how each feature contributes to the achievement of each strategic objective.  By adding up the
scores of each cell, we could get a weighted score of each feature's importance.



Objective 1
Objective 2
Objective 3

Objective n


Feature 1







Feature 2







Feature 3















Feature n







Kurt Hirchert  In our experience, we have only focused on the large merit and large cost
               features.  We need to have some way of including the low cost features.

Jeanne Martin  I feel a real sense of urgency.  We need to have something to present to WG5
               in November.  We need to have a whole report.

David Epstein  We really need to look at this from a business perspective. Any private firm in
               our position would be asking why our last release did not sell very well.
               Fortran is dwindling in general appeal and there must be reasons for that.  We
               can be flexible on the date when the next Fortran release ships.  Could we
               have a Fortran 98?  We should not set a ship date before we know what we are
               doing.  We should keep this point in mind: What are the reasons that Fortran
               is not selling?

Dick Hendrickson With the time that we have available, we can only get a rough triage.

Keith Bierman  We should keep the slides and present them to the WG5 meeting.  We are not
               answering the big question: What is our principal thrust?

Stan Whitlock  We need to come up with a list of suggested requirements for WG5.  Some
               items in the JOR have overlap.  Right now, the only planning tool we have is
               the JOR.  There are a lot of little features that are not in the JOR.

Richard Maine  We should be aware of not only the benefit but also the cost.

Recess at 12:00 noon until 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, August 23.

17   Proposed Features for Fortran 2000

17.1 Discussion on Asynchronous I/O
Reference:  95-235, Asynch I/O
       95-241, JOR Item on Asynchronous I/O
Discussion Leader:  Craig Dedo
Following are the major points covered in the discussion.
 Make sure that after the I/O operation is started, that nothing uses the variable in any way until
     the I/O operation is completed.
 Be careful about pointer associations that involve variables in the asynchronous I/O list.
 Under what conditions does a variable in an asynchronous I/O operation become undefined?
 What happens to the variables in the I/O list if the asynchronous I/O operation does not return?
 Should we allow multiple I/O operations to be outstanding on the same unit at the same time?
 What operating system dependencies will we encounter?
 We need to accommodate operating systems and hardware that do not support asynchronous I/O.
 The work that HPFF has been doing in this area is very important.  We need to coordinate our
     work with theirs.  Make sure that there is full two-way communication and very few
     misunderstandings.
 Be sure to follow the standard model for developing new features.  The developer should go
     through these steps.
     1.   A statement of the requirement.
     2.   A survey of existing implementations.
     3.   Tutorials on the feature.  Good tutorials are extremely important.  A proposal without
          them will go nowhere.
     4.   Outline of a proposal.
     5.   Straw votes.
     6.   A detailed proposal.
 Be sure to know how to handle interactions with END=, ERR=, and NAMELIST.
 Interactions with exception handling.  Work closely with John Reid on this, but don't expect him
     to take over the work.

17.2 TR on Allocatable Components
  Jerrold Wagener asked if there were any volunteers who were willing to work with Dr. Lawrie
Schonfelder of the University of Liverpool on this.  David Epstein and Jeanne Martin volunteered to
work with Dr. Schonfelder and participate in the work.  Kurt Hirchert volunteered to be an observer.

17.3 Interoperability
  Jerrold Wagener expressed some concerns about the state of the Interoperability TR project.  Right
now, we do not have a permanent project editor.  Miles Ellis, the WG5 Convenor, is the temporary
project editor.  The three members of the Interoperability Subgroup, Linda O'Gara, Graham Barber,
and Henry Zongaro, are not at this meeting.  One thing that we are sure of is that this is a very high
priority for WG5.
  There was some discussion about possible project editors.  An American project editor would not
have to be a member of X3J3.  It is possible that more than one person from the same organization
could be on the project team.  Richard Maine and Keith Bierman volunteered to be observers on the
project team.

18.2 Future Meetings
See also Appendix C.
Meeting 135 is November 13-17, 1995 in San Diego, CA.

Originally, there were only 3 meetings scheduled for 1996, due to potential conflicts with the
Fortran 95 DIS ballot.  However, we are uncertain when the DIS ballot period will be.

Motion:   Have a regular 4 meeting schedule in 1996, with the following tentative dates:
                 136  February 12-16
                 137  May 13-17

Moved:    Jerrold Wagener            Second: Larry Rolison
Action:     Passed by unanimous consent

  There was some discussion about possible meeting places for the 1996 meetings but nothing was
decided.

18.3 Treasurer's Report
Discussion Leader:  Mallory North
Reference:  95-248

  In the opinion of Mallory North, Laser Graphics, which was our reproduction service for this
meeting, did an outstanding job.  Larry Rolison volunteered to buy them a potted plant and write them
a very nice thank you letter.

18.4 Funding the WG5 Meeting
  The ISO requires the host delegation to finance the expenses of the WG5 meeting.  In most other
countries, either the host country's government or corporate sponsors pay the costs.  Both of these
options are not available to us.  Due to ANSI rules, we cannot use money in the X3J3 treasury to pay
the cost of the WG5 meeting.  We would like to keep the total cost for each member at $100.

Motion:   Waive the regular $100 meeting fee for Meeting 135 only; it goes back to $100 for
            subsequent meetings.  Assess a $100 meeting fee for the WG5 meeting.
Moved:    Walt Brainerd              Second: Larry Rolison
Action:     Passed by unanimous consent

18.5 Review of Action Items
1.             Kurt Hirchert  Check out whether the auto-unzip feature on the X3J3 server works yet.

2.             Craig Dedo  Send a copy of X3J3 and US TAG minutes to Jerrold Wagener for his review
                           prior to sending them to the X3J3 Mailing List or to Kurt Hirchert for
                           inclusion in the post-meeting mailing.

3.             Larry Rolison  Did the interpretations at the Tokyo WG5 meeting pass the WG5 ballot?

4.             Craig Dedo  Check with Ivor Philips to see whether he still has the list of publications that
                           he sent information and press releases to.

Walt Brainerd  What work should we farm out to JOR and other subgroups?

               We still need a home page on the World Wide Web (WWW).  I will be happy
               to do the work.

  The meeting adjourned at 3:37 p.m.
