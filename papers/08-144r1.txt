Subject: Statement functions in BLOCK constructs?
Date: 2008 May 11

1.  Introduction

We did not intend to allow statement function statements in BLOCK
constructs

2.  Edits:

[171:8.1.4 C806] -----------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "or" by a comma.  Insert ", or statement function"
after "OPTIONAL".
