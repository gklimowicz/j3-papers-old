1. Edits
--------

[35:4+2 NOTE 5.1] Replace "R2" with "R5", preferably using \label on the
clause heading and \ref here.

[38:25 5.2.1p2] Replace "contains definitions" with "can contain
definitions and declarations".  {It isn't necessary for it to contain
either one, and it can contain declarations.}

[39:5 5.2.4p1] Replace "contains" with "can contain"; after
"definitions" insert "and declarations".

[39:6 5.2.4p1] Delete "definitions".

[40:19-20 5.3.4p1] Delete "The image index that identifies an image is
an integer value in the range one to the number of images." {Because
it's false within a CHANGE TEAM construct.}

[41:4+ 5.3.4p2+] Insert a new paragraph:

"The image index that identifies an image is an integer value in the
range one to the number of images in the team."

[41:15-16 5.3.5p2] After "invoked" insert "or a BLOCK (11.1.4) begins
execution".  Replace "the" with "its".  Delete "of the invoked
procedure".

[41:18 5.3.5p2] After "entry point" insert ", or of the <block> of the
BLOCK construct, respectively".

[41:26 5.3.5p2(3)] Delete the list item "A Block ... this construct."
{Because it doesn't say that expressions within the <specification-part>
are evaluated in processor-dependent order.}

[43:5 5.4.1.2p1] After "derived types" insert "may have components and
type-bound procedures, and".

[43:33 5.4.3.2p5(3)] Before "complex object" insert "scalar or array"
for consistency with the other list items.

[43:35 5.4.3.2.1p1] After "and redefined" insert ",or become undefined".

[44:20-21 5.4.4p1] Replace "does ... undefined" with "undefined it does
not have a predictable value".  {The cause-and-effect relationship is
backward here because we don't specify events in Clause 19 that cause
variables to have unpredictable values; rather, we specify events that
cause their values to become undefined.}

[44:23 5.4.4p2] Replace "not ... undefined" with "is undefined its
pointer association status is not predictable".   {The cause-and-effect
relationship is backward here because we don't specify events in Clause
19 that cause pointers to have unpredictable association status; rather,
we specify events that cause their association status to become
undefined.}

[47:17+3 NOTE 5.13] After "facilitates" insert "program modification,
and".

[48:8+5 NOTE 5.124] Replace "For example, a" with "A" because this isn't
an example of anything described in the previous paragraph.

2. Questions without edits
--------------------------

[42:9 5.3.7p1] Should "all images" be "all nonfailed images"?

I don't know if this is precisely correct, but the existing text does
not contemplate the possibility that a corresponding coarray might exist
on an image that is not a member of the same team:

[45:24-25 5.4.7p2] Replace "corresponding coarray with" by ", and there
may be corresponding coarrays on images that are not members of the same
team.  Each corresponding coarray has".  Replace "that is in the same
team" with "on which it exists".
