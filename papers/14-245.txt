1. Introduction
===============

By enumerating the attributes of associating entities, we missed some,
e.g., at least PROTECTED.

2. Edits
========

[173:32-33 8.3.3.2p1] Delete "The associating ... polymorphic."

[173:34 8.3.3.2p2] Delete the paragraph; all attributes are now either
described under the rubric "Attributes of associate names," or a
reference is given there.

[173:2-8 8.1.3.3p1] Replace the paragraph with

"Within an ASSOCIATE or SELECT TYPE construct, each associating entity
has the same attributes as the associated selector, with the following
exceptions:

  o  within an ASSOCIATE construct, the associating entity is
     polymorphic if and only if the selector is polymorphic,
  o  whether the associating entity in a SELECT TYPE construct is
     polymorphic is specified in 8.1.9.2,
  o  the associating entity does not have the OPTIONAL, POINTER, or
     ALLOCATABLE attribute, and
  o  if the selector has the POINTER attribute, the associating entity
     has the TARGET attribute."

{This covers rank, corank, declared type, polymorphism, kind type
parameters and their values, length type parameters, INTENT, PROTECTED,
TARGET, ASYNCHRONOUS, VOLATILE, ..., but not bounds, cobounds, dynamic
type, or length type parameter values.}

"The bounds of each dimension of the associating entity are [the same
as?] those of the selector.  The cobounds of each codimension of the
associating entity are [the same as?] those of the selector.  The length
type parameter values of the associating entity are [the same as?] those
of the selector.  If the selector is a pointer it shall be associated
with a target and the associating entity is that target.  If the
selector is allocatable it shall be allocated.  If the associating
entity is polymorphic, it assumes the dynamic type, type parameters, and
type parameter values of the selector.  If the selector has the OPTIONAL
argument it shall be present.  The associating entity is contiguous if
and only if the selector is contiguous."

{The first sentence of the above paragraph is different from the
original.  If it is defective, then so is the second, which was copied
verbatim from 8.1.3.3p1.  In the antepenultimate sentence, the phrase
"type parameter values" has been added to the original one from
8.1.3.3p1.  The last two sentences are copied verbatim from 8.1.3.3p1,
in the same order they appear there.}

{The sentences
"The length type parameter values of the associating entity are those of
the selector.  If the selector is a pointer it shall be associated with
a target and the associating entity is that target.  If the selector is
allocatable it shall be allocated."
are new.  Should this be the subject of an interpretation?}

{The deleted sentences concerning ASYNCHRONOUS, VOLATILE, and TARGET
attributes said "if and only if the selector is a variable and has the
attribute," which boils down to "if and only if TRUE and the selector
has the attribute," because the syntax admits only variables.}
