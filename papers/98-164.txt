NUMBER: 28
TITLE: Implicitly Typed Statement Function Character Dummy
KEYWORDS: statement function, constant expression, implicit typing
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following program-unit standard-conforming?

SUBROUTINE sub(n)
  IMPLICIT CHARACTER*(n) (c)
  stmtfn(ch) = LEN(ch)
END

A quick survey of 6 compilers showed no consensus on whether this was legal,
with 3 accepting it (as standard-conforming), 2 rejecting it, and 1 crashing
with an internal error.

ANSWER: No.

DISCUSSION:
[51:32-33] requires explicitly-specified character lengths for statement
functions and statement function dummy arguments to be constant specification
expressions.  This requirement should also be applied to implicitly typed
entities.

EDIT:

[211:35+] Add new paragraph
"If a statement function or statement function dummy argument is implicitly
typed and is of type character, its corresponding character length
specification (if any) shall be a constant specification expression."
