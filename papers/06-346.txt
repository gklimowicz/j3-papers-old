At meeting 177 only the "Simple editorial corrections" sections of
06-210r2 were processed. Here I resubmit:
1) Requests to clarify or change wording
2) Technical issues

Changes of wording
_________________________________

[117:1] We should change the term "structure component" since it
can be read to mean "component of a structure" rather than being
a made-up term. A structure is scalar, but "structure component"
can be an array. I find this very weird and confusing. Maybe
"object component".

[117:10] We need an equivalent to C614 for the <image-selector>. At
present this seems to be a plain restriction (non constraint) at
[124:5].

[126:30] Shouldn't we add "as if via intrinsic assignment" or something
alike to the end of the paragraph. The current phrasing "the value of
<allocate-object> becomes that of <source-expr>" does not seem to make
sense for the case when <source-expr> is scalar and <allocate-object>
an array.

Technical questions

[120:11] We had an e-mail discussion about the "does not require the
shape". A subroutine reference such as:
CALL Subroutine(assumed_size_dummy%component)
does not "require" the shape of assumed_size, yet we want to
prohibit it. We seemed to agree that the wording should be improved.
