Discussion:
-----------

Ballot Comment 53 from the UK observed for the <procedure-designator>
form <data-ref> % <binding-name> in R1522, the effect of C1528

C1528 (R1522) A <data-ref> shall not be a polymorphic subobject of a
coindexed object.

is to allow a <data-ref> of the form

    coarray[1]%pointer%allocpoly

but not to allow a <data-ref> of the form

    coarray[1]%allocatable%allocpoly.

We believe that it was intended to disallow both.

The term "coindexed object" is defined (3.30) as "data object whose
designator includes an image selector".  Since "includes" covers an
image selector on any part-ref, deleting "subobject of a" from the
constraint should cover both cases.


Edit to N2137:
--------------

[313:20] In 15.5.1 Syntax of a procedure reference, p1, in constraint
C1528, delete "subobject of a".

{Resulting constraint reads:

C1528 (R1522) A <data-ref> shall not be a polymorphic coindexed object.}
