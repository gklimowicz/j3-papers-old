Subject: BNF Analysis

I've written a short perl script to extract and analyze BNF rules and
constraints from the text version of the 007 document.  The full output
of this script is about 3700 lines long, of which about 1750 are the BNF,
about 1250 are the constraints, about the 500 are the cross-reference of
non-terminal symbols, and about 200 are the cross-reference of alphabetic
terminal symbols.  An extra level of analysis identified the following
non-terminal symbols as ones that are either defined and never referenced
elsewhere in the BNF or referenced and never defined:

char-variable		R605	-
character		R301	-
digit			-	R302,R313,R402,R408,R409,R411,R850
letter			-	R302,R304,R550,R703,R723
local-defined-operator	-	R1110
logical-variable	R603	-
program			R201	-
rep-char		-	R420
scalar-constant-subobject	-	R547
scalar-default-char-initialization-expr	-	R913
scalar-int-constant-subobject	-	R546
special-character	-	R301
use-defined-operator	-	R1110
wait-stmt		R920	-

If anyone would like the script itself or some other level of its output
(e.g., the complete non-terminal cross-reference), I would be happy to
give it to you.
