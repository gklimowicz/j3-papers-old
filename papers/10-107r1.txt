DISCUSSION

FCD comment GB-3 requested that the arithmetic IF statement be deleted
from F2008.  WG5 agreed that it should not be deleted but should be
prohibited.

10-107 pointed out that these edits should also be made:

   8.2.4: Define the meaning as that of the equivalent IF construct.
   1.7.1: Correct the words that refer to vertical format control.
   [4:39] "arithmetic IF statement,"  should be in tiny font.


EDITS

[4:39] In 1.3.18, set "arithmetic IF statement," in tiny font.

[25:1] In 1.7.1p1, change "five" to "six" .

[187:4+] Append the following sentence to 8.2.4p1:
  "The value of the numeric expression shall not be a NaN." .
