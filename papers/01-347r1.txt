The ; is not part of the statement it terminates.

Edits: (to 01-007R4)

[28:9] after 'comment. ' add 'The ";" is not part of the statement. '

[29:22] after '6. ' add 'The ";" is not part of the statement. '

>4)  Page 28[2+], 3.3.1.1.  We don't appear to cover a line like
>       a = 3;
>nothing is said about what follows the ;  Is it commentary?  or what?
>same thing applies to 3.3.2.1 for fixed form

Non-blank text following the ";" on the same line is either a comment
(if the first character is "!"), a new statement (if the first
character is not "!" or ";"), or an ignored sequence of blank and ";"
characters.   If all of the characters on the line which
follow the ";" are blanks they are ignored.  No edits seem needed for
this issue.
