Subject: Interpretation Request on Elemental Procedures

NUMBER:
TITLE: ELEMENTAL procedures with no arguments
KEYWORDS: Elemental, procedure
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS:

Section 12.7.2 of IS 1539-1:1997 seems to assume there is at least one
argument to an elemental procedure.  The semantics of the following
examples do not seem to be clearly specified.

Example 1:
      ELEMENTAL INTEGER FUNCTION f()
        f = 0
      END

Example 2:
      ELEMENTAL INTEGER FUNCTION g(i)
        INTEGER,INTENT(IN) :: i
        g = i
      END

Example 3:
      ELEMENTAL INTEGER FUNCTION h(i,j)
        INTEGER,INTENT(IN) :: i,j
        OPTIONAL j
        h = i/j
      END
      ...
      SUBROUTINE S(JARG)
        INTEGER IARG,JARG(3)
        OPTIONAL JARG
        ...
        ... H(IARG)
        ... H(IARG,JARG)

Example 4:
      ELEMENTAL INTEGER FUNCTION h2(i)
        INTEGER,INTENT(IN),OPTIONAL :: i
        h = i
      END

Example 5:
      ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE s()
        REAL x,y,z
        x = 0
        y = 0
        z = x/y
      END

QUESTION 1:
What is the shape of a reference to function F in example 1?
Is it scalar or a zero-sized array (and of what dimension)?

QUESTION 2:
If G() is referenced with a zero-sized array argument, there
are no elements corresponding to I in "G = I".  Is this ok?
Does the reference to I take place?

QUESTION 3:
In the reference H(IARG), the J argument is not present and so the shape
of the reference is that of IARG, i.e. scalar.
In the reference H(IARG,JARG), what is the shape if, at runtime, JARG is
not present [in the call to S]?

QUESTION 4:
What is the shape of a reference to H2() if the argument is textually
not present?

QUESTION 5:
Is this example standard-conforming, or may a processor raise a
divide-by-zero exception, even though there is no array argument
over which to iterate a call?
