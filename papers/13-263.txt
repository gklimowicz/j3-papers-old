----------

We suggest here some minor edits that have come to our attention in
the course of work on N1967.

Edits to N1967:
---------------

[10:3+] Add new paragraph
"The appearance of <sync-stat-list> on a CHANGE TEAM statement is
treated as an appearance both there and in the corresponding
END TEAM statement."
Reason: This is currently "buried" in 8.5 (27:22-23).

[33:5-11]. Replace the displayed code by
      subroutine codot(x,y,x_dot_y)
         real :: x[*],y[*],x_dot_y
         x_dot_y = x*y
         call co_sum(x_dot_y)
      end subroutine codot
Reason: Simpler and does what the text on lines 3-4 promises.

[33:21]. Replace the statement involving merge by
       if (j==j_max) then
          j_max_location = this_image()
       else
          j_max_location = 0
       end if
Reason: the use of merge obscures the meaning.
