Discussion - Responses with edits
---------------------------------

{Van 16}: At [15:3-4] lines are wider than the margins. This needs to
be fixed in the LaTeX sources.

{Van 32}: At [21:7] The KIND of the COUNT argument in EVENT_QUERY
should only require that it can hold any default integer value.

{Dan 8}: For status values at [21:10-12] change from zero/nonzero to
positive. These are errors, so positive is appropriate.

{Ed}: In the discussion of EVENT_QUERY the phrases "invocation is
successful/unsuccessful" are not consistent with usage elsewhere.
Response: Change to refer to error conditions. Edits are provided.

{Ed}: Instead of writing an argument "becomes defined with" or "is
given the value", instead write "is assigned the value".

------------------------------------

{Nick 12}: 7.4.11 p21 It needs to say that EVENT_QUERY may be used in
segments that are unordered with respect to EVENT POST on the same
variable.
Response: The segment ordering rules say nothing of EVENT_QUERY, so we
see no need for this. Note 7.1 makes it clear that EVENT_QUERY does
not imply any synchronization.

{Reinhold, A.2.4}: In THIS_IMAGE can the coarray argument and DISTANCE
argument both be supplied?
Response:  No. The syntax at [31:2] does not allow this.

[21:7-8] {Ed} Change "the invocation is successful" to "no error
condition occurs".

[21:8-9] {Ed} In the COUNT description change "COUNT becomes defined
