----------

The restriction in F2008 13.5 at 330:1-3 in 15-007r1 reads

"The effects of calling COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE ,
GET_COMMAND, and GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT on any image other than image
1 are processor dependent."

With the introduction of teams, the ambiguity would apply to images
other than image 1 of the initial team, leaving some teams with no
access at all. Additionally, the limitations for COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT,
GET_COMMAND, and GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT contradict the current
descriptions of the routines.

Edits to 15-007r1
-----------------

[xviii] In the Introduction, para 2, in the block beginning "Intrinsic
        procedures and modules:", append the sentence "The effect of
        calling COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, GET_COMMAND, and
        GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, on imagess other than image one, is no
        longer processor dependent."

[330:1-2 13.6p3] Delete "COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT," and " , GET_COMMAND,
and GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT,".
