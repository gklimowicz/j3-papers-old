Subject: Unresolved issue 331

1. Introduction

Issue 331 says that the text on [254:38-255:2] about resolving generic type-
bound procedure references is confusing.

An edit is supplied to replace this text with marginally less confusing
text.

We'll introduce some helper terms for the description of it.  Assuming we
only use them here (and immediately after the definition), there will be no
need to insert them into the glossary or index.

Note that the edit below also replaces the text about non-generic tbp
references as well.

2. Edits to 01-007r1

[254:35-255:2] Replace with
"For type-bound procedure references, the binding in the declared type of
the
 <data-ref> whose name is <binding-name> is the <<declared binding>>, and
the
 binding in the dynamic type of the <data-ref> with that name is the
<<dynamic
 binding>>.

 If the declared binding is nongeneric, the dynamic binding shall not be
 deferred; the procedure identified by the dynamic binding is referenced.

 If the declared binding is generic, then
 (1) If the reference is consistent with one of the specific interfaces in
the
     declared binding, the corresponding specific interface in the dynamic
     binding is selected.
 (2) Otherwise, the reference shall be consistent with an elemental
reference
     to one of the specific interfaces in the declared binding; the
     corresponding specific interface in the dynamic binding is selected.
 The selected specific interface shall not be deferred; the reference is to
the
 procedure identified by that interface."
