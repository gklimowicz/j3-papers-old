Standard C uses the term 'integer constant' with at least three
different meanings, and (usually) specifies which one is meant.  The TR
needs to do the same.  The best analogy is in C99 5.2.4.2.1 <limits.h>.


Edits to 10-165r2:

[10:22] "integer constant expression" should be replaced by "integer
constant expression suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives."
