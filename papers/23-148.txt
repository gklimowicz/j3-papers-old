From: Tom Clune & subgroup generics
Subject: Thoughts on additional generics features
Date: 2023-February-23


1. Introduction
---------------

This paper provides a rough summary additional generics capabilities
that the generics subgroup hopes to introduce in F202y in roughly the
order of decreasing priority (within each section).  Completing syntax
and edits for the currently approved set of generics features remains
the top priority, of course.

2. Further support for containers
---------------------------------

While the currently passed features for generics go a long way toward
enabling user-defined containers, several supplemental capabilities
would significantly improve their usage.

- canonical mechanisms for looping/iterating over items in a container
- enable elemental procedures to act on containers
- enable other analogs of array features such as slices
- enable analogs of pack, reduce, etc.
