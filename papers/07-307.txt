Subject: Co-arrays should not be interoperable

Discussion

In London, see 07-276r1, we decided that we needed to specify that
interfaces with a co-array dummy argument are not interoperable.
The editor did not accept the edit because he thinks that no co-array
should be interoperable. We agree. In particular, we overlooked the fact
that the desire to store co-arrays in a symmetric heap might be in
conflict with C's rules for storage of global variables. Furthermore,
there is some sentiment within WG5 that the co-array feature should be
reduced. This will make a small reduction and the restriction could be
relaxed in a later revision.
