Subject: Interp: Implicit type in BLOCK construct

NUMBER: F08/0074
TITLE: Implicit type in BLOCK construct
KEYWORDS: IMPLICIT, BLOCK
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

  Program m198_1
    Implicit Complex(a-z)
    Logical x
    x = .True.
    Block
      Dimension x(2)
      x = 3
      Print *,x
    End Block
  End Program

Is this standard-conforming, and if so, what is the type of the X
inside the BLOCK construct?

The Fortran 2008 standard specifies the implicit mapping in program
units, interface bodies, internal procedures, and module procedures,
at 5.5p3, but does not specify the implicit mapping in a BLOCK
construct.

ANSWER:

This was intended to be standard-conforming; the type is COMPLEX.
An edit is provided to remedy this omission.

EDIT:

[109:16] In 5.5p3, last sentence,
         After "and the default for"
         change "an internal or module procedure"
         to "a BLOCK construct, internal subprogram, or module
         subprogram".

This makes the whole sentence read
  "If a mapping is not specified for a letter, the default for a
   program unit or an interface body is default integer if the letter
   is I, J, ..., or N and default real otherwise, and the default for
   a BLOCK construct, internal subprogram, or module subprogram, is
   the mapping in the host scoping unit."
