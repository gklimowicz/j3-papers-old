To:         J3
From:       Craig Dedo
Date:       August 13, 2002
Subject:    Alphabetize the PENDING= Specifier in the INQUIRE
Statement

Rationale
    Readers of the Fortran 2000 Standard would be surprised to find
    the PENDING= specifier out of the usual alphabetical order in
    the explanation of specifiers for the INQUIRE statement.

Edits
    Edits refer to the 02-007r2 draft of Fortran 2000.

[212:36]    Insert "(9.9.1.18a)" after "ID= specifier".

[214:13+]   Add a new section title, "9.9.1.18a PENDING= specifier
in the INQUIRE statement".

[212:33 213:8 ] Move the text of section 9.9.1.12, including the
first edit above, to the new section at [214:13+].

[212:32]    Rename section 9.9.1.12 and insert new text as follows:
    9.9.1.12    ID= specifier in the INQUIRE statement
    The value of the variable specified in the ID= specifier shall
    be the identifier of a pending data transfer operation for the
    specified unit.  Also see the PENDING= specifier (9.9.1.18a).
