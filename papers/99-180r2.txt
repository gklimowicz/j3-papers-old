Subject: Improve definition of the ALLOCATABLE attribute
From: Van Snyder

1. Introduction

The sentence "The <<ALLOCATABLE attribute>> may be specified for an object" at
82:24 has almost no information content.  The paragraph also mistakenly has
"shape" instead of bounds - and this is redundant since 5.1.2.4.3
"deferred-shape array" covers this.

Also, the text in 5.1.2.4.3 redundantly and incorrectly specifes how space may
be allocated for an allocatable array (it omits derived-type intrinsic
assigment).

Also, the glossary entry for "allocatable variable" is incorrect on two
counts: it refers to the wrong section, and there is no term "allocatable
variable" defined anywhere in the standard.

2. Edits

[79:38-39] Replace "by execution of ... (6.4.1)" by "(5.1.2.9)".

[82:24-25] Replace the first sentence with
	   "An object with the <<ALLOCATABLE attribute>> is one for which
	   space is allocated by an ALLOCATE statement (6.4.1) or by a
	   derived-type intrinsic assignment statement (7.5.1.5).".

[82:25-26] Delete "; the shape ... (6.4.1)".

[414:35] Change "(5.1.2.4.3)" to "(5.1.2.9)".
