In 13.7.52 eoshift, there's a table listing the default
values of boundary, including the one for the bits type.
This should be removed.

I'd be happy with this in 008 unless someone wants
to declare a disaster, and treat it as an Interp.

Edits:

{Editor, remove the zombie type from the table at [344:13-14]}

[344:13-14] delete he line "bits  B'0'"
