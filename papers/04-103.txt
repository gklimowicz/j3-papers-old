Subject: Relational Operators for Unordered Reals

I propose to add operators to the ieee_arithmetic intrinsic module
to compare two ieee reals and return true if they are unordered
(that is, if one or both is/are NaN(s)).

Title: Unordered Operator

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: Section 14

Basic Functionality: Operators .un. and <> return true
                     if their ieee real operands are unordered
                     and return false otherwise.

Rationale:  These operators are described in ieee 754
            and are easily implemented (as a wrapper
            to ieee_unordered, for example).

Estimated Impact: No other feature is affected.

Detailed Specification: Supply .un. and <> as operators
         in the ieee_arithmetic intrinsic module (where
         ieee_unordered() resides).  This completes the set
         of relational operators applicable to ieee 754
         quantities.

         I believe this may be done with nothing more than
         an interface block.
