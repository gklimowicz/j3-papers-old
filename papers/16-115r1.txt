1. Discussion
   ----------

The r0 of this paper surmised
    In 6.3 Constants, we say "redefinition of a constant is never
    permitted".  I suspect we mean that redefinition of a named constant
   is never permitted, since those are the only constants that have a
   definition mechanism.

However, this overlooks the possibility of
   CALL sub(2.0)
   ...
   SUBROUTINE sub(x)
   x = 1.0
   END
So there really is a point to this prohibition.

The r0 of this paper said
    In 6.7.1.3 Allocation of allocatable variables, there are two
    instances where we say that the ALLOCATED function "returns" a
    value. Elsewhere in the standard we tend to say that functions have a
    certain "result", rather than using the "returns" terminology.

Agreed.

[133:7-8] In 6.7.1.3 Allocation of allocatable variables, in the first
bullet item, change the last paragraph "The intrinsic function
ALLOCATED (13.8.11) returns true for such a variable." to "The result
of the intrinsic function ALLOCATED (13.8.11) is true for such a
variable."

[133:14-15] In 6.7.1.3 Allocation of allocatable variables, in the
second bullet item, change the last paragraph "The intrinsic function
ALLOCATED (13.8.11) returns false for such a variable." to "The result
of the intrinsic function ALLOCATED (13.8.11) is false for such a
variable."
