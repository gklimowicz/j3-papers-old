     [Editor: Insert a new UTI:]                                                                                 488:23
          J3 internal note
          Unresolved Technical Issue xxx
          Why does the text concerning external procedure name etc. before the list, and that concerning
          derived types etc. after the list, use "inaccessible by that name", while the text immediately after
          the list, that applies to the list, uses "inaccessble by that name by host association"?. If they
          really should all be the same, make them so, add "a type-name in a derived-type-stmt " to the list,
          and delete discussion of derived types from the paragaph after the list.
