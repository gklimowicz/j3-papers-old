KEYWORDS: generic, type-bound
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: Section 12.4.5 discusses how a <binding-name>
in a <procedure-designator> (R1219) is resolved if the <binding-name>
is that of a generic type-bound procedure.  This seems to imply
that it is intended to be possible to invoke a generic type-bound
procedure (which one might have guessed anyway :-)).

However, according to the bnf in 4.5.4, only a specific binding has a
<binding-name>.  The <binding-name-list> in <generic-binding> is a
list of specific binding names.  Thus the discussion of generic
<binding-name>s in 12.4.5 is moot, there being no such things.

Consequently, R1219 appears to provide no syntax for invoking
generic type-bound procedures.

Should R1219 and 12.4.5 be modified to allow a reference of the
form "<data-ref> % <generic-name>" where <generic-name> is
the name of a generic binding of the declared type of <data-ref>?

ANSWER:

Yes.  Edits are provided to fix this oversight.

EDITS:

TBD.
