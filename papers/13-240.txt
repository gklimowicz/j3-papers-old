Title: Array as bounds specification for explicit-shape array

Submitted by: Van Snyder

Status: For consideration

Basic functionality: Allow to use an array to specify the bounds of an
array.

Rationale: For arrays with more than a few dimensions, it is tedious to
specify their bounds in specification expressions individually if they
are available as an array.  One example is where they are the bounds of
other arrays.  It is impossible, not tedious, if all the bounds are
calculated by one function reference and returned as an array, because
function results cannot be subscripted.

Estimated impact: Minor

Markham M6 conformance: Remove simple deficiencies, discrepancies, and
pointless restrictions.

Detailed specification:  Allow to use an array to specify the bounds of
an array.  The array that specifies the bounds shall be a specification
expression.  The (first) extent shall be a constant expression, and the
rank of the declared array is that extent.
