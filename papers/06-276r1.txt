Questions and comments that are more than editorial.
Questions about macros are in a separate paper

[25:16-21] Most of this does not apply to the Fortran
character set and should be in clause 4.4.5

"The default character kind shall support a character
set that includes the Fortran character set. By supplying
nondefault character kinds, the processor may support
additional character sets. The characters available in
nondefault character kinds are not specified by this
standard, except that one character in each nondefault
character set shall be designated as a blank character
to be used as a padding character."

Withdrawn comments

[30:9] Does the "comments have no effect..." sentence mean
that compiler directives make a code non-standard?
