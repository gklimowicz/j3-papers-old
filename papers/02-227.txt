Subject:  Sqrt(complex)

In comp.lang.fortran, James Giles complained that the specified
return value for complex sqrt for certain values was wrong.
Subsequent discussion on the mailing list clarified the issue.
The edit below uses the Last Word from the mailing list discussion.

Edits:

347:20-21 Replace "When the ... to zero." with
"If the imaginary part of the argument is negative,
the imaginary part of the result shall not be positive.
Otherwise the imaginary part of the result shall be nonnegative."
