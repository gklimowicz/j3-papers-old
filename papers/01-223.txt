While reading Ch 9 in pursuit of Issue 127, I found
the following which resulted in comments:

(Edits to follow in another paper or a revision of this one.)

In Chapter 9,

4th Paragraph:

Does WAIT have a category?  Should it?

5th Paragraph:

record files are composed of records,
stream files are composed of a sequence of file storage units.
Surely similar language should be used in both descriptions.

9.2.2.3
unformatted (2) & formatted (4)
Add: There may be a last fsu.?

9.2.3
"first record or file storage unit" is unsymmetric
try "first record or first file storage unit"?

likewise
"last record or file storage unit" is unsymmetric
try "last record or last storage unit"?

Solutions to J3 Note 127:
There is a logical eof fsu (not preferred) -or-
There is a last fsu; reading any fsu after the last one
is eof (preferred) (unless you want reading _way_
past the last fsu to be an error?)
Also:
Is there a eof when the file is unbounded?
for example, a keyboard or an external device which
simply produces fsus?

a REWIND, BACKSPACE or ENDFILE following a partial
record write should complete the record.

9.4 pg 171
Note that this means that INQUIRE returning -1
via the NUMBER= specifier is affected.

9.5.4.4.3
io_mode is mentioned (in Ch 9) pg 194 and
in the arg lists of the DT procedures

pg 192 UI 295 (9.5.4.4.3)
Is 12.3.2 the right reference?

pg 205 UI 308
an Interp is beyond this paper
Edits to 1.5.1, add a paragraph something like:
"previous standards supported a PAD= specifier
on data transfer statements with a default value
of NO, if INQUIRE for an unconnected unit, NO
was returned.  Now it's UNDEFINED"
