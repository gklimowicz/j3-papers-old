Data

US 2.8 Should the transformational intrinsics such as CSHIFT be
applicable to array of types with allocatable component? If so, exactly
what is meant? 03-111, Donev. Accept.

be specified as private.  03-122, 03-107r1, Cohen. Accept.

UK TC2 and D i) Remove the option of re-specifying the default initial
value for the parent component when a type is extended. 03-122, Cohen. Accept.

US 2.1 and 2.7a Fix pointer assignment. 02-295r3, 03-110, 03-139, Donev. Accept.

US 2.2a Fix ambiguity re cloning via SOURCE. 03-112r1. Donev. Accept.

US 2.3 Reinstate deferred bindings. 03-113r1, Donev. Subgroup to consider.

US 2.7b Disallow type mismatches when the dummy argument is declared
with TYPE rather than CLASS. 03-110, 03-140, Hirchert.
Defer to J3 to take whatever action it considers appropriate.

US 2.15 Allow BOZ constants to have a kind type parameter value.
03-102, Snyder. Reject.

UK TC3 and D i) Allow default initialization of parameter values of
derived types.   03-116, Cohen. Accept.

type-bound procedures. 03-138, Cohen. Accept.

UK TC5  Correct SELECT TYPE (superseded by TC6). 03-132, Cohen. Accept.

UK TC6 and D i) Allow a CLASS(*) pointer to point to an object of any
type, including an intrinsic type. 03-144, Cohen. Accept.

UK TC7 Allow any non-SEQUENCE type to be extended. 03-145, Cohen. Accept.

UK TC8 and D i) Remove the TYPEALIAS facility. 03-119, Muxworthy. Accept.

same way as to an allocatable array component. 03-118r1, Muxworthy. Accept.

UK TC11  Allow reallocation of allocatable arrays. 03-137, Muxworthy.
Accept, but subgroup to consider.

D m) Remove [ and ] as alternatives to (/ and /). Reject.
