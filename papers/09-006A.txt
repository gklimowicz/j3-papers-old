Part 1: Interpretation Processing Rules
======================================================================

0. All interpretations are listed in J3 standing document 006.

1. Interpretations are processed by the J3/interp group and given a
   number.  The interpretation is marked "J3 consideration in
   progress".  An answer is formulated and presented to J3 in a
   meeting paper.

2. J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority vote
   marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

3. Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter ballot
   to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed by J3
   meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  Not voting on
   three of four consecutive J3 letter ballots is grounds to
   terminate J3 membership.  An interp answer passes by a 2/3rds
   vote; a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the
   changes necessary to change the member's vote to yes.

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

4. The chair of J3/interp gathers all interp answers that are marked
   "passed by J3 letter ballot" and forwards them to the WG5
   convenor.  The WG5 convenor holds a ballot of individual members;
   a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the changes
   necessary to change the member's vote to yes.  The answers that
   pass this ballot become "WG5 approved".

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

5. "WG5 approved" answers are processed into a corrigendum document
   by taking the edits from the interp answers and putting them in
   the format required by ISO.  A WG5 vote is made on forwarding the
   corrigendum to SC22.  Interps so forwarded are marked
   "Corrigendum".

6. J3/interp creates a edit for the next Fortran Standard if one is
   needed for all interps marked "Corrigendum".

QUESTION:  Consider the following program.

      PROGRAM P
        INTEGER, TARGET :: T

        CALL SUB(FPTR())
      CONTAINS
        FUNCTION FPTR()
          INTEGER, POINTER :: FPTR

          FPTR => T
        END FUNCTION FPTR
        SUBROUTINE SUB(IO)
          INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: IO

          IO = 17
        END SUBROUTINE SUB
      END PROGRAM P

According to 12.4.1 [200:30-32],

    "If a dummy argument is not a pointer and the corresponding
     actual argument is a pointer, the actual argument shall be
     currently associated with a target and the dummy argument
     becomes argument associated with that target."

According to 12.4.1 [201:19-21],

    "If a dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT), the actual
     argument shall be definable."

According to 5.1.2.3 [53:29-31],

    "The INTENT(OUT) attribute specifies that. . . any actual
     argument that becomes associated with such a dummy argument
     shall be definable."

The definition of "definable" supplied in Annex A (the term does not
appear to be defined in normative text) is:

    "A variable is <<definable>> if its value may be changed by the
     appearance of its <name> or <designator> on the left of an
     <assignment statement>."

According to this definition, "definable" is a property of variables
only.  In the example above, the actual argument is not a variable.
However, the actual argument is pointer associated with an object
that is definable.  The text cited from 5.1.2.3 refers to the
"actual argument that becomes associated with the dummy argument",
but the first piece of text cited from 12.4.1 makes it clear that
when the actual argument is a pointer, it is the target with which
it is associated that becomes argument associated with the dummy
argument, and not the actual argument itself.

Was it the intent of the committee that this program should not be
standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The program does not conform to the standard.

QUESTION:

Consider the following program.

PROGRAM questionable
  REAL,TARGET :: x
  CALL s1(f(x))
  CALL s2(f(x))
  CALL s3(f(x))
CONTAINS
  FUNCTION f(a)
    REAL,POINTER :: f
    REAL,TARGET :: a
    f => a
  END FUNCTION
  SUBROUTINE s1(variable)
    variable = 42                  ! statement 1
  END SUBROUTINE
  SUBROUTINE s2(variable)
    INTENT(OUT) variable
    variable = 42                  ! statement 2
  END SUBROUTINE
  SUBROUTINE s3(targ)
    REAL,TARGET :: targ
    REAL,POINTER :: p
    p => targ
    PRINT *,ASSOCIATED(p,x)        ! statement 3
  END SUBROUTINE
END

Is this program standard-conforming, and if so, what value is
printed?

The real question is whether an expression argument that is a pointer
function reference is treated as a variable (data-object) argument
with the variable being the target of the pointer expression.  (Or
whether it is dereferenced as usual in the absence of POINTER dummy
arguments).

Re (statement 1), the question is whether VARIABLE is definable when
argument-associated with "F()".

Re (statement 2), if the previous answer was Yes (VARIABLE is
definable), then presumably it can be made INTENT(OUT).  A random
sample of 4 compilers revealed that they considered it not to be
definable.

Re (statement 3), the question is whether P is pointer-associated
with X, not pointer-associated with X, or processor-dependent.  Of
the same random sample 3 thought it was associated with X, 1 thought
not.

ANSWER:

These answers are in the context of Fortran 2003.

1. The call to s1 is not standard conforming.  5.1.2.7 states
    "If no INTENT attribute is specified for a dummy argument, its use
     is subject to the limitations of the associated actual argument."
   The associated actual argument is the function reference f(x); this
   is an expression, not a variable, and therefore not definable,
   because only variables can be defined (in the sense of being given
   a value, see 2.4.3.1.1 and 2.5.5).

2. The call to s2 is not standard conforming. 12.4.1.2 says:
     "If a nonpointer dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT),
      the actual argument shall be definable."
   Again the actual argument is a function reference, which is not
   definable.

3. The call to s3 is standard conforming and the pointer assignment in
   s3 causes p and x to become associated. This may be deduced from
   12.4.1.2, which says [270:5-9]
     "If the dummy argument has the TARGET attribute, does not have
      the VALUE attribute, and is either a scalar or an assumed-shape
      array, and the corresponding actual argument has the TARGET
      attribute but is not an array section with a vector subscript
      then
        (1) Any pointers associated with the actual argument become
            associated with the corresponding dummy argument on
            invocation of the procedure ..."

TITLE: Are dummy functions returning assumed-length character legal?
KEYWORDS: DUMMY FUNCTION, ASSUMED-LENGTH CHARACTER
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Are dummy functions returning assumed-length character legal?

Consider the following program:

        character*5 f
        external f
          call ss3(f)
        end
        subroutine ss3(ff)
        character*(*) ff, a*10
        external ff
          a = ff()//'99999999'
          print *, '<', a, '>'
        end
        function f()
        character*(*) f
          f = '123'
        end

The issue is the call to the dummy function 'ff' in subroutine 'ss3'.
Some compilers issue an error message. Others print the result:

 <123  99999>

There appear to be two relevant, contradictory passages in the F95
standard. Refer to section 5.1.1.5. <> means italics, [] means
obsolescent font.

The third constraint says "A function name shall not be declared with
an asterisk <char-len-param-value> [unless it is the name of the
result of an external function or the name of a dummy function.]

Before note 5.6 on the next page, the third bullet says:
(3) [In an external function, the name of the function result may be
specified with a character length parameter value of *; in this case,
any scoping unit invoking the function shall declare the function
name with a character length parameter value other than * or access
such a definition by host or use association. When the function is
invoked, the length of the result variable in the function is assumed
from the value of this type parameter.]

According to the standard, the use in the example program is legal,
because 'ff' is the name of a dummy function. But it seems clear that
the standard intended that the length of the variable returned by
a character function be known at compile time; it is not known in the
case where the function is a dummy function.

Malcolm Cohen NO vote on F95/000098
   I agree with John that there is an issue here which is not
   adequately covered by Interp F95/000006.

   However, I think that the suggestion that item (3) of 5.1.1.5 means
   that the program is invalid is without merit.  A literal
   interpretation of item (3) means that even if subroutine SS3
   declared dummy FF as being CHARACTER*5, the program would still
   be invalid since the name of the function is F, not FF.  This
   would be a completely ridiculous result.  Thus item (3) of
   5.1.1.5 is faulty and an edit is required for it to handle
   (assumed-length) dummy functions at all.

John Reid  NO vote on 000098
This is different from interpretation 6 since the function has
assumed character length, which means that item (3) of page 51
applies.
Hence, I think the ANSWER should be
    The program does not conform with the standard because of the
    rule in item (3) of the list in 5.1.1.5. The function f is
    invoked from the scoping unit of ss3 within which the function
    name does not satisfy any of the required conditions.

TITLE: mask-expr evaluated only once
KEYWORDS: WHERE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

Is a mask-expr required to be evaluated in a WHERE such as:

      WHERE ( (/ .TRUE., .TRUE. /) )
        A = A + 1
      ELSE WHERE (MASKF())
        A = MAX
      END WHERE

where an optimizing compiler might notice that the ELSEWHERE
branch will never be executed ?

Page 112, line 38 says of the mask expression in ELSEWHERE statements

"The mask-expression is evaluated only once."

ANSWER:

The above quote is from the Fortran 95 standard.  In Fortran 2003 the
mask expression in an ELSEWHERE is not required to be evaluated, and
this is made clear by the fourth paragraph of 7.4.3.2 (at [147:7])
which, referring to a masked ELSEWHERE statement, states
  "The <mask-expr> is evaluated at most once."

This also applies to the mask expressions of nested WHERE construct
statements; this is made clear by the last sentence of the seventh
paragraph of 7.4.3.2 (at [147:16]) which also states that it is
evaluated "at most once".

However, this does not apply to the mask expression of the outermost
WHERE construct statement, which must be evaluated exactly once; this
is made clear by the last statement of the first paragraph of 7.4.3.2
(at [147:1]) which states that this mask expression is evaluated "only
once".  That does not guarantee invocation of functions in that
expression if they are not required to determine its value.

TITLE: Expressions in <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement
KEYWORDS: expression - specification, expression - initialization,
          FUNCTION statement, host association, use association
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The syntax rule R1217 shows that the type and type parameters of a
function can be specified in the FUNCTION statement (12.5.2.2).

(a) If a <type-spec> appears in a FUNCTION statement, can the
initialization and specification expressions of that <type-spec>
involve names of entities that are declared within the function or
are accessible there by host or use association?

(b) Section 5.1 states:

      "The <specification-expr> (7.1.6.2) of a <type-param-value>
       (5.1.1.5) or an <array-spec> (5.1.2.4) may be a nonconstant
       expression provided the specification expression is in an
       interface body (12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a
       subprogram."

As a FUNCTION statement is not part of the specification part of a
subprogram, this text in the standard appears to distinguish between
FUNCTION statements that are in interface blocks and ones that are
not. This text seems to prohibit such examples as:

         INTEGER I
          ...
         CONTAINS
           CHARACTER*(I+1) FUNCTION F()
              ...
              COMMON // I
              ...

where it can be confusing as to which I is being referenced in the
FUNCTION statement.  While host association does not apply to
interface bodies, for consistency should the text quoted from Section
5.1 have been "... is in the specification part of an interface body
(12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a subprogram."?

(c) Section 7.1.6.1 states:

      "If an initialization expression includes a reference to an
       inquiry function for a type parameter or an array bound of an
       object specified in the same <specification-part>, the type
       parameter or array bound must be specified in a prior
       specification of the <specification-part>."

Was this text intended to apply to FUNCTION statements even though
they are not part of any <specification-part>, thus disallowing
fragments such as:

      INTEGER (KIND=KIND(X)) FUNCTION F()
        INTEGER(KIND=KIND(0)) X
        ...

Similar text appears in Section 7.1.6.2.

ANSWER:

(a) A specification expression in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
statement may involve names of entities that are declared within the
function or are accessible there by host or use association, but an
initialization expression in such a <type-spec> may only involve
names that are accessible by host or use association.

(b) No.  It was not the intent of the standard to distinguish between
the two types of FUNCTION statements cited.  As elaborated in the
discussion of part (a), the standard intended to allow the
<type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement to be a nonconstant
expression.  The sentence cited is corrected with a supplied edit.

(c) Yes, the text cited from 7.1.6.1 was intended to apply to
FUNCTION statements.  The sentence quoted and the corresponding
sentence in 7.1.6.2 are corrected with supplied edits.  The code
fragment is not standard conforming.

Discussion:

(a) An initialization expression is a constant expression with an
additional rule relating to exponentiation (7.1.6.1).  Since it is a
constant expression, the only names it can contain are the names of
named constants, structure constructors, intrinsic procedures, and
variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about.

    * Named constant

      Section 5.1.2.1 states:

       "A named constant must not be referenced in any ... context
        unless it has been defined in a prior PARAMETER statement or
        type declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, or
        made accessible by use association or host association."

      Since the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
      scoping unit, there can be no prior PARAMETER statement or type
      declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, so the
      first clause does not apply. A named constant can appear in a
      <type-spec> of a function statement if it is accessible within
      the function by host or use association.

    * Structure constructor

      Rule R502 shows that the only opportunities for expressions to
      appear in <type-spec>s are in a <kind-selector> or in a
      <char-selector>.  However, a structure constructor can not
      appear in a <kind-selector> because rule R505 shows that a
      <kind-selector> must be an integer expression.  Similarly, R506
      shows that any initialization expression in a <char-selector>
      must be type integer.  Therefore, a structure constructor can
      not appear in an initialization expression in the <type-spec>
      of a FUNCTION statement.

    * Intrinsic procedure

      The intrinsic procedure names or classes of intrinsic
      procedures that may appear in an initialization expression are
      given in 7.1.6.1.

    * Variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about

      The text from section 7.1.6.1 as cited in question (c) was
      intended to apply to initialization expressions in the
      <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement.  With the correction
      supplied, this means that if a variable appears as the argument
      to an inquiry intrinsic in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
      statement, the function must be a module procedure or an
      internal procedure, and the variable must exist in (be
      accessible from) the host scoping unit.

Rule R502 defines <type-spec>.  The only opportunity for a
<type-spec> to contain a <specification-expr> is when the data type
is character (<type-param-value> may be a <specification-expr>).
Section 7.1.6.2 states that a specification expression is a
restricted expression that is scalar, of type integer, and each
operation must be intrinsic.  In addition, rule (2) of 7.1.6.2 states
that a primary of a specification expression can be a dummy argument
that has neither the OPTIONAL nor INTENT(OUT) attribute.  The
following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a dummy argument:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S(N)
              INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: N

Rule (2) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
dummy argument.  Section 6.1.2 indicates that a structure component
must not be referenced or defined before the declaration of the
parent object.  Similar rules are needed to prevent a substring from
being referenced ahead of the declaration of its parent, and an array
element or array section from being referenced ahead of the
declaration of the array.  Edits are provided to supply these rules.
Since a subobject can not be referenced before its parent object is
declared and the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
subprogram, the parent's declaration could not have occurred.  Thus a
subobject must not be referenced in the <type-spec> on a FUNCTION
statement for objects declared within the function.

Rule (3) states that a primary can be a variable that is in a common
block.  The following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a
common block member:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S()
              ...
              COMMON N

As in rule (2), rule (3) allows a subobject of such a variable but
for the same reasons as above, such a subobject designator can not
appear in the <type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement.

Rule (4) states that a primary may be a variable that is accessible
by use association or host association.  The following code fragments
demonstrate uses of such variables:

              PROGRAM MAIN
              INTEGER :: N = 21
              ...
              CONTAINS
                CHARACTER(LEN = 2*N) FUNCTION SS(K)    ! N is host
                ...                                    !  associated.
                END FUNCTION
              END PROGRAM

    and

              MODULE MOD
              INTEGER K
              DATA K /20/
              END MODULE

              CHARACTER*(K*2) FUNCTION CHECK(STR)      ! K is use
                                                       !  associated.
              USE MOD
              ...
              END FUNCTION

Rule (4) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
use or host associated variable.

A structure constructor can not appear in a FUNCTION <type-spec>
specification expression because the expression must be of type
integer and any operations (which might yield an integer value from
one or more structure constructors) must be intrinsic.

Other rules of 7.1.6.2 state which intrinsic procedure names or
classes of intrinsic procedures may appear in a specification
expression.

Section 7.1.6.2 also states:

        A variable in a specification expression must have its type
        and type parameters, if any, specified by a previous
        declaration in the same scoping unit, or by the implicit type
        rules currently in effect for the scoping unit, or by host or
        use association.

The discussion above regarding specification expressions has already
ruled out "previous declarations" so the first clause of the cited
sentence does not apply.  The other clauses apply equally to a
FUNCTION statement <type-spec> and to type declaration statements
inside the function.

(b) When the discussion for part (a) is applied to the code fragment
provided, it means that the 'I' referenced in the <type-spec> of the
FUNCTION statement is the common block member.

TITLE: Referencing deferred bindings
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, deferred binding
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

I thought that the intent was that it would be
impossible to reference a deferred binding.  However, it
doesn't appear to me that this intent was achieved.
Consider the following program (Sorry, but I don't have
any compilers up to syntax-checking this).

  module defer

    type, abstract :: t
    contains
      procedure (sub), nopass, deferred :: deferred_proc
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: deferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module defer
  program p
   use defer
   class(t), pointer :: x

   nullify(x)
   call x%deferred_proc

  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?

Note that x%deferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.  Nor is it clear that there is an intent
to prohibit invocation of type-bound procedures for disassociated
pointer objects; except in the case of deferred bindings, this
seems well-defined and potentially useful.

Because x is disassociated, its dynamic type is the same
as its declared type, thus making the interpretation of
x%nondeferred_proc reasonably clear.

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be a valid program. A type-bound
procedure may not be invoked through an undefined pointer, a
disassociated pointer, or an unallocated allocatable variable.
An edit is supplied to clarify this situation.  The same answer
and edit also apply to F03/0004.

TITLE: Type-bound procedures and undefined association status
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, dynamic type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

It appears that the dynamic type is undefined for a pointer with
undefined association status.  This impacts type-bound
procedures. Consider the following program.

  module undefined

    type :: t
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: nondeferred_proc => sub
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: nondeferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module undefined

  program p
    use undefined
    class(t), pointer :: x
    call x%nondeferred_proc
  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?  If so, what does it print.

Note that x%nondeferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.

If x were disassociated, its dynamic type would be t and the
interpretation of this would be reasonably clear.

However, the standard does not appear to specify the dynamic type
of x when its association status is undefined.  Nor can I find
any prohibition that applies to this case.

ANSWER:

No, the program is not valid, because the standard does not establish
an interpretation of it.  An edit is supplied to clarify this.

Furthermore, the case with a disassociated pointer was not intended to
be valid.  An edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

DISCUSSION:

Access to object-bound procedures (a.k.a. procedure pointer
components) always require there to be an object.  Access to
type-bound procedures of an object was intended to require this too,
but the effect of the NOPASS attribute on this was overlooked.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

QUESTION:

Does the following program conform to the 2003 standard?

  procedure(real), pointer :: F => null()
  call s ( f )
  contains
    subroutine S ( F )
      procedure(real), optional, pointer :: F
      print *, present(f)
    end subroutine S
  end

ANALYSIS:

The second paragraph of 12.4.1.3 requires that if the dummy argument
does not have the POINTER attribute and the actual argument does, the
actual argument shall be associated.  It is not clear in 13.7.91
whether the argument of PRESENT has or has not the POINTER attribute.

ANSWER:

The program conforms to the 2003 standard.  An edit is supplied to
remove any possibility of a contradictory reading of the relation
between 12.4.1.3 and 13.7.91.

EDITS:

In the second paragraph of 12.4.1.3 [271:16] replace "an associated"
by "a".

At the end of that paragraph, insert a new sentence:

"Except in references to intrinsic inquiry functions, if the actual
argument is a pointer it shall be associated."

  Michael Ingrassia's NO comment for F03/0017:

    The statement "It is not clear in 13.7.91 whether the argument of
    PRESENT has or has not the POINTER attribute" seems to me to be
    wrong. In the fragment
        subroutine S(I)
        integer, optional :: I
        if (present(I)) then
    the argument of present does not have the POINTER attribute, but in
    the fragment
        subroutine S(I)
        integer, pointer, optional :: I
        if (present(I)) then
    it does, and the language of 13.7.91 is clear enough "[the argument
    to PRESENT] may be a pointer".  Delete the statement ("It is not
    clear...").  Since that removes justification for the edits
    submitted, change the answer to read "The program does not conform
    to the 2003 standard.  This is because the pointer F is not
    associated in subroutine S, which is not one of the possibilities
    permitted by 12.4.1.3 [271:16]."

QUESTION 1:

Does the following program unit conform to the 2003 standard?

  module M
    type T
    contains
      procedure MyAdd
      generic :: operator(+) => myAdd
    end type T
    type X
    contains
      procedure, pass(b) :: MyAdd
      generic :: operator(+) => myAdd
    end type X
  contains
    integer function MyAdd ( A, B )
      type(t), intent(in) :: A
      type(x), intent(in) :: B
    end function MyAdd
  end module M

QUESTION 2:

Does the following program unit conform to the 2003 standard?

  module M
    interface operator(+)
      procedure MyAdd
    end interface
    type T
    contains
      procedure MyAdd
      generic :: operator(+) => myAdd
    end type T
  contains
    integer function MyAdd ( A, B )
      type(t), intent(in) :: A
      real, intent(in) :: B
    end function MyAdd
  end module M

QUESTION 3:

If the interface block and type definition are exchanged in QUESTION
2, does the program unit conform to the 2003 standard?

ANALYSIS:

The OPERATOR(+) bindings to the types T and X construct a single
generic OPERATOR(+) interface that is a local entity of module M.
They do not construct separate OPERATOR(+) generic interfaces that
are separate local entities of the types.

16.2.3 (Restrictions on generic declarations) specifies that it
"contains the rules that shall be satisfied by every pair of specific
procedures that have the same generic identifier within a scoping
unit."

It is clear that if different functions with identical interfaces
were bound to the types that they would be a "pair of specific
procedures" and the resulting OPERATOR(+) interface would therefore
be prohibited by 16.2.3.

It is not clear whether the generic bindings bind separate specific
procedures to the OPERATOR(+) generic, or only redundantly bind the
same procedure.  If the former, the program units are not standard
conforming because they violate the provisions of 16.2.3.  If the
latter, they appear to be standard conforming.

C1209 (in 12.3.2.1) prohibits a procedure to be bound to a generic
interface more than once in a scoping unit, but only by way of a
PROCEDURE statement in a generic interface block.  There is nothing
obviously equivalent in 4.5.4, nor anything that specifies that C1209
applies to generic bindings to types.  It also does not apply between
a generic interface block and a generic interface previously
specified by a generic binding to a type (question 3), since the
latter specific binding is accomplished by a conspiracy of a
<proc-binding-stmt> and a <generic- binding>, not by a
<procedure-stmt>.

ANSWER:

The program units conform to the 2003 standard.  Multiple bindings of
the same procedure to a generic identifier using a <generic-binding>
in a type definition or by a type definition and a generic interface
block do not bind a "pair of specific procedures" to the generic
interface. Indeed, the following type definition is legal:

  type Z
  contains
    procedure :: MyAdd
    generic :: operator(+) => myAdd, operator(+) => myAdd
  end type Z

Malcolm Cohen F03/0018: NO.
  I disagree completely with practically everything said in ANALYSIS.
  It's hard to know where to begin.

  (a) Why assert there is an OPERATOR(+) in the module and not in the
      types?  This is wrong - there is no OPERATOR(+) in the module;
      we know this, because ****WE CAN BLOCK IMPORTING IT BY DOING
      "use,only::x"***.  It is accessible in the module, but that is
      a horse of a different colour.

  (b) Q1 is not valid Fortran:

  Error: junk3.f90, line 17: Passed-object dummy argument A of
         type-bound procedure MYADD of T is not polymorphic (in actual
         procedure MYADD)
  Error: junk3.f90, line 17: Passed-object dummy argument B of
         type-bound procedure MYADD of X is not polymorphic (in actual
         procedure MYADD)

  (c) Q2 is not valid Fortran:

  Error: junk4.f90, line 15: Passed-object dummy argument A of
         type-bound procedure MYADD of T is not polymorphic (in
         actual procedure MYADD)

  (d) Multiple occurrences of a single specific in a generic have
      not been allowed before.  If we are going to consider the
      example in the ANSWER section, I'd think we'd expect it to
      be invalid.  Certainly, there is no (good or otherwise)
      reason for it to be valid.

  (e) Furthermore, the example in the ANSWER section has nothing to
      do with the question asked.

QUESTION 1:

Does the following program conform to the 2003 standard?

  program P
    interface X
      subroutine S ( A )
        integer :: A
      end subroutine S
      procedure S
    end interface X
  end program P

ANALYSIS:

16.2.3 (Restrictions on generic declarations) specifies that it
"contains the rules that shall be satisfied by every pair of specific
procedures that have the same generic identifier within a scoping
unit."

It is not clear whether the interface body and the procedure
statement bind separate specific procedures to the generic
identifier, or only redundantly bind the same procedure.  If the
former, the program is not standard conforming because it violates
the provisions of 16.2.3.  If the latter, it appears to be standard
conforming.

C1209 (in 12.3.2.1) prohibits a procedure to be bound to a generic
interface more than once in a scoping unit, but only by way of a
PROCEDURE statement in a generic interface block.

There is a general rule that nothing shall be declared more than
once. It appears that a procedure statement within an interface block
is not a declaration:  5.1.2.6 (External attribute) specifies that
the external attribute may be specified by an EXTERNAL statement, a
<procedure- declaration-stmt> or an interface body that is not in an
abstract interface block.  A procedure statement in an interface
block apparently does not specify the external attribute.  The
procedure specified by the PROCEDURE statement in the above example
is clearly an external procedure with an explicit interface, so it
satisfies the requirements of C1207.

ANSWER:

The program conforms to the 2003 standard.  Multiple bindings of the
same procedure to a generic identifier using an interface body and a
procedure statement do not bind a "pair of specific procedures" to
the generic interface.

Enforcing C1209 is more bother for processors than simply allowing
multiple bindings of a particular specific procedure to a generic
interface.  It is unhelpful to users, and can be hurtful if the
multiple bindings are specified by independent generic interfaces and
brought into a scoping unit by use association from different
modules.  There was no equivalent constraint in Fortran 90, although
something like it was added by interp F90/000007.  The constraint
added there applied only to a single specification part.  It's not
clear whether that meant "declared in the same specification part" or
"accessible in the same specification part."  When it was put into
Fortran 95, it clearly applied to all accessible generic interfaces
with a particular <generic-spec>.  Given the multitude of new ways to
bring specific procedures into a generic interface in Fortran 2003,
and that many of those ways allow a specific procedure to be bound to
a generic identifier more than once, this conspicuously lonely
constraint should be removed.  Edits are supplied to correct this
oversight.

TITLE: Coexistence of IEEE and non-IEEE kinds
KEYWORDS: IEEE, kind
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is it allowed for a processor to have one or more real kinds for which
there is no IEEE support, while also having real kinds for which there
is IEEE support?

Much of the IEEE material appears to assume that a processor could
simultaneously support both IEEE and non-IEEE kinds.  I thought this
was the intent.  However, the first sentence of the second paragraph
in section 14 says that if IEEE_EXCEPTIONS or IEEE_ARITHMETIC is
accessible in a scoping unit, then IEEE_OVERFLOW and
IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO are supported in the scoping unit for *ALL*
[emphasis mine] kinds of real and complex data.  This says to me
that if there is any kind of real for which the processor cannot
support IEEE_OVERFLOW or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO, then pretty much none
of the IEEE stuff can be used on that processor at all; there
isn't much of the IEEE stuff that can be used without IEEE_ARITHMETIC
or IEEE_EXCEPTIONS.  This seems draconian and unintended.

I speculate that this condition is intended to apply to all IEEE
real kinds rather than to all real kinds.

ANSWER:

Yes, this is allowed.

The requirement that IEEE_OVERFLOW and IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO be
supported for all kinds of real and complex data within that
scoping unit was intentional.

Support of these two flags means that the exceptions can be detected,
either by a subsequent use of IEEE_GET_FLAG or by program termination
(this is not under program control unless IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING is true
for those flags).

Whether the flags are supported outside of a routine which uses
IEEE_EXCEPTIONS or IEEE_ARITHMETIC is processor dependent.

None.

  Dick Hendrickson's NO comment on F03/0022:

    The answer doesn't appear to answer the details of the
    question.  Saying that IEEE and non-IEEE reals are both
    allowed is not an answer the question about REQUIRING
    overflow and divide by zero for the NON-IEEE reals in the
    second paragraph.  What practical use is there in requiring
    a processor to support overflow and divide-by-zero for
    NON-IEEE reals in a subroutine that uses both kinds of
    reals?  Surely the purpose of NON-IEEE reals is that they
    are not bound by the same rules as the IEEE reals are.
    Why was it intentional to bind at least some of the IEEE
    rules to them?   The answer should be reversed to state
    that the speculation in the last paragrpah of the question
    is correct, and edits provided.

What exactly does "whole" mean in this rule?

Specifically, is the following allowed:

REAL, DIMENSION(:), POINTER :: a, b

b=>a(1:10)
DEALLOCATE(b)

ANSWER:

Yes, this is allowed, since "whole" means that b is
ASSOCIATED with all elements of an array that was ALLOCATEd.
In the given example, ASSOCIATED(a,b) is .TRUE., therefore either
a or b can be used to DEALLOCATE the memory.

    The answer appears to be incomplete.  The question is

    the answer appears to be limited just to the specific
    example given.  We also need to consider things like
           b=>a(10:1:-1)
    Also, pining the answer to ASSOCIATED is risky for
    understanding other cases.  ASSOCIATED is true for
    zero sized things.  Given
           ALLOCATE(A(0),C(0))

QUESTION:

Is infinity / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?
Is NaN / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?

Fortran 2003 defines (in 14.2) infinity / zero and NaN / zero
cases as IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO.  IEEE-754 defines (in 6.1 and 6.2)
those two as unexceptional.

ANSWER:

On an IEEE-conformant processor, these cases do not raise exceptions
(see clauses 6.1 and 6.2 of IEEE-754).

The definitions in 14.2 were intended to describe IEEE exceptions with
sufficient latitude to allow use on near-IEEE and non-IEEE machines.
However, the definition of IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO is not consistent with
the IEEE International Standard.

Furthermore, the definition of the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag is also not
consistent with the IEEE standard, because this exception is not
raised for operations on infinite operands.

QUESTION:

What is HYPOT(NaN,infinity)? HYPOT(NaN,finite)?

HYPOT(X,Y) when X and/or Y is an infinity (even if the other is
a NaN) shall be +infinity.  Reason: hypot(), when one of the
arguments is an infinity, is +infinity independent of the
value of the other argument.  So, if the NaN argument is
replaced by zero, any finite number, or any infinity,
hypot(infinity,NaN) is still infinity.

HYPOT(X,Y) when X and/or Y is a NaN (and neither is infinite)
shall be a NaN, and should one of the NaN arguments.

ANSWER:

The HYPOT example in note 14.17 illustrates the use of the features
of this section to provide reliable software that is fast in the
uncomplicated case.  We did not consider what would happen if one
of the arguments is a NaN and have therefore edited the text slightly.

DISCUSSION:

In fact, if either X or Y is a NaN, the first executable statement
will set HYPOT to a NaN without signaling an exception. The slower
code in the IF construct will therefore not be executed and a NaN
will be returned, which is consistent with the way NaNs are handled
by intrinsic operators, see paragraph 3 of section 6.2 of the
IEEE International Standard.

  is irrelevant and misleading.  It is irrelevant because
    (a) this is not the clause on C interoperability
    (b) even if it were in the C interoperability clause, whether
        an example of user code has the same behaviour as a library
        (or intrinsic) function defined by another standard has
        nothing to do with this standard.

  It is misleading because it implies that other functions, whether
  intrinsic (actually defined by the standard) or example user code
  might necessarily have the same behaviour as that of another
  function defined in another standard.  This is most emphatically
  NOT the case!  For example, our FLOOR and CEILING intrinsics
  return different data types from the C library functions of the
  same name.  Similarly, for the user-written FUNCTION SIN in clause
  16 (which has its body omitted) there is no implication that it

13.7 [300:13-15] incorrectly requires an infinite result or a
NaN result to always signal some IEEE exception.

Consider changing [300:13] "infinite result" to "infinite result
(from finite arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical
operations on infinity that produce an infinity are
unexceptional.

Consider changing [300:14] "NaN result" to "NaN result (from
non-NaN arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical operations
on quiet NaN operands that produce a quiet NaN result are
unexceptional.

Consider adding to 13.7 [300:15+] something along the lines of:
"Unless specified otherwise, a math function with NaN
argument(s) shall return a NaN, which should be one of the NaN
arguments."  This allows not having to specify the results for
each specific math function.

Consider adding the above suggested cases to each of the 13.7.*
functions, perhaps, with a bold face IEEE sub-heading.

ANSWER:

The penultimate sentences of 13.7 was intended for the case
where all arguments on entry have normal or denormal values
and edits are supplied to correct this.

To specify the results of all the intrinsics for non-normal
values is beyond the scope of an interpretation. Perhaps this
should be considered for an extension that is adopted for the
next revision of the standard. Meanwhile, guidance is provided
by the second and third paragraphs of 14.8, which state

"The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN is provided to inquire
whether the processor supports IEEE NaNs. Where these are supported,
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard.

The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_INF is provided to inquire whether
the processor supports IEEE infinities. Where these are supported,
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard. "

[300:13&14] Subclause 13.7. In the penultimate sentence, replace
"If" by "If the values of all input arguments are normal or
denormal and" and replace "if" by "if the values of all input
arguments are normal or denormal and"

NUMBER: F03/0046
TITLE: Unlimited polymorphic pointers in common blocks
KEYWORDS: Unlimited polymorphic pointer, common block
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        COMMON /blk1/ x
        CLASS(*), POINTER :: x
        CALL sub
      END PROGRAM

      SUBROUTINE sub
        COMMON /blk1/ x
        CLASS(*), POINTER :: x
      END SUBROUTINE

There appears to be nothing prohibiting an unlimited polymorphic
pointer from appearing in a common block, but the following appears in
Fortran 2003 at [100:10]:
    A data pointer shall be storage associated only with data pointers
    of the same type and rank.

And at [75:23-25]:
    An object declared with the CLASS(*) specifier is an unlimited
    polymorphic object.  An unlimited polymorphic entity is not
    declared to have a type.  It is not considered to have the same
    declared type as any other entity, including another unlimited
    polymorphic entity.

It appears that it is not standard conforming to have an unlimited
polymorphic pointer that is storage associated with anything else,
including another unlimited polymorphic pointer.  So, while it is
apparently standard-conforming to have an unlimited polymorphic
pointer in a common block, a common block with the same name cannot be
accessed in any other scoping unit.

This interpretation also seems to be supported by parts of section 16
of the standard.

At [416:7-24]:
    In a storage association context
    ...
      (8) A pointer occupies a single unspecified storage unit that is
          different from that of any nonpointer object and is
          different for each combination of type, type parameters, and
          rank.

At [417:12-13]:
    All scoping units that access named common blocks with the same
    name shall specify an identical sequence of storage units.

And at [417:14-17]:
    For any two blank common blocks, the initial sequence of storage
    units of the longer blank common block shall be identical to the
    sequence of storage units of the shorter common block.  If two
    blank common blocks are the same length, they shall have the same
    sequence of storage units.

Was it intended that an unlimited polymorphic pointer should be
allowed in a common block?  If yes, then was it intended that such a
common block should be accessible in more than one scoping unit?

ANSWER:

No.  An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

         "a polymorphic pointer,".

Malcolm Cohen NO vote on F03/0046.

  There is no rationale given for rejecting ultimate polymorphic
  pointers in common blocks.  Perhaps the thought was that they
  MIGHT point to objects of non-SEQUENCE non-BIND
  non-default-intrinsic type, and that since such a pointer with
  that declared type would be disallowed, so should ultimate
  polymorphic pointers.

  This reasoning is inconsistent with the answer given in F03/0053,
  where (currently-disallowed) TYPE(C_PTR) pointers were added to
  the list of things allowed in common.  However, a TYPE(C_PTR)
  might also point to an object of non-SEQUENCE non-BIND
  non-default-intrinsic type.

TITLE: Polymorphic arguments to intrinsic procedures
KEYWORDS: polymorphism, intrinsic procedures
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The descriptions of the intrinsic procedures often use the term "type"
without qualification.  It is unclear whether they mean "declared
type" or "dynamic type".  If they mean "dynamic type", then this would
appear to allow unlimited polymorphic arguments to intrinsic
procedures like ABS and SIN.  Resolution of generic intrinsic
procedures in this case would create an undue (and likely unintended)
burden on the processor, and the declared type of the result of such a
function call would be unclear as well.

Question 1:
Are the arguments of the intrinsic functions ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED,
LBOUND, SHAPE, SIZE, and UBOUND permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 2:
(a) Is the ARRAY argument of the intrinsic function CSHIFT permitted
    to be polymorphic?

    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 3:
(a) Are the ARRAY and BOUNDARY arguments of the intrinsic function
    EOSHIFT permitted to be polymorphic?

(a) Are the A and MOLD arguments of the intrinsic function
    EXTENDS_TYPE_OF permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 5:
(a) Are the TSOURCE and FSOURCE arguments of the intrinsic function
    MERGE permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 6:
Are the FROM and TO arguments of the intrinsic function MOVE_ALLOC
permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 7:
(a) Are the ARRAY and VECTOR arguments of the intrinsic function PACK
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?

    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 9:
(a) Are the A and B arguments of the intrinsic function SAME_TYPE_AS
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 10:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function SPREAD permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 11:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER
    permitted to be polymorphic?
(b) Is the MOLD argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If the answer to (b) is yes:
(c) If the MOLD argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 12:
(a) Is the MATRIX argument of the intrinsic function TRANSPOSE
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 13:
(a) Are the VECTOR and FIELD arguments of the intrinsic function
    UNPACK permitted to be polymorphic?

Many of the answers seem to be incorrect or unjustified, and
the edits are deficient and in poor style.

Answer 4(c) is, I believe, incorrect.  It is certainly inconsistent with
the philosophy of the type extension facility in Fortran 2003.
   Question 4:
   (a) Are the A and MOLD arguments of the intrinsic function
       EXTENDS_TYPE_OF permitted to be polymorphic?
   If so:
   (b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
       polymorphic?
   (c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
       or dynamic types?
   Answer 4:
   (a) Yes.
   (b) No.
   (c) The requirements refer to the dynamic type.
- This answer would imply that the EXTENDS_TYPE_OF intrinsic is unsafe to
  use on unlimited polymorphic arguments, because it could give type errors
  at runtime.  This is something that we have strenuously tried to avoid in
  the type extension facility (as shown by the provision of such things as
  the SELECT TYPE construct).
- Furthermore, the requirements CANNOT be satisfied by a disassociated or
  unallocated unlimited polymorphic, because such an entity has NO DYNAMIC
  TYPE.  (The Result Value clause makes it clear that support for these was
  intended.) Therefore the requirements are, in fact, faulty.
The answer should be
  (c) The requirements refer to the declared type, but are faulty in that
      they do not take unlimited polymorphic pointers into account.
      Edit: [316:16,17]  Change "an object of extensible type" to
            "an object that is unlimited polymorphic or of extensible
             declared type".

Answer 5(b) is not justified by the current text in the standard, and I
see no reason to create such a requirement.
  Question 5:
  (a) Are the TSOURCE and FSOURCE arguments of the intrinsic function
      MERGE permitted to be polymorphic?
  If so:
  (b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
      polymorphic?
  (c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
      declared types or dynamic types?
  (d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
      What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?
  Answer 5:
  (a) Yes.
  (b) Yes.
- There is no justification, and no need, for this unnecessary restriction.
  Not only is it unnecessary, it inhibits use of MERGE when some variables
  are polymorphic.  If the requirements refer to both the declared type and
  the dynamic type, that is sufficient to make MERGE useful.
  (c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
      type.
- I agree that this should be the case.
  (d) In this case, the result is polymorphic.  If the arguments are
      unlimited polymorphic, then the result is unlimited polymorphic
      and its dynamic type is the same as that of the arguments.
      Otherwise, the declared and dynamic types of the result are the
      same as those of the arguments.
- And this answer should be that if BOTH arguments are polymorphic, the
  result is polymorphic.  If only one is polymorphic, the result need not
  be as the declared and dynamic type are known to be one and the same.

Similar considerations lead me to question answer 7(b) and 7(d),
8(b) and 8(d), 13(b) and 13(d).

Answer 9(c) is deficient and contradicted by the (currently faulty!) text of
the standard, in the same way that answer 4(c) is:
  Question 9:
  (a) Are the A and B arguments of the intrinsic function SAME_TYPE_AS
      permitted to be polymorphic?
  If so:
  (b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
      polymorphic?
  (c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
      or dynamic types?
  Answer 9:
  (a) Yes.
  (b) No.
  (c) The requirements refer to the dynamic type.
- The requirements CANNOT refer to the dynamic type because a disassociated
  unlimited polymorphic does not have one.
- The standard does not mention unlimited polymorphics in this subclause;
  that is because the result for a disassociated unlimited polymorphic is
  rather obvious (follows directly from the existing text) and does not need
  to be a special case.
- The requirement "of extensible type" is faulty and should be repaired in
  the same way as EXTENDS_TYPE_OF.

Answer 11(b) is not justified by existing text in the standard, and
violates TRANSFER requirements.
  Question 11:
  (b) Is the MOLD argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER permitted
      to be polymorphic?
  Answer 11:
  (b) No.
- This contradicts [356:30-33] which requires, e.g. that (given suitable
  types and sizes) "... the value of TRANSFER(TRANSFER(E,D),E) shall be
  the value of E".

Re the EDITS.

I strongly object to the addition of these two tables to the standard.
They are ad hoc and help no-one to decide whether a function that is
not in these tables (e.g. the many vendor-extension intrinsics) should
accept polymorphic arguments or not.

Instead, the rules which underlie these tables must be exposed.

For example,

  "An actual argument to an intrinsic function may be polymorphic only if
   the corresponding dummy argument accepts values of any type."

and one could follow it up with something like:

  "If the result of an intrinsic function is specified to have the same type
   as that of one of its arguments, the result is polymorphic if and only if
   that argument is polymorphic, and is unlimited polymorphic if and only if
   that argument is unlimited polymorphic.  In both cases the dynamic type of
   the result is that of the actual argument."

Furthermore, I even more strongly object to arbitrary additional
conditions on the dummy arguments of some functions being placed
separately from the description of those functions.  This just means
the reader has to jump around inside the document quite unnecessarily.

If clarifying text is required (as it doubtless is) in specific cases
when it is not clear which of the dynamic and declared types is being
referenced, I think there are two reasonable choices:
(1) specify a rule like the above which allows the reader to deduce
    the answer, and which is extensible to new intrinsic functions, or
(2) clarify the text in the function in question
Or possibly even both if that is warranted.
Addition of an ad hoc list of functions and arguments is unsatisfactory
in this regard.

Consider the following program:

9.5.3.7.2 states:
  A record positioning edit descriptor, such as TL and TR, used on
  unit by a child data transfer statement shall not cause the record
  position to be positioned before the record position at the time the
  user-defined derived-type input/output procedure was invoked.

The term "record position" is used, but it doesn't appear to be
defined anywhere.  Depending on the interpretation, the above program
might be standard-conforming, or it might not be.

If "record position" is taken to mean "the position within the current
record", regardless of which record is the current record, then the
record position at the beginning of the UDDTIO procedure is before the
fourth character of the record.  The first child data transfer
statement begins a new record, and the second child data transfer
statement writes to the first character of the new record.  This would
be before the "record position" at the time the UDDTIO procedure was
invoked, and the program would not be standard-conforming.

If "record position" is taken to mean a combination of the record and
the position within that record (essentially making it mean the same
thing as "file position"), then the above program is standard-
conforming, since the control edit descriptor doesn't cause the file
to be positioned before the record position when the UDDTIO procedure
was invoked.

What is the meaning of "record position", and is the above program
standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The term "record position" is not well defined.

The intent of 9.5.3.7.2 was to prohibit a child data transfer statement
from possibily overwriting or re-reading any characters in the current
record that an active parent I/O statement had previously written or read.
9.5.3.7.2 should have used the term "file position" instead of
"record position".

Therefore, the program is standard-conforming, and prints
 xyz.3
AB

where the first record starts with a space and the "." represents 0 or
more spaces.

Edits are supplied to clarify the intent of 9.5.3.7.2,
add "file position" to the glossary, and remove the phrases
"record position" and "record positioning" from the standard.

EDITS:

[202:34] In section 9.5.3.7.2, in the paragraph that begins with
    "Because a child data transfer statement does not position the
    file prior to data transfer,"

replace
    "list item or record positioning edit descriptor"
with
    "list item or edit descriptor"


[202:36] In section 9.5.3.7.2, replace the phrase
    "A record positioning edit descriptor, such as TL and TR,"
with
    "The edit descriptors T and TL,"

[463:4]  In section C.6.2, first paragraph, delete "record positioning"

[430:4+] In Annex A, add this definition:
  "<<file position>> (9.2.3): A connected unit has a file position.
  A unit's file position typically affects where the next data transfer
  operation will begin transferring data into or out of the file.  The
  file position is usually just before a record, just after a record,
  within a record, just before the first file storage unit in the
  file, just after the last file storage unit in the file, or
  between two adjacent file storage units."

  Bill Long's YES comment on F03/0048:

    In looking at the test resulting from the edits, it seems like it
    would be better to delete paragraph [202:36-203:2] and instead
    add this paragraph at [236:2+]:

      "The left tab limit for a child data transfer statement is the
       file position of the parent data transfer statement at the time
       that the user-defined derived-type input/output procedure was
       invoked."

    on the grounds that the stuff related to Tx edit descriptors
    really belongs in 10.7.1.1.

    Given that the concept of left tab limit already includes most of
    what is in the paragraph at [202:32-34], one might consider
    deleting that paragraph as redundant.

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

    INTEGER i
  END TYPE
  INTERFACE WRITE(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedWriteT
  END INTERFACE
CONTAINS
  SUBROUTINE formattedWriteT(dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)

  END SUBROUTINE
END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  TYPE(t) :: t1 = t(5)
  OPEN(10, FILE='foo.txt', ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL', FORM='FORMATTED', &
       DELIM='NONE')
  WRITE(10, *) 'xyz', t1, 'zyx'
END PROGRAM

10.9.2 of Fortran 2003 states that character sequences produced for
list-directed output are not separated from each other by value
separators when the delimiter mode is NONE.  The implication of this
is obvious when the adjacent effective output list items are both of
character type.  But when user-defined derived-type input/output
is involved, it is much less clear whether a separator should be
included in the output.

In the example given, it is unclear whether the output should be:
 xyz 5 azyx
or:
 xyz 5 a zyx

1. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when one of the character sequences is written by a child
   data transfer statement, and the other is written by a parent data
   transfer statement, where both statements are list-directed?

2. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when the character sequences are written by two different
   child data transfer statements, where both statements are
   list-directed?

3. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   one of the character sequences is written by a child data transfer
   statement, and the other is written by a parent data transfer
   statement, where one of the statements is list-directed and the
   other is format-directed?

4. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   the character sequences are written by two different child data
   transfer statements, where one of the statements is list-directed
   and the other is format-directed?

There is also the further question of whether, in the case of
recursive i/o, this is affected by intervening i/o operations to a
different unit.  For example, in the modified program:

    MODULE m2
     TYPE t
       INTEGER i
     END TYPE

     INTERFACE WRITE(FORMATTED)
       MODULE PROCEDURE formattedWriteT
     END INTERFACE

    CONTAINS

     SUBROUTINE formattedWriteT(dtv,unit,iotype,v_list,iostat,iomsg)
       CLASS(t),         INTENT(IN)    :: dtv
       INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: unit
       CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
       INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: v_list(:)
       INTEGER,          INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
       CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

       CHARACTER(100) temp

       WRITE (temp,'(I0)') dtv%i
       WRITE (unit,*) TRIM(temp)
     END SUBROUTINE

    END MODULE

    PROGRAM foo2
     USE m2
     TYPE(t) :: t1 = t(5)

     OPEN(10, FILE='foo.txt', ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL', &
          FORM='FORMATTED', DELIM='NONE')
     WRITE(10, *) 'xyz', t1, 'zyx'

    END PROGRAM

5. Does the second example write
     xyz 5xyz
   or
     xyz5xyz

   That is, in this case, does the data transfer which is an internal
   file write affect whether 'xyz' and TRIM(temp) are adjacent?

6. Similarly, if the outer list-directed WRITE were to an internal
   file does an intervening external file i/o operation affect whether
   the character sequences are considered adjacent (i.e. the opposite
   way around to the second example)?

ANSWER:

1) No. It is the intent of the standard (10.9.2) that when both the
   parent and child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both are namelist output statements, the
   processor treats the first list item appearing in a child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately
   followed the last list item processed by the parent data
   transfer statement, as long as no other data transfers to that
   unit occurred in between the processing of those two list items.
   Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences are
   considered adjacent.

2) No. It is the intent of the standard (10.9.2) that when two
   different child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both namelist output statements, they write
   to the same unit, and no other data transfers to that unit occur
   in between the two child data transfer statements, the processor
   treats the first list item appearing in the second child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately followed
   the last list item processed by the first child data transfer
   statement.  Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences
   are considered adjacent.

3) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  In section 10.9.2, the
   phrase "adjacent undelimited character sequences" refers to
   character sequences produced by list-directed output.  When one of
   the sequences is written by a child or parent output statement
   that is not list-directed, the exception described in the first
   paragraph of 10.9.2 does not apply. The other rules for inserting
   optional blanks around values in list-directed output allow the
   processor to insert optional leading and trailing blanks around a
   list item.  The standard does not specify when optional blanks are
   written; therefore, when two adjacent list items (the values
   thereof) are written to an output record, and only one of them was
   written by list-directed input/output, the standard does not
   specify whether or not any optional blanks appear between those
   values in the output record.

4) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  See answer 3.

5) The result should be "xyz5xyz", that is, the recursive i/o to the
   internal file does not affect whether the character sequences being
   written by the outer data transfer statement are considered
   adjacent.

6) No, if an outer data transfer is to an internal file, then a
   recursive i/o operation to a different internal file or an external
   file does not affect whether the character sequences are considered
   adjacent.

NOTE TO J3:

In Fortran 2008, recursive i/o operations to a different external unit
are allowed and these also ought not to affect whether the character
sequences written by the outer data transfer statement are considered
to be adjacent.  The edit to F2003 below will produce that result when
applied to the (draft) F2008.

EDITS:

[241:5] In Section 10.9.2, add the following to the end of the
        first paragraph:
  "Two undelimited character sequences are considered adjacent when
   both were written using list-directed input/output, no intervening
   data transfer or input/output file positioning operations on that
   unit occurred, and both were written either by a single data
   transfer statement, or during the execution of a parent data
   transfer statement along with its child data transfer statements."

  READ(10, *) a
  PRINT *, a%i, a%j, ipos
END PROGRAM

10.9 of Fortran 2003 states that the r*c form of list-directed input
is equivalent to r occurrences of c.  So, when the read is performed,
it is as if the input record contains two occurrences of the number 3.

The first child read statement reads the first 3, and does not advance
the file position to the next record (because it is a child data
transfer statement).  It appears that the second read statement should
read the second 3.  But the file position between the child read
statements is unclear.

What does the above program print?

ANSWER:

The standard does not specify the behavior of a processor when a list
directed input record contains a r*c constant, and that entire set
of input values is not completely consumed by one list directed
input statement. In particular, the file position for such an input
file when the processor is in the middle of consuming an r*c value,
and a child input statement is invoked, is not defined.  This was an
oversight.  Edits are supplied to prohibit r*c constants in this
case.  The above program is not standard conforming.

EDITS:

  Jim Xia's NO vote on F03/0051:

    While I agree with the spirit of the interp, the edit seems to
    have a problem.  Consider the text in the edit marked between
    *** below:

      "When the first value of an <r*c> constant is transferred to a
       list item by a list-directed input statement, that input
       statement shall transfer all <r> values of that <r*c> constant
       ***to list items*** before causing any child input statement
       to be invoked.  If that list-directed input statement is itself
       a child input statement, it shall transfer all <r> values of
       that <r*c> constant ***to list items*** before terminating."

    There may not be enough list items to transfer all <r> values to.
    I think the input statement should transfer as many (up to <r>)
    values as are available list items and then ignore (throw away)
    the rest.

    For example, for the program in the interp document:
    The first child input statement encounters 2*3. It will transfer
    a number 3 to dtv%i. There are no more list items to transfer the
    second 3 to, so I believe it should skip the second number 3.

    Here is another example, this time with the parent statement:

      PROGRAM foo
        USE m
        TYPE(t) :: a
        INTEGER :: i
        OPEN(10, FILE='file.txt', ACCESS='stream', FORM='formatted')
        WRITE(10, '(A)') '2*3 5 6'
        REWIND(10)

        READ(10, *) i, a           !<-- parent READ encounters 2*3
        PRINT *, i, a%i, a%j, ipos
      END PROGRAM

    The parent statement is the first statement to encounter 2*3. It
    transfers 3 to i, but cannot transfer the second <c> constant to
    a list item.  At the beginning of the user-defined procedure, the
    file should be positioned just before the number 5 (i.e. the rest
    of the 2*3 is ignored).  Otherwise, the problem with file
    position reappears.

1. Do the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND
attribute?

This affects whether an object of one of these types is permitted
directly in COMMON.  C589, p. 98 states "If a common-block-object is
of a derived type, it shall be a sequence type (4.5.1) or a
type with the BIND attribute and it shall have no default
initialization."

It also affects whether the types are extensible. 4.5.6 states
"A nonsequence derived type that does not have the BIND attribute is
an extensible type."

2. 15.2.2 states that C_PTR and C_FUNPTR are derived types with
private components. Are user-defined derived types with the BIND
attribute permitted to have private components?

ANSWER:

1. Yes, it was intended that these types have the BIND attribute.
An edit makes this clear.

2. A user-defined derived type with the BIND attribute is permitted
to have private components.

DISCUSSION:

1. It was intended that the behaviour of these types be similar to
that of user-declared derived types in all respects except that
they interoperate with C pointer types rather than C struct types.
As well as the two cases cited in the question, there are special
conditions in a pointer assignment statement (7.4.2) if either the
pointer or the target has the BIND attribute. Also, there is a
restriction on types with the BIND attribute in a SELECT TYPE
statement (8.1.5).

2. The rules for the interoperability of a C struct type with a
Fortran derived type are less restrictive than the rules in
4.5.1.3 that determine whether two separately declared Fortran
types, both with the BIND attribute, are the same. For the types
to be the same, the names of corresponding components must agree and
all components must be public. It follows that two types may be
different although they both interoperate with the same C struct
type.

Malcolm Cohen NO vote on F03/0053

The answer to this interp is inconsistent with the answer to F03/0046,
as explained in my comment on the latter.

The discussion states:

  1. It was intended that the behaviour of these types be similar to
  that of user-declared derived types in all respects except that
  they interoperate with C pointer types rather than C struct types.

That would appear to be the case whether they have the BIND attribute
or not, so this does not help to explain the U-turn.  User-defined
types are permitted not to have the BIND attribute.

  As well as the two cases cited in the question, there are special
  conditions in a pointer assignment statement (7.4.2) if either the
  pointer or the target has the BIND attribute.

This does not seem to cause a problem whether these types have the
BIND attribute or not.

  Also, there is a restriction on types with the BIND attribute in a
  SELECT TYPE statement (8.1.5).

This is not a "new" point at all, merely a consequence of whether or
not these types are extensible.  There is no technical reason for
these types not to be extensible - unlike SEQUENCE and BIND(C) types
these types are in fact unique and therefore suited for extensibility.

In summary, there appears to no technical justification and several
non-sequiturs in the rationale.  We should not reverse one of the
provisions of the standard without good cause.

  Rich Bleikamp's NO comment for F03/0059:

    The replacement text reads "if the variable would not be processed
    by a UDDTIO ...", but I think the presence of an object designator
    might actually determine whether or not the object designator is
    processed by a UDDTIO routine (sort of the reverse decision
    process than what is being suggested, where being processed by a
    UDDTIO routine precludes the use of a non-simple variable name in
    the input record).

    Second, the sentence immediately after the replaced text talks
    about "Successive qualifications" being applied to the name.  I
    think this reads awkwardly with the suggested edit.

    Third, I think the answer may be wrong.  For namelist input, we
    should allow (perhaps we already do) object designators all the
    time, and just not invoke the UDDTIO routine if the object
    designator is not a simple  variable name, or if the resulting
    objects datatype/shape do not match an existing interface for a
    UDDTIO routine.  Also, its not clear to me (its too late in the
    day), but perhaps we really want to allow an object designator
    that's an array element reference to invoke a UDDTIO routine.
    We could use the datatype and shape of the object designator to
    determine whether or not a UDDTIO routine should be invoked
    (still a compile time decision).  I'm not at all sure we'd want
    to allow component references in such a case, or perhaps a
    component reference in the input record just precludes the
    possibility of invoking a UDDTIO routine for that input value.

    The tradeoffs here are:
    1) allow some more functionality (which we may already allow),
       such as array element references appearing in a namelist input
       record (as a namelist group object name, possibly qualified),
       and still cause a UDDTIO routine to be invoked, and

    2) keep the rules simple enough that the user and compiler's I/O
      library can easily agree on what's supposed to happen, and
      what input values are therefore allowed.

    I was going to suggest a replacement edit, but my head hurts too
    much :).

  Well, that gives an easy NO vote on F03/0063 then, since the

  Myself, I believe that the allowance of procedure pointers in
  COMMON was an obvious mistake, made even more obvious by
  16.4.3.1.  Procedure pointers are *procedures*, they are not data
  objects.  Procedures don't take up "storage units".

  Furthermore, constraint C588 prohibits procedure pointers that
  are not subroutines from appearing in COMMON, so F03/0063 is even
  more wrong.  ("A <common-block-object> shall not be ... a function

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

          SUBROUTINE sub(p2)
            IMPORT p

C1212 appears to prohibit the case of an interface name in a procedure
declaration statement being the name of something declared in a later
procedure declaration statement.  But it does not appear to prohibit
the case of an interface name being the name of something declared in
a later interface body.

In the above program, the characteristics of p rely on the
characteristics of sub.  The characteristics of sub, in turn, rely on
the characteristics of p.

Is this program standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this program is not standard-conforming.  The interface name in a
procedure declaration statement should not be permitted to be declared
in a later interface body.  An edit is supplied to correct this
oversight.

  Rob James' NO comment for F03/0064:

    There are some cases of this kind of thing that don't seem to be
   caught by this interpretation response.  In particular, these cases
    don't seem to be prohibited:

    MODULE m1
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s(p)
        PROCEDURE(s) :: p

    Maybe some sort of statement would cover all of these cases if it is
    along the lines that a dummy procedure's characteristics can't
    depend on the characteristics of the procedure or interface body in
    which it is declared.

Given

may

  IF( X .EQ. 0.0 )...
by the processor?

References are to J3/04-007.

7.1.8.3 Evaluation of numeric intrinsic operations has a discussion of
"mathematically equivalent", "mathematical value" and "computational
results".

7.1.8.5 Evaluation of relational intrinsic operations has "Two
relational intrinsic operations are relationally equivalent if their
logical values are equal for all possible values of their primaries."

"values" in that context is ambiguous to me.  Is it the infinite set
of mathematical values or is it the finite set of hardware
representable (computational) values?

My brief scan of F2003 finds that "values" without any adjectives
means what the hardware can represent.

Assuming "values" in 7.1.8.5 means what the hardware can represent,
then I conclude that the transformation cannot be done.  However, Note
7.22 shows "I > J" transformed into "J-I < 0"; which is not true for
the finite set of hardware values (due to undefined behavior of
overflow), but is true for the infinite set of mathematical values.

I believe that "possible values" should be changed to either:
  possible mathematical values
or
  possible computational values

TITLE: Subroutine/function ambiguity in generics
KEYWORDS: subroutine, generic, implicit
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

 Q1. Is the following generic allowed?

     interface q
       subroutine qr(f)
         implicit real(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
       subroutine qc(f)
         implicit complex(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
     end interface q

     The uncertainty arises because it is not established
     whether F is a subroutine or a function. If either F
     were a subroutine, then it would be clear that the
     generic was disallowed. One might be able to use this
     to deduce that both Fs must be functions. This seems
     like an obscure deduction to demand of the compiler.

 Q2. Consider the following "obviously" allowed generic

     module m
       interface q
         subroutine qr(f)
           real, external :: f
         end subroutine
         subroutine qc(f)
           complex, external :: f
         end subroutine
       end interface q
     end module m

     Is the following main program valid?

     program main
       use m
       external ff
       call q(ff)
     end

     Again, the problem is that it is unclear whether or not
     ff is a function or subroutine. If it is a subroutine,
     then the call is ambiguous. One might thus deduce that
     ff must be a function, and therefore of type real,
     but this seems like an obscure deduction to demand of
     the compiler.

ANSWER:

1. The program fragment is not conforming.  A generic interface is
   required to be nonambiguous.  This is a similar situation to the
   declaration of an external procedure in a module, where a
   procedure that is a function is required to have its type and
   type parameters explicitly declared.  An edit is provided to
   require this for specific procedures in a generic interface.

2. The main program program unit is conforming, although the program
   would not be if the external procedure FF were not in fact a real
   function.  If the reference had been to QR instead of Q, it would
   be clear that FF has to be a real function, from the point of view
   of the main program scoping unit.  At the call site, the reference
   to Q is known to be a reference either to QR or QC (the interface
   block for Q is not defective), both of which require a function
   actual argument.  FF is known to be either a subroutine or a
   function, since it explicitly has the EXTERNAL attribute, and if
   it is a function it is known by implicit typing rules to be real.
   Because neither specific in the generic allows a subroutine as an
   argument, FF must therefore be a function.  Since FF is real, QR
   is called.  (The generic cannot have a specific that accepts a
   subroutine as an argument, as that would violate the requirements
   in 16.2.3.)

EDITS:

[261:3] In 12.3.2.1 Interface block,
  immediately after "A generic interface is always explicit.",
  append new sentence to paragraph
    "If a specific procedure in a generic interface has a function
     dummy argument, that argument shall have its type and type
     parameters explicitly declared in the specific interface."
{I.e. if you just say EXTERNAL dummy, you must mean a subroutine.}

TITLE: IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE vs. mathematical equivalence
KEYWORDS: IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE, mathematical equivalence
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Does the function IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE
(Section 14.8) override the mathematical
equivalence rule (Section 7.1.8.3)?

For example, could the program

PROGRAM MAIN
USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC
USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES
X = 2.0 + 2.0
PRINT *, X
END

be executed as

PROGRAM MAIN
USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC
USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES
X = 220.0*(1.0/55.0)
PRINT *, X
END

if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) is .TRUE.?

Background:

The committee recently ruled that 2.0 + 2.0 must produce
the value 4.0 if IEEE_ARITHMETIC is in effect. I agree
that if the particular operation the processor implements
is addition of 2.0 and 2.0, the result must be 4.0.
However, if IEEE_ARITHMETIC does not override the
mathematical equivalence rule, the requirement is essentially
meaningless, since there is no assurance that the expression
in the program is the expression that will be evaluated.

QUESTION:

C1266 requires all nonpointer dummy arguments of a pure function to be
data objects that have INTENT(IN).  C1267 requires all dummy arguments
of a pure subroutine to have specified intents.

Was it intended that VALUE not be allowed in place of INTENT(IN), that
is, was it intended that if a dummy argument of a pure procedure has
the VALUE attribute, it is nonetheless also required to have the
INTENT(IN) attribute explicitly specified?

ANSWER:

The possible extension of the VALUE attribute to allow omission of the
INTENT(IN) attribute in the specific case of pure procedures was not
considered during the development of Fortran 2003.  Nonetheless, the
standard is consistent and not in error, and so this restriction
should remain in Fortran 2003.

QUESTION:

Does the following program unit conform to the 2003 Fortran standard?

  subroutine S ( N )

    character(3) :: c(2)

    data ( c(i)(n:n), i = 1, 2 ) / 'A', 'B' /

  end subroutine s

ANSWER:

No.

A <data-i-do-object> is required to be an <array-element> or a
<structure-component> (see R528 [87:31-32]).

An <array-element> is only a <data-ref> with some extra constraints
(see R616 [107:10]).

A <data-ref> ends with a <part-ref> and does not include a
<substring-range> (see R612 and R613, [105:1-2]).

Therefore c(i)(n:n) is not an array element.
Similarly, a <structure-component> is a <data-ref>, and therefore
c(i)(n:n) is not a structure component either.

Therefore there is a syntax error in the third line of the program unit.

TITLE: IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE in a subroutine

DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Section 7.1.8.1 says that if the value of an
expression can be determined before execution
of the program, it is standard-conforming to use
the predetermined value.

Consider the subprogram

        SUBROUTINE S()
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES

        INTEGER, PARAMETER :: sp = IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND(6,30)
        real(sp) :: X = 0.5559013_sp
        real(sp) :: Y = 1.2092481_sp
        real(sp) :: Z
        IF (IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING(IEEE_NEAREST,X) .AND. &
            IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING(IEEE_UP,X)) THEN
            Z1 = X*Y
            CALL IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE(IEEE_NEAREST)
            Z2 = X*Y
            PRINT *, 'Residual: ', Z1 - Z2
        ENDIF
        END

(1) Is a processor permitted always to print zero for the residual Z1 - Z2 ?
(2) Same question, after giving X and Y the PARAMETER attribute.

ANSWER:

(1) No, for a high quality implementation.
Given that the processor supports execution with both
rounding modes IEEE_NEAREST and IEEE_UP, this subprogram
might be executed in either rounding mode (since the rounding
mode is inherited from the caller, see [367:20-22]), and the value
zero is a bad approximation in the latter case.

No edits are necessary.

(2) Yes.  In this case "X*Y" is an initialization expression,  whose value does
not change from one appearance to the next.

EDITS:

Note 14.6 should note additionally that the value of an
initialization expression is not affected by changes in the rounding mode.

  type(t), pointer :: TV

  call sub ( TV )

The sixth paragraph of 4.5.5.2 [04-007:59:31-32] says "When a procedure is
invoked, a nonpointer nonallocatable object that is an actual argument
associated with an an INTENT(OUT) dummy argument is finalized.''

Is the target of TV finalized with SUB is invoked?

If TV were allocatable instead of a pointer would it be finalized?

ANSWER:

It was intended that an allocatable actual argument or the target of a
pointer actual argument that is associated with an INTENT(OUT) dummy
argument is finalized with the procedure is invoked.  Edits are provided
to correct the error.

Replace the sixth paragraph of 4.5.5.2 [04-007:59:31-32] with the

"When a procedure is invoked, an object that becomes argument associated

Or

"An object that becomes argument associated with a nonpointer

QUESTION:

Does the following subprogram fragment conflict with the 2003 Fortran
standard?  If so, was the conflict intended?

  entry A ( X )

It seems that constraint C1255 in subclause 12.5.2.4 [283:10-12]
prohibits the entry name A to appear in the PROCEDURE statement in
the interface body.  There shouldn't be a problem, however, since
the PROCEDURE statement is in a different scoping unit.

No, this program fragment conforms to the 2003 Fortran standard.

NOTE:

C1255 is pointless because Clause 16 applies.  It could
fruitfully be removed from a future revision of the Fortran standard.

  Jim Xia's NO vote on F03/0090:

    Answer (2) of the interp says an array constructor is
    non-polymorphic with declared type and dynamic type both of T.  I
    see at least four problems with this answer:

    1) There is no requirement anywhere in the standard for RHS
       expression be non-polymorphic in an intrinsic assignment.  The
       array constructor can surely be interpreted as a polymorphic
       array, and the effect is the same as if a polymorphic pointer/
       allocatable array appears as the RHS expression in the
       assignment.  This interpretation will give the same results for
       the assignment.

    2) There are other potential usage of an array constructor
       containing polymorphic entities, such as an actual argument to
       be associated with a polymorphic dummy array, a selector in
       ASSOCIATE or SELECT TYPE construct, a <source-expr> in an
       ALLOCATE statement for a polymorphic pointer/allocatable array.
       It's appropriate to interpret it as a polymorphic array with
       the same declared type and dynamic type as those appearing in
       the array constructor, respectively.

    3) This interpretation prohibits use of unlimited polymorphic data
       in an array constructor because they don't have a declared
       type.  There is no rationale in banning unlimited polymorphic
       entities in an array constructor.

    4) The same effect of obtaining a non-polymorphic array
       constructor can already be achieved by using <type-spec>.

QUESTION:

Is it allowed to change the value of a variable which supplies the
unit number to an read statement?

Page 219:16 says the value of any input/output specifier shall not
depend on any input-item.  If you trace back, the unit= is a specifier
in a READ statement.

Note 9.40 on page 196 gives the example

         READ(N)  N, X(N)

and discusses how the changes in N work.

In F77 the similar example had READ(3).

In Fortran 90 this was changed to READ(N) (on page 126) and was
normative.

In F95 the example was changed to a non-normative note.

The words prohibiting the example usage appear to be new to F03.

ANSWER:

Yes, the example was intended to be allowed.  The restriction on
page 219 is overly restrictive.  Edits will limit the restriction
to "output items" in the specifier list and the Format.  These are
the items that the processor will usually reference during actual
input/output transfers.

228:36-37 describes the output for an IEEE infinity and special cases
field widths of 3 and 8.  But, the special casing doesn't consider the
possibility of a plus or minus sign in the field.  A signed infinity
should be special cased for field widths of 9 and 4.  The current text

and NaN values.

Yes, there is an error in the special cases.  Edits are provided to
correctly describe the required field widths for signed infinities.
An edit is also provided to repair the description of the output of
NaN values.

The minimum field width for output of the form 'Infinity' is 8 if no
sign is produced and 9 otherwise.  If <w> is zero or <w> is less than
the minimum required but large enough to produce the form 'Inf',
the form 'Inf' is output."

  F03/0100 summary of Jim Xia's issues:
    1. The standard puts similar but somewhat different sentences in
       three places, which is inconsistent.  Only one sentence (in
       E editing) is complete while the other two (one for integer
       editing, and one for F editing) are both incomplete.
    2. As to the restriction on output being "NaN" for F editing when
       w == 0, I'm still not convinced it is to the best benefit to

NUMBER: F03/0102
TITLE: Evaluation of bound-expr in data pointer assignment
KEYWORDS: pointer, pointer assignment, bounds, expression
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

DISCUSSION:

Currently there are no rules in 7.4.2.1 to prohibit changing of a
pointer's association status during evaluation of bound expressions
in a data pointer assignment (pointer with either bounds-spec or
bounds-remapping specified).  This may lead to ambiguous code with
regard to the evaluation orders between the bound expression and
the data pointer assignment itself.  Consider the following code,


    integer,  target  :: tar2(100, 100)
    integer,  target  :: tar1(100)
    integer,  pointer :: ptr(:,:)

    ptr(-2:, f1(ptr, tar1, 1, 1):) => tar2

    print*, lbound(ptr)
    print*, ubound(ptr)
    print*, size(ptr)

    contains

    function f1(ptr, arr, i, j)
        integer  :: i, j, f1
        integer, pointer :: ptr(:, :)
        integer, target  :: arr(:)

        ptr (i:j, i:j) => arr
        f1 = -1
    end function

    end

In 7.4.1.3 for interpretation of intrinsic assignments, there are
rules explicitly requesting evaluation of all expressions in variable
occurred before the variable is defined [139:14-19].  It appears that
data pointer assignment should also follow similar rules.

Note the similar problem also exists for evaluating the <data-target>
if it references a function that returns a data pointer.

QUESTION:

    (a) Is this program intended to be standard conforming?

    (b) If it is standard conforming, then what would it print?

ANSWER:

This program does not conform to the Fortran Standard.

The assertion that there are no rules about pointer association status
is false because changes in pointer association status necessarily
cause changes in definition status, as explained in the opening
paragraph of "16.4.2 Pointer association status" which states
  "If a pointer is associated with a target, the definition status
   of the pointer is either defined or undefined, depending on the
   definition status of the target."

The reference to F1(PTR,TAR1,1,1) executes the pointer assignment
PTR(I:J,I:J)=>ARR; this causes its actual argument PTR to become
undefined (using the quoted rule from 16.4.2).

In 7.1.8 paragraph 3, it says
  "If a function reference causes definition or undefinition of
   an actual argument of the function, that argument or any
   associated entities shall not appear elsewhere in the same
   statement."

However, PTR appears elsewhere in that statement (as the base object
of the variable in the assignment), violating this requirement.
Therefore the program is not standard-conforming.

EDITS:

None.

NOTE:

This would be clearer if the undefinition case were also added to the
list of "Events that cause variables to become undefined" in clause
16, e.g.
  "(n) When a pointer becomes associated with a target that is
       undefined, the pointer becomes undefined."
This is recommended for a future revision of the Standard.

TITLE: Restrictions on dummy arguments not present for polymorphic
       type or parameterized derived type
KEYWORDS: dummy argument, present, polymorphic, parameterized derived
          type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

DISCUSSION:

In 12.4.1.6, rules underlying items (7) and (8) (at [04-007:273:7-10]) say
that if a POINTER/ALLOCATABLE optional dummy argument is not present then
it can not be supplied as an actual argument corresponding to an optional
nonpointer/non- allocatable dummy argument.

QUESTION:

Should the reasons underlying items (7) and (8) also apply to the
following two situations:

    1.) a polymorphic optional dummy argument that is not present
    is supplied as an actual argument corresponding to an optional
    non-polymorphic dummy argument;

    2.) a non-present optional dummy argument of derived type with
    an assumed type parameter is supplied as an actual argument
    corresponding to an optional dummy argument that does not have
    the same assumed type parameter

One of the reasons that these rules should apply is that the non-present
dummy argument might be supplied as the actual argument to a procedure
using a different calling convention (pass-by-descriptor to pass-
by-address).

It appears that the current standard overlooked these two cases.  An
edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

ANSWER:

It is intended that these two situations are allowed.  In the first case,
the actual and dummy arguments are required to have the same declared
type, regardless of whether the dummy argument is optional (first
paragraph of subclause 12.4.1.2).

In the second case, the second paragraph of subclause 12.4.1.2 (at
[04-007:269:1-4]) requires the value of the assumed type parameter of the
(absent) actual argument to have the same value as the non-assumed type
parameter of the (absent) dummy argument.  This shouldn't be required.  An
edit is provided to correct this oversight.

EDITS:

Replace the second paragraph of 12.4.1.2 (at [04-007:269:1-4]):

"The type parameter values of the actual argument shall agree with the
corresponding ones of the dummy argument that are not assumed or deferred
unless

  o  the dummy argument is not present (12.4.1.6), or
  o  the actual argument is of type default character and the dummy
     argument is not assumed shape."

    The DISCUSSION is completely irrelevant unless we are talking about
    POINTER/ALLOCATABLE, which we are not.

    I probably disagree with the assertion that these two
    situations "is" or were intended to be allowed.

    The question needs some example code we can say is right or wrong.
    (With some example code maybe I could say whether or not I actually
    agree or disagree with the bold assertion in the ANSWER!)

    The edit makes the following code fragment legal:

       Subroutine one(x)
         Double Precision,Optional :: x
         Call two(x)
       End
      Subroutine two(y)

         ...

    I can categorically state that we definitely did NOT intend this

TITLE: SIZE= specifier and UDDTIO
KEYWORDS: SIZE=, UDDTIO
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

DISCUSSION:

9.5.1.14 [191:21-26] says that when SIZE= specifier is used in a
formatted input statement with explicit format specifications, the
variable specified in the SIZE= specifier is determined by the data
edit descriptors during the input statement.  These rules, however,
did not take into account the following situation where a parent READ
statement with a DT edit descriptor invokes a user-defined DTIO
formatted read subroutine that reads input data using list-directed or
namelist READ statement.

Consider the following example:

module example
    type A
        integer x(10)

        contains

        procedure :: readArray
        generic :: read(formatted) => readArray
    end type

    contains

    subroutine readArray (dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
        class(A), intent(inout) :: dtv
        integer, intent(in) :: unit
        character(*), intent(in) :: iotype
        integer, intent(in) :: v_list(:)
        integer, intent(out) :: iostat
        character(*), intent(inout) :: iomsg

        read (unit, fmt=*, iostat=iostat, iomsg=iomsg) dtv%x
    end subroutine
end module

program test
use example
    type(A) :: v
    integer countChar

    open (1, file='example.input', form='formatted')

    read (1, fmt='(DT)', advance='no', size=countChar) v
end program test


Note that there is no data edit descriptor in the UDDTIO subroutine,
readArray, to count the total number of characters transferred during
the child read.


QUESTION:

    Is this example intended to be standard conforming?

ANSWER:

    No, this example is not standard conforming. SIZE= specifier is
    not allowed in the example presented here.  Edits are provided to
    correct this oversight.

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

The intent was that it would be impossible to reference a deferred
binding.  However, it doesn't appear to me that this intent was achieved.
Consider the following program

  program P
    type, abstract :: T
    contains
      procedure(sub), nopass, deferred :: deferred_proc
    end type T

    call sub

  contains

    subroutine Sub ( X )
      class(t), optional :: X
      call x%deferred_proc
    end subroutine Sub

  end program P

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the standard does it
violate?

Since x%deferred_proc has the NOPASS attribute, this does not require the
value of x (4.5.7) and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore,
the first item in the second list in 12.4.1.2 (at [04-007:272:32-33]) does
not prohibit this.

ANSWER:

This was not intended to be a valid program. A type-bound procedure shall
not be invoked through an absent dummy argument. An edit is supplied to
clarify this situation.

The same flaw is present for procedure pointer component invocation.

TITLE: Is defined assignment to a vector subscripted array allowed?
KEYWORDS: defined assignment, vector-valued subscripts, elemental
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:  Is the assignment statement in subroutine cg1018 standard
conforming?

It does an elemental defined assignment to an array with a vector
valued subscript.  Several compilers reject this assignment,
claiming that an INTENT(OUT) argument can't be associated with
a vector-valued actual argument.

According to 142:6-7, this is a defined elemental assignment.

Lines 26 to 30 of 142 are
"The interpretation of a defined assignment is provided by the
subroutine that defines it.

If the defined assignment is an elemental assignment and the variable
in the assignment is an array, the defined assignment is performed
element-by-element, in any order, on corresponding elements of
variable and expr."

The first line looks like a general definition of defined assignment
and the second line looks like a qualification for the specific case
of elemental assignment.  The qualification has to mean that the
assignments are performed on an element-by-element basis and this
surely must mean that the statement is processed as if it were
expanded into something like

      TLA1L(7) = UDA1R(7)
      TLA1L(1) = UDA1R(1)
      TLA1L(3) = UDA1R(3)
      ...
and then the assignment subroutine is invoked on an
element-by-element basis following the rules in chapter 12.

Page 140, lines 4-5 have essentially identical words for intrinsic
assignment and intrinsic assignment to a vector valued array,
including derived type arrays, is allowed (if not many-to-one).

The processors that reject the test program apparently interpret the
assignment as

       Call U_TO_T( TLA1L(NFV1), (UDA1R))

without doing the assignment on an element-by-element basis.

If that interpretation is correct, then we have the unusual situation
where
      TLA1L(NFV1) = TLA1L
is standard conforming if the assignment is intrinsic and non-standard
if the assignment is defined.

TITLE: attributes allowed for dummy arguments in defined assignments
KEYWORDS: defined assignment, dummy argument, attributes
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

INTRODUCTION:

It seems the standard is quite loose in allowing various attributes
declared for the dummy arguments used in a defined assignment
(7.4.1.4).  In particular, attributes such as POINTER and ALLOCATABLE
can be declared for dummy arguments in the defined assignment.
However the interpretations on their declarations need to be
clarified.

QUESTION:

Consider the follow subroutines (assuming a derived type DT already
defined)

Q1. Are POINTER and ALLOCATABLE attributes allowed for the second
    dummy argument in defined assignment?

    interface ASSIGNMENT (=)
    subroutine defAssgn1 (dt1, dt2)
        type(DT), intent(out) :: dt1
        type(DT), POINTER, intent(in) :: dt2
    end subroutine
    end interface

    In 12.3.2.1.2 [263:10-12], the standard says the following
    "A defined assignment is treated as a reference to the subroutine,
     with the left-hand side as the first argument and the right-hand
     side enclosed in parentheses as the second argument."

    This statement seems to prohibit the use of subroutine defAssgn1
    for defined assignment since a pointer enclosed in parentheses
    refers to its associated target not the pointer itself, as
    indicated by rules in 7.1.4.1 [123:39-124:3].


Q2. Are POINTER and ALLOCATABLE attributes allowed for the first
    dummy argument in defined assignment?

    interface ASSIGNMENT (=)
    subroutine defAssgn2 (dt1, dt2)
        type(DT), POINTER, intent(out) :: dt1
        type(DT), intent(in) :: dt2
    end subroutine
    end interface

    There are no rules in the standard that disallow this declaration.
    However the use of POINTER/ALLOCATABLE attributes on the first
    dummy argument is very doubtful.  Since POINTER/ALLOCATABLE
    attributes don't disambiguate generic declarations(16.2.3), their
    use will prevent the normal declarations of defined assignments,
    wherein dt1 is declared without POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attribute.

ANSWER:

Yes to both questions.  The interface blocks are not defective.  The
standard places very few restrictions on the arguments to defined
assignment subroutines:  [363:6...]

  Each of these subroutines shall have exactly two dummy arguments.
  Each argument shall be nonoptional.  The first argument shall have
  INTENT (OUT) or INTENT (INOUT) and the second argument shall have
  INTENT (IN). ...

Preventing the first argument from having the POINTER attribute
violates F90.

Preventing the second argument from having the ALLOCATABLE attribute
would introduce a prohibition not specified by TR 15581, and might
therefore be viewed as an incompatibility that ought to be announced
in subclause 1.5.

A program couldn't reference defAssgn1 by way of defined assignment
because the right-hand side of a defined assignment is treated as an
expression enclosed in parentheses which would have neither the POINTER
nor the ALLOCATABLE attribute.

A note is provided to draw the readers attention.

EDITS:

At the end of 12.3.2.1.2 insert a new NOTE 12.10+:

"NOTE 12.10+
  If the second argument of a procedure specified in a defined
  assignment interface block has the POINTER of ALLOCATABLE attribute,
  it cannot be accessed by defined assignment, since the right-hand
  side of the assignment is enclosed in parentheses before being
  associated as an actual argument with the second argument.  This
  makes it an expression, which does not have the POINTER or
  ALLOCATABLE attribute."

TITLE: Size and uniqueness considerations for ID=
KEYWORDS: asynchronous I/O, ID=, size
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

The ID= specifier returns an identifier (or "handle") for an async
i/o request.  Must this fit inside the smallest integer kind
supported by the processor?

Consider:
  Integer(Selected_Int_Kind(1)) x(1000)
  Character(80) :: test(1000) = (/ ... /)
  ...
  Do i=1,1000
    Write (17,'(a)',Asynchronous='Yes',Id=x(i)) test(i)
  End Do
  ...
  Do i=1,1000
    Wait (17,Id=x(i))
  End Do

X is only guaranteed to have approximately 20 values available,
and in practice will probably only have 256 such values, so
we are certainly not going to have 1000 unique handles.

Without loss of generality, suppose that one such duplicate value
is 4.  After WAIT(17,ID=4), the async i/o request with ID 4
is no longer pending.  This means that the subsequent WAIT(17,ID=4)
is not conforming to the standard since it requires that the ID=
value is one that is pending.

(1) Is the processor permitted to require a minimum size for ID=
    (e.g. such as default integer)?

Clearly 1000 values do not fit into a 256-valued object, but apart
from that,

(2) Is the processor required to produce unique ID= values for
    each multiple asynchronous i/o operation?

One might conjecture that if the processor returned ID=4 for
two or more async i/o requests on the same unit, the first WAIT
for ID=4 would wait for the first such async i/o request and the
second one would wait for the second such async i/o request.

(3) Does WAIT-ing on an ID= value wait for all async i/o operations
    that have that as the handle, or are these queued up?

Unlike other i/o-related specifiers, there does not seem to be any
constraint on the value returned for ID= (such as being non-zero
or non-negative).  In the case of the i/o being completed
synchronously, there does not appear to be any way of returning
a "non-handle" to the user program (one might have conjectured that
zero was not a handle, but this is not supported by the text of
the standard).

(4) Was there intended to be a "non-handle" return for ID=?

DISCUSSION:

It is understood that resource considerations may limit the number
of outstanding asynchronous i/o requests, but 19 (the limit implied
by the minimum-size integer that follows the model in c13) seems
awfully small; for that matter 256 seems pretty small for todays
operating systems.

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, the standard should require the ID= specifier to be default
    integer or bigger.  An edit is provided.

(2) Yes, all pending data transfer operation identifiers on a
    particular unit are required to be unique.  An edit is provided
    to clarify this.

(3) ID= values are required to be unique, so this question does not
    arise.

(4) Yes, the value zero should not be a handle but an indication the
    request was completed synchronously.  An edit is provided to add
    this.

TITLE: Inconsistent restrictions on i/o specifiers
KEYWORDS: I/O specifier, default logical
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

All of the i/o specifiers that return INTEGER values permit any kind
of integer to be used, even though this is likely to cause problems
with small integers.  But all of the i/o specifiers that return
LOGICAL values require "full-size" (default) logical variables, even
though every kind of LOGICAL can represent every LOGICAL value,
viz .TRUE. and .FALSE..

Should these be consistent, i.e. should every kind of LOGICAL be
allowed for EXIST=, NAMED=, OPENED=, and PENDING=?

ANSWER:

Yes, these should have been consistent.  Edits are provided.

         END SUBROUTINE
       END

Is this program standard conforming?

ANSWER:  Section 16.2.3 of the Fortran 2003 standard appears to forbid
the presence of such conflicting interfaces.   Section 12.4.4
clearly is written to allow for such conflicting interfaces, but
there is nothing in that section that modifies the sense of
Section 16.3.2.  The question then becomes, do the rules of 16.3.2
apply only to explicitly declared procedures and to procedures made
accessible through use association, or also to those accessible
through host association?

The committee concludes that the rules of 16.3.2 apply also to
procedures accessible through host association.  An edit is proposed
to make this clear.   Although some of the
language in 12.4.4.1 could therefore be simplified, it is still useful
for processors which extend the standard by relaxing some of the rules
in 16.3.2 and there is no reason why it should not remain normative.
A NOTE could be added to this section.

within a scoping unit by every pair of specific procedures that have
the same generic identifier, whether the specific procedures are

or in a module used by the scoping unit."

At [04-007.pdf:278:5+] add

NOTE: In a standard conforming processor which has not extended
(i.e. relaxed) the rules laid out in Section 16.3.2 for pairs of
specific procedures, the above rules can be effectively replaced
by the somewhat simpler rule

-----------------------------------------------------------
(*) Consider the set of specific interfaces of a generic interface
    that has that name and is in the unit in which the reference
    appears together with specific interfaces of a generic interface
    made accessible by a USE statement in the scoping unit.  If the
    scoping unit has a host scoping unit and the name is established
    to be generic in that host scoping unit, then additionally
    include in the considered set the specific interfaces of the
    generic interface in the host scoping unit (regardless of whether
    the name is accessible in the scoping unit).  If the scoping unit
    contains an INTRINSIC attribute specification for that name or a
    USE statement that makes that name accessible from a module in
    which the corresponding name is specified to have the INTRINSIC
    attribute, then additionally include in the considered set the
    interfaces of this intrinsic procedure.

    Then if the reference is consistent with a nonelemental reference
    to one of the procedures in the set, the reference is to that
    specific procedure.  Failing that, if the reference is consistent
    with an elemental reference to one of the procedures in the set,
    the reference is to that specific procedure.

    In each case the rules in 16.2.3 ensure that at most one such
    specific procedure is specified.

TITLE: STOP executed via function in input/output list
KEYWORDS: STOP
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

Interpretation F90/000209 considered the question
    Section 9.7.  May a function referenced in an I/O statement
    execute a STOP or PAUSE statement?  If STOP statements are
    permitted, what is the state of the file at the end of
    execution?

The answer (w.r.t. STOP), included in F95 corrigendum 2, replied
    No, a STOP statement may not be executed in this situation.
    Executing a STOP statement causes normal termination of
    execution, which closes all files (9.3.5), and this is equivalent
    to executing a CLOSE statement, which is prohibited by 9.7.  A
    clarifying edit is supplied.

However, on further consideration of the reasoning behind this answer,
it seems unhelpful to rule out STOP, which is often used for user
signalling of error conditions, during i/o operations.  For one thing,
if the data transfer statement being executed is READ, the question
about file state has a very straightforward answer.  It might also be
considered unhelpful in the WRITE case for STOP to cause the user's
entire file system to be potentially reformatted instead of just
making the contents of the relevant file undefined.

Furthermore, the user who wants to signal an error can cause error
termination via one of the "approved" methods such as DEALLOCATE of an
unallocated array.  It seems less than unhelpful to force the user to
use such a circumlocution simply for standards conformance, and the
question about file state can equally be asked of this situation.

Q1. Is execution of a STOP statement during internal i/o allowed?

Q2. Is execution of a STOP statement during a READ statement allowed?

Q3. Is execution of a STOP statement during a WRITE statement allowed?

Q4. What is the effect on the file state of executing the following
    code fragment during a WRITE statement to an external file:

      REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: array(:)
      DEALLOCATE(array)

    (And if the answer to Q3 is yes, does a STOP statement have the
    same effect.)

ANSWER:

The answer to the first three questions is yes, this should have been
allowed.  An edit is provided to correct the standard.

The answer to Q4 is that the effects on the file currently being
written by that WRITE statement are not standardised.  (This was, in
fact, the situation before the adoption of the previous interp
answer.)  A clarifying edit is provided to indicate that the contents
of the file become undefined.

EDITS:

[195:23+]
In 9.5.3 "Execution of a data transfer input/output statement",

  "If execution of the program is terminated during execution of a

   undefined."

TITLE: Are lower bounds of assumed-shape arrays assumed?
KEYWORDS: LBOUND, assumed-shape array, initialization expression
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum

QUESTION:

Does the following program conform to the 2003 Fortran standard?

  subroutine S ( A )
    integer :: A(:,3:)
    integer, parameter :: R = size(lbound(A))
  end subroutine S

Processors disagree.  If the lower bounds of an assumed-shape array
are assumed, LBOUND(A) is not an initialization expression according
to item (8)(b)(i) in subclause 7.1.7.  If the lower bounds of an
assumed-shape array are not assumed, LBOUND(A) is an initialization
expression in this case, but might be a specification expression in
other cases.

ANSWER:

This program conforms to the 2003 Fortran standard.  The lower bounds
of an assumed-shape array are not assumed.  If a lower bound is not
specified, it has the value 1 -- see the final sentence of the final
paragraph of subclause 5.1.2.5.2.  If a lower bound is specified, it
must be specified either by an initialization expression or a
specification expression.  In the example in the question, the lower
bound of the first dimension is omitted, and therefore has the value
1, while the lower bound of the second dimension is given by an
initialization expression.  Therefore, the reference to LBOUND is an
initialization expression, and the reference to SIZE is therefore an
initialization expression.

EDITS:

Before the last sentence of the final paragraph of 5.1.2.5.2, insert
a sentence: "The lower bounds of an assumed-shape array are not
assumed."

TITLE: Elemental procedures and deferred length character components
KEYWORDS: deferred length, elemental
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Constraint C1279 says
  "In the scoping unit of an elemental subprogram, an object
   designator with a dummy argument as the base object shall not
   appear in a <specification-expr> except as the argument to one of
   the intrinsic functions BIT_SIZE, KIND, LEN, or the numeric inquiry
   functions (13.5.6)."

It has been stated in previous J3 papers that the reason for this
restriction is to ensure that every iteration of a single invocation
of an elemental procedure will have the same stack size: and this
desire was achieved in Fortran 95.

However, the situation changes with deferred-length character
components.  For example, with the type
  TYPE T
    CHARACTER(:),ALLOCATABLE :: CP
  END TYPE
and the elemental procedure
  SUBROUTINE ZAP(X)
    TYPE(T),INTENT(INOUT) :: x
    REAL WORK(LEN(X%CP))
    ...
and the variable
  TYPE(T) ARRAY(100)
initialized as
  DO I=1,100; ARRAY(I)%CP = REPEAT('x',I); END DO
then in the invocation
  CALL ZAP(ARRAY)
the invoked procedure will have a different size for its WORK array
for every element of ARRAY.  Thus the restriction no longer achieves
its aim (though this aim is not actually stated in the standard).

Is this restriction still correct and useful?  That is,
(a) is the above example standard-conforming,
(b) is the below example standard-conforming.

Program below_example
  Integer :: ARRAY(100) = (/ (I,I=1,100) /)
  Call ES(ARRAY)
  Print *,ARRAY
Contains
  Elemental Subroutine ES(X)
    Integer,Intent(Inout) :: X
    Real WORK(X)
    ...
  End Subroutine
End Program

ANSWER:

Although the restriction is not as useful as before, the standard is not
in error.  The first example is standard-conforming (as per the quoted
text) but the second is not, because it violates constraint C1279.

EDITS:

None.

TITLE: When are parameterized sequence types the same type?
KEYWORDS: type parameter, sequence type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

(1) What does 4.5.1.3 mean by the phrase "have type parameters
and components that agree in order, name, and attributes?"
Does

      REAL A(2*N)

"agree" with

      REAL A(N+N) ?

Does

      REAL A(N*N)

"agree" with

      REAL A(N**2) ?

(2) How complicated can the expressions a processor must
determine are equal or different be?

DISCUSSION:

The Fortran 2003 standard allows sequence types to have type
parameters (4.5.1, 4.5.1.2).  The Fortran 2003 standard also
gives rules for deciding when two entities declared with
reference to derived-type definitions have the same
type (4.5.1.3).  Those rules break down for parameterized
sequence types.

Although the Fortran 2003 standard does not explicitly say
it, the standard assumes that two attributes that include
one or more expressions agree only if the values of those
expressions are the same.  Previous standards used
attributes with expressions that could not be evaluated
statically only in contexts where the processor was not
required to determine if those attributes agreed.  The
inclusion of parameterized sequence types has created
situations where it is necessary for the processor to
determine if such attributes agree.

QUESTION:

(3) Consider the modules

       MODULE M1
         TYPE T(N)
           INTEGER(KIND=4), KIND :: N
           SEQUENCE
           REAL A(2*N)
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T(4)) :: X
       END

       MODULE M2
         TYPE T(N)
           INTEGER(KIND=4), KIND :: N
           SEQUENCE
           REAL A(N+N)
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T(4)) :: Y
       END

Are the variables X and Y in this example of the same
type?

(4) What if the two instances of the type parameter N
in the previous example were not kind type parameters?

(5) Consider the modules

       MODULE M1
         INTERFACE S
           SUBROUTINE S1(X, M)
             TYPE T(N)
               INTEGER :: N
               SEQUENCE
               REAL A(N+N)
             END TYPE
             TYPE(T(M)) :: X
           END SUBROUTINE
         END INTERFACE
         TYPE T(N)
           INTEGER :: N
           SEQUENCE
           REAL A(N+N)
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T(2)) :: X
       END

       MODULE M2
         INTERFACE S
           SUBROUTINE S2(X, M)
             TYPE T(N)
               INTEGER :: N
               SEQUENCE
               REAL A(2*N)
             END TYPE
             TYPE(T(M)) :: X
           END SUBROUTINE
         END INTERFACE
         TYPE T(N)
           INTEGER :: N
           SEQUENCE
           REAL A(2*N)
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T(2)) :: X
       END

If these two modules are used in the same scoping unit
and there is a CALL of the generic subroutine S in that
scoping unit, does the Fortran 2003 standard
require a conforming processor to detect and report
the conflict with the rules given in 16.2.3?  It seems
it might or might not  depending
on one's interpretation of item (6) in 1.5.

DISCUSSION:

Some have suggested that two attributes that include
expressions should be said to agree if and only if the
corresponding expressions are equivalent.  One problem
with that notion is that in general the question of
whether two expressions are equivalent is undecidable.
That problem could be circumvented by restricting the
forms of expressions allowed.  For example, the
expressions might be restricted to be polynomials of
one or more variables.  In that case, the problem of
determining equivalence is merely intractable, not
impossible.

Some have suggested that the notion of requiring only
that the values agree should be maintained.  One
consequence of that would be that some constraint
violations that are can currently be detected
statically could only be detected dynamically.
For example, consider the program

      MODULE M1
        TYPE T(N)
          INTEGER(KIND=4) :: N
          SEQUENCE
          REAL A(N+N)
        END TYPE
      END

      MODULE M2
        TYPE T(N)
          INTEGER(KIND=4) :: N
          SEQUENCE
          REAL A(N*N)
        END TYPE
      END

      SUBROUTINE S(N)
        USE M1, T1=>T
        USE M2, T2=>T
        TYPE(T(N)) :: X
        TYPE(T(N)) :: Y
        Y%A = 0.0
        X = Y
      END

      PROGRAM MAIN
        READ *, N
        CALL S(N)
      END

Under the interpretation requiring equal values, the
question of whether the processor must detect and
report a constraint violation in the assignment X = Y
cannot be determined until the value of N is known.

Another suggestion was that attributes that include
expressions agree if and only if they are textually
equivalent.  That opens up the question of what it
means to say that two expressions are textually
equivalent.  Does whitespace count?  Is "2"
textually equivalent to "02"?  It "2" textually
equivalent to a named constant "TWO" whose value is
two?

Another suggestion was that two entities declared
with reference to derived-type definitions in different
scoping units should be considered to be of different
if either or both of the derived-type definitions
include type parameters.  At least that solution is
easy to specify.

Parameterized sequence types add so little value to the
Fortran language that they cannot be worth the trouble
they cause for the language specification, for
implementors, and, if there are any users, for users.
Therefore, I suggest banning parameterized sequence
types from the language.  Implementations that
currently support parameterized sequence types can
continue to support them due to the permissive nature
of the Fortran standard.

ANSWER:

It was not intended that parameterized derived
types participate in the algorithm for determining when
two types are the same, as given in section 4.5.1.3.
Therefore the answers to the questions are:
Not Applicable, Not Applicable, No, Still No, and No.

To make this effective, edits are supplied which ban
parameterized sequence types from the language.

KEYWORDS: REAL intrinsic
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Must the intrinsic function REAL with KIND parameter wp return a value
that is a REAL (KIND=wp) floating point number?

RATIONALE FOR THE QUESTION:

Computer hardware may use a wider floating-point format for registers
than for memory; e.g., 80 bits for registers and 64 bits for memory
for the case of standard double precision floating point numbers.
Some algorithms require a high level of control over floating point
semantics.  If the intrinsic function REAL with KIND parameter wp is
guaranteed to return a REAL (KIND=wp) result then a programmer can use
this to force intermediate results into main memory format, never mind
that the optimizing compiler may have placed the intermediate in a
register.

I am interested in a J3 interpretation of this matter, especially a
loud and clear affirmative interpretation, because it appears that
some present Fortran compilers optimize away my explicit use of the
REAL intrinsic.  The context is code for compensated summation (Kahan
summation).  I appreciate that parentheses are inviolable courtesy of
the Fortran standard, but in order to have code that cannot be broken
by an optimizing compiler I seem to need also a language mechanism to
force intermediate results into main memory format.

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

       MODULE MOD
         TYPE, PRIVATE :: T
           SEQUENCE
           INTEGER :: I
         END TYPE

       PROGRAM MAIN
         USE MOD
         CALL S
         X = Y
       END

The first sentence of subclause 4.5.1.3 of the 2003 Fortran standard
says the program conforms because the objects X and Y have the same
type, because they are declared by reference to the same type
definition.  The last sentence of that subclause says they do not
have the same type because the type definition is declared to be
PRIVATE.

Does the program conform to the 2003 Fortran standard?

If not, which assignment statement causes the program not to conform?

ANSWER:

The program conforms to the 2003 Fortran standard.

ANALYSIS:

The determination that an object cannot have the same type as another
one that is declared by reference to a type that is declared to be
PRIVATE cannot possibly refer to an object declared in a scope where
the type is not accessible.  Therefore the objects must be declared
in scopes where the type is accessible.  It is irrelevant whether the
type is "declared to be PRIVATE" in that scope, because accessibility
attributes determine whether a name is accessible in a different
scope.

It would be absurd if the assignment statement in the module
subprogram were not standard conforming.  Given that it must be
standard conforming, it would be absurd if the assignment statement
in the main program were not standard conforming.

Edits are provided to clarify this conclusion.

In subclause 4.5.1.3 [47:11], remove "declared to be PRIVATE or"
from the last sentence.

TITLE: 	Implicit typing in derived types
KEYWORDS: Derived types, implicit typing
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

This is from Robert Corbett via f08 PC J32026 a/k/a 08-240.
AT 185, 08-240r1 suggested making this an Interp.  Done herewith.

Consider the program

       PROGRAM MAIN
         TYPE T
           INTEGER :: I = BIT_SIZE(J)
         END TYPE
         CALL SUBR1
       CONTAINS
         SUBROUTINE SUBR1
           J = 1
           CALL SUBR2
           PRINT *, J
         END SUBROUTINE
         SUBROUTINE SUBR2
           J = 2
         END SUBROUTINE
       END

This program prints either 1 or 2 depending on the
implementation with which it is compiled.  Some
implementations implicitly declared J in the
top-level scope of the main program.  Some declare
J in the scope of the derived type definition, which
is semantic nonsense, but there you have it.

ANSWER:

Paragraph 4 of Section 5.5 of the Fortran 2008 draft
states

     The data entity is treated as if it were
     explicitly declared in the outermost scoping
     unit in which it appears.

The derived type definition is the outermost scoping
unit in which the occurrence of J in the derived type
definition appears, but an explicit definition of J
is not allowed in that context.

The simple solution for this problem is to ban implicit
typing in derived type definitions.

TITLE: definition is poorly defined
KEYWORDS: definition
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the program:

       PROGRAM MAIN
         TYPE T1
           SEQUENCE
           INTEGER I, J
         END TYPE
         TYPE T2
           SEQUENCE
           INTEGER I, J
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T1) X, Y
         EQUIVALENCE (I, X, Y)
         X%J = 2
         I = 1
         PRINT *, I, X, Y
       END

The assignment to the variable I causes I, X, and Y
to become defined (see items (1) and (15) of
Section 16.6.5).  Therefore, according to item (1)
of Section 16.6.6, I, X, and Y become undefined.

ANSWER:

Item (1) of Section 16.6.6 should be modified so that
it directly applies only to ultimate components.  The
effect on aggregate types will then occur as is
appropriate because of the rules given in
Section 16.6.1.

TITLE: Definitions of EXTENDS_TYPE_OF and SAME_TYPE_AS
KEYWORDS: EXTENDS_TYPE_OF SAME_TYPE_AS
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

The arguments of EXTENDS_TYPE_OF and SAME_TYPE_AS are required to
be of extensible type. Does this restriction apply to the declared
type, the dynamic type, or both?

ANSWER:

This restriction was intended to apply to the dynamic type; this is
clear from the existing text.  However, the restriction is stronger
than required or useful, and so an edit is supplied to weaken it.


DISCUSSION:

For EXTENDS_TYPE_OF, this is clear from the Result Value paragraph
which explicitly specifies the result when either the A or MOLD
argument to the intrinsic is unlimited polymorphic.

For SAME_TYPE_AS, this is clear from Note 13.17 which explains how to
work out the result when one or both arguments is a disassociated
pointer (or unallocated allocatable), including that of an unlimited
polymorphic entity.

However, in the case of unlimited polymorphic, it is unreasonable to
require the program to somehow know that the dynamic type is
extensible; these functions should return the right result whenever
either argument is of extensible type, and otherwise it should be
processor dependent, i.e. the restriction should be weakened.

EDITS:

[316:16-17] In 13.7.38, EXTENDS_TYPE_OF, arguments A and MOLD,
  after "of extensible"
  change "type" to "declared type or unlimited polymorphic",
  twice.

[316:21] Change the last "otherwise" to
         "if the dynamic type of A or MOLD is extensible,".

[316:22] At the end of the sentence insert
         "; otherwise the result is processor dependent".

[347:30,348:1] In 13.7.101, SAME_TYPE_AS, arguments A and B,
  after "of extensible"
  change "type" to "declared type or unlimited polymorphic",
  twice.

[348:3] Change "The"
        to "If the dynamic type of A or B is extensible, the"
[348:4] Append new sentence to paragraph
        "If neither A nor B have extensible dynamic type, the
         result is processor dependent."

TITLE: References to VOLATILE variables in pure procedures
KEYWORDS: VOLATILE, PURE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Was it intended to allow a VOLATILE variable to be referenced
in a pure procedure?

ANSWER:

No.  It was intended that the result of invoking a pure function in a
FORALL assignment statement should never depend on the order in which
the invocations are executed, see NOTE 12.44.  The value of a variable
with the VOLATILE attribute might change between invocations of the
function in ways incompatible with this design.

EDIT:

[286:22+] In 12.6, Pure procedures, add a new constraint:

  "C1271a The <designator> of a variable with the VOLATILE attribute
          shall not appear in a pure subprogram."

TITLE: Duration of procedure execution
KEYWORDS: argument association, procedure
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

In the following questions, the following type definition and procedure
are assumed:

  TYPE T
    INTEGER :: C = 17
  END TYPE

  SUBROUTINE S(A,B)
    TYPE(T),INTENT(IN) :: A
    TYPE(T),INTENT(OUT) :: B
    ...
  END

(1) Consider

  TYPE(T) X
  X%C = 3
  CALL S(X,X)

Q1. Is this valid, and if so, is A%C equal to 3 or 17?

Discussion: B is default-initialized "on invocation", and A is not
  permitted to be changed "during execution", so this depends on
  whether "during execution" was intended to include the process of
  invocation.

(2) Consider

  TYPE(T) X
  X%C = 3
  CALL S(F(),X)

where F is the internal function

  TYPE(T) FUNCTION F()
    F = X
  END FUNCTION

Q2. Is this valid?  If so, what is the value of B%C (3 or 17)?

Discussion: The reference to procedure F is not permitted to "affect
  or be affected by the evaluation of any other entity within the
  statement" (7.1.8 paragraph 3).  However, X is not being affected by
  "evaluation" (it is not being evaluated by becoming argument-associated
  with dummy argument A).  A becomes defined "on invocation" of S and it
  is not clear whether that precedes argument evaluation or not.

(3) Consider

  SUBROUTINE V(AA,BB)
    TYPE(T),VALUE :: AA
    TYPE(T),INTENT(OUT) :: BB
    ...
  END

  TYPE(T) X
  X%C = 3
  CALL V(X,X)

Q3. Is this valid?  If so, what is the value of AA%C (3 or 17)?

Discussion: AA gets its value by argument association, so happens at the
  same time as the definition of BB (which defines the actual argument).
  It is not clear what the semantics are here.

Q4. It is similarly unclear as to what is or is not permitted during
    invocation of a procedure when an actual argument might be modified
    by some other activity, for example if it has the VOLATILE or
    ASYNCHRONOUS attribute.

ANSWER:

The standard does not unambiguously supply an interpretation of these, and
therefore they are invalid by subclause 1.5, first sentence.  Edits are
supplied to clarify this.

EDITS:

[81:15] 5.1.2.7, paragraph beginning "The INTENT(IN)",
  change "during the execution"
  to "during the invocation and execution".
{Makes example 1 clearly invalid, and makes it clear that INTENT(IN)
 variables are unchanged from the start of invocation.}

[81:26] Append to the INTENT(OUT) paragraph
  "Any undefinition or definition implied by association of an actual
   argument with an INTENT(OUT) dummy argument shall not affect any other
   entity within the statement that invokes the procedure."
{Makes examples 2 and 3 clearly invalid.}

[275:2,5] Change "during the execution"
  To "during the invocation and execution",
  Twice.
{Makes it clear that the anti-aliasing rules apply for the whole process
 of procedure invocation and execution, not just the execution part.}
