NUMBER: F08/0002
TITLE: Are assumed- or deferred-shape objects allowed in namelist?
KEYWORDS: assumed-shape, deferred-shape, namelist
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

At [10-007:111:19-23 5.6p5] it says

        A namelist group object shall either be accessed by use or host
        association or shall have its type, type parameters, and shape
        specified by previous specification statements or the procedure
        heading in the same scoping unit or by the implicit typing rules
        in effect for the scoping unit.

Because "type parameters, and shape" appears, is the following
conforming?

  real, allocatable :: A(:)
  real, pointer :: B(:)
  character(len=:), allocatable :: C
  namelist /N/ A, B, C

DISCUSSION:

The wording of 5.6p5 is a result of not completely finishing the
replacement of the constraint at [97-007r2:66:1-4 5.4]:

        A <namelist-group-object> shall not be an array dummy argument
        with nonconstant bound, a variable with nonconstant character
        length, an automatic object, a pointer, a variable of a type
        that has an ultimate component that is a pointer, or an
        allocatable array.

by [04-007:95:10 5.4 C574] which became [09-007r3:111:10 5.6 C585]:

C585 (R564) A <namelist-group-object> shall not be an assumed-size
     array.

ANSWER:

It was intended that the above conform.  Edits are supplied to clarify
this.

EDITS to 10-007:

In the first sentence of [111:19 5.6p5], replace "type parameters,
and shape" by "kind type parameters, and rank".
