1. Introduction

There are a couple of Fortran 2008 new features that were not mentioned in
the Introduction, even after Corrigendum 4.

We should consider having an Annex C subclause which lists such things.
Perhaps we should even include the things that were listed in the Intro?

2. Edits to 16-007r1

[somewhere] Insert new subclause
  "C.n Fortran 2008 features not mentioned in the Introduction

   The following features were new in Fortran 2008 but not originally
   listed in its Introduction as being new features:

   - An array or object with a nonconstant length type parameter can have
     the VALUE attribute.

   - Multiple allocations are permitted in a single ALLOCATE statement
     with SOURCE=.

   - A PROCEDURE statement can have a double colon before the first
     procedure name.

   - An argument to a pure procedure can have default INTENT if it has
     the VALUE attribute.

   - The PROTECTED attribute can be specified by the procedure
     declaration statement.

   - A \si{defined-operator} can be used in a specification expression.

   - A procedure that is not a procedure pointer can be an actual argument
     that corresponds to a procedure pointer dummy argument with the
     INTENT (IN) attribute.

  All but the last of the above list were subsequently added to the
  Introduction by Technical Corrigenda."
