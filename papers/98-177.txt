Subject:  Interp. question on pointer function result passed to INTENT(OUT)

NUMBER:
TITLE: Association of pointer function result with INTENT(OUT) dummy argument
KEYWORDS: Pointer association, dummy argument association, intent attribute
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:  Consider the following program.

      PROGRAM P
        INTEGER, TARGET :: T

        CALL SUB(FPTR())
      CONTAINS
        FUNCTION FPTR()
          INTEGER, POINTER :: FPTR

          FPTR => T
        END FUNCTION FPTR
        SUBROUTINE SUB(IO)
          INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: IO

          IO = 17
        END SUBROUTINE SUB
      END PROGRAM P

According to 12.4.1 [200:30-32],

    "If a dummy argument is not a pointer and the corresponding actual
     argument is a pointer, the actual argument shall be currently
     associated with a target and the dummy argument becomes argument
     associated with that target."

According to 12.4.1 [201:19-21],

    "If a dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT), the actual
     argument shall be definable."

According to 5.1.2.3 [53:29-31],

    "The INTENT(OUT) attribute specifies that. . . any actual argument
     that becomes associated with such a dummy argument shall be
     definable."

The definition of "definable" supplied in Annex A (the term does not appear
to be defined in normative text) is:

    "A variable is <<definable>> if its value may be changed by the
     appearance of its <name> or <designator> on the left of an
     <assignment statement>."

According to this definition, "definable" is a property of variables only.
In the example above, the actual argument is not a variable.  However, the
actual argument is pointer associated with an object that is definable.
The text cited from 5.1.2.3 refers to the "actual argument that becomes
associated with the dummy argument", but the first piece of text cited from
12.4.1 makes it clear that when the actual argument is a pointer, it is
the target with which it is associated that becomes argument associated
with the dummy argument, and not the actual argument itself.

Was it the intent of the committee that this program should not be
standard-conforming?
