1. Introduction

There is no complete definition an implicit interface.  It consists of
"not an explicit interface."  The definition in 3.89 is only an
incomplete list of two of the three properties of an incomplete interface
for functions (it doesn't include its name, which is part of the
interface according to 15.4.1), and does not mention implicit interface
for subroutines.

[15:9 3.89 "implicit interface" p1]
{The definition of implicit interface is an interface that is "not an
 explicit interface".  The properties of implicit interface do not need
 to be listed as part of the definition.  Another paper might move the
 definition.}
Replace

"interface of a procedure that ... (15.4.2, 15.4.3.9)"

with

"interface of a procedure that is not an explicit interface (15.4.2,
 15.4.3.9)".
