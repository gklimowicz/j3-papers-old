Subject: F_C_STRING when C_CHAR is -1
Date: 2021-February-22

Reference: 21-007, 20-141r1

UTI-017 requested clarification for the new module intrinsic procedure
C_F_STRPOINTER when the processor does not support a C character kind,
and thus the named constant C_CHAR from intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING
has the value -1. The same question applies to F_C_STRING. This paper
proposes an edit for F_C_STRING similar to the one approved for
C_F_STRPOINTER.

Edit to 21-007
--------------

492:26+ [18.2.3.9p5+ F_C_STRING]

Add a paragraph:

"If C_CHAR has the value -1, indicating that there is no C character 
kind, the generic function F_C_STRING does not have any specific 
procedure."
