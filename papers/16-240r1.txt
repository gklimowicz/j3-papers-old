Reference: 16-007r2

In 16.9.59 DATE_AND_TIME, the TIME= has a faux pas.

Two consecutive sentences:

1. It is assigned a value of the form /hhmmss.sss/, where . . .

2. The characters of this value shall all be decimal digits.

Assuming we are not attempting to reclassify . as a decimal digit,
I suggest the repair below.

Note that in the ZONE= description, the language is careful to say
that following the sign character the characters shall be
decimal digits.

{against 16-007r2}

Edits in 16.9.59 DATE_AND_TIME, the TIME= description [376:35-38]

[376:37] Change the sentence
"The characters of this value shall all be decimal digits."
to
"Except for the decimal point, the characters of this value
shall all be decimal digits."

{repair silliness}
