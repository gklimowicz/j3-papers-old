Discussion:
-----------

Paper 22-116 proposes a change to the procedure C_F_POINTER in the
ISO_C_BINDING module to add an optional argument, LEN, that can be
used to specify LEN type parameters for the argument FPTR in the event
that FPTR is a parameterized derived type. An interoperable derived
type is not allowed to have type parameters (C1802 in 22-007,
subclause 18.3.4), so in the context of an intrinsic in the
iso_c_binding module, this seems like an inappropriate change. 

Irrespective of the merits of the proposal, now that the CD for F202x
has been completed, the window for new features is closed. The
proposal in 22-116 is judged to be a sufficiently significant change
to constitute a new feature. Therefore, subgroup recommends No Action
for this paper at m226 of PL22.3.  Feature proposals deemed as too
late for F202x can be submitted for consideration in a future
revision.
