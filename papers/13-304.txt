[Introduction p2+]

In the new list of new features, add

  o Scoping units:
    The IMPORT statement can appear in any contained scoping unit, and
    control whether to access some, none, or all of the names from the
    host scoping unit by host association.

[12.4.3.3 282:2] Replace R1209:

R1209 <import-stmt> <<is>> IMPORT [[ :: ] <import-name-list> ]
                    <<or>> IMPORT, ONLY : <import-name-list>
                    <<or>> IMPORT, NONE
                    <<or>> IMPORT, ALL

[12.4.3.3 282:3-4] Replace C1210:

C1210 (R1209) An IMPORT statement shall not appear within the
      <specification-part> of a <main-program>, <external-subprogram>,
      <module>, or <block-data>.

[12.4.3.3 282:5+] Add constraints:

C1211a (R1209) If IMPORT, ONLY appears, all IMPORT statements in the
       scoping unit where the <import-stmt> appears shall specify
       IMPORT, ONLY.

C1211b (R1209) IMPORT, NONE shall not appear in a submodule.

C1211c (R1209) If IMPORT, ONLY appears in a submodule, every
       <procedure-name> in every MODULE PROCEDURE statement in that
       submodule shall appear in an <import-name-list> in that
       submodule.

C1211d (R1209) If IMPORT, NONE or IMPORT, ALL appears, no other IMPORT
       statement shall appear in the scoping unit where the
       <import-stmt> appears.

C1211e (R1209) Within an interface body, an entity that is made
       accessible by an <import-stmt> and is accessed by host
       association shall be accessible by host or use association within
       the host scoping unit, or explicitly defined or declared prior to
       the interface body.

C1211f (R1209) The name of an entity made accessible by an <import-stmt>
       shall not appear, within the scoping unit where the <import-stmt>
       appears, in a context described in 16.5.1.4 that causes the host
       entity of that name to be inaccessible.

[12.4.3.3p1-2 282:6-15] Replace paragraphs 1-2:

IMPORT, ONLY statements specify that only those entities named in
<import-name-list>s in the scoping unit where the <import-stmt>s appear
are accessible by host association within that scoping unit.

An IMPORT, NONE statement specifies that no entities in the host scoping
unit are accessible by host association within the scoping unit where
the <import-stmt> appears.  This is the default for an interface body
for an external or dummy procedure.

An IMPORT, ALL statement specifies that all entities from the host
scoping unit are accessible by host association within the scoping unit
where the <import-stmt> appears.

An IMPORT statement with no <import-name-list> specifies that each host
entity not named in an IMPORT statement is also made accessible by host
association within the scoping unit where the <import-stmt> appears if
its name does not appear in a context described in 16.5.1.4 that causes
the host entity of that name to be inaccessible.  This is the default
for a nested scoping unit other than an interface body for  an external
or dummy procedure.

An IMPORT statement with an <import-name-list> specifies that the named
entities from the host scoping unit are accessible by host association
within the scoping unit where the <import-stmt> appears.

[16.5.1.4p1 443:27-31] Replace the first three sentences:

A nested scoping unit has access to named entities from its host as
specified by \ref{D12: IMPORT statement}.
