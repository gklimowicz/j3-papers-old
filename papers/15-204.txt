Discussion
----------

The restriction in F2008 13.5 at 329:1-3 in 14-007r2 reads

"The effects of calling COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE,
GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, and GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE on any
image other than image 1 are processor dependent."

With the introduction of teams, the ambiguity would apply to images
other than image 1 of the initial team, leaving some teams with no
access at all. Additionally, the limitations for COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT,
GET_COMMAND, and GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT contradict the current
descriptions of the routines.

Edits to 15-007r1
-----------------

[330:1-2 13.6p3] Delete "COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT,", "GET_COMMAND,", and
"GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT,".
