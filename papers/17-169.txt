JP-019 (11.1.7.5, 194:44) comment:
    "inquired about" should be "inquired about or changed".
    Change "inquired about" to "inquired about or changed".

Response:
    The previous sentence reads
        "If it is defined or becomes undefined during any iteration, it
         shall not be referenced, defined, or become undefined during
         any other iteration."
    This covers the "changed" situation, as anything that changes any of
    the list of attributes will also define, or cause to become undefined,
    the variable in question, as does the allocate or deallocate.
    The sentence in question is only about when attribute inquiry is not
    permitted.

    However, this sentence only covers changing the attribute via allocate
    and deallocate, and there are two other ways that a pointer
    association can be affected: nullification and pointer assignment.
    Thus, nullification and pointer assignment in one iteration also needs
    to prohibit attribute inquiry in other iterations.

    An edit is provided to do that.

Previous sentence covers "or changed".

[194:42] 11.1.7.5 Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs,
         p3 "If a variable has SHARED locality..."
         Change "If it is allocated or deallocated"
         to     "If it is allocated, deallocated, nullified, or
                 pointer-assigned".
