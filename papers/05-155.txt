Date: 4 Feb 2005
To: J3
From: John Reid
Subject: Interpretation request re IEEE_SCALB and IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING

NUMBER: F03/00xx
TITLE: Clarification of IEEE_SCALB and IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING
KEYWORDS: IEEE_SCALB, IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: 

1. In IEEE_SCALB, case (iii), line 3 [378:1], was "|2^I|" intended? 

2. In IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING, Result Value, line 4 [382:26], was 
"CALL IEEE_SET_HALTING(FLAG)" intended? 

ANSWER:

1. No. It was intended that this definition be consistent with 
TR 15580, which says "The result is the nearest representable number
with the sign of X.", which in this context means nearest to the
exact value of X*2^I. An edit is supplied. 

2. No. The name IEEE_SET_HALTING was changed to IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE
late in the drafting process and this was overlooked. 
An edit is supplied.

EDITS:

Page and line numbers refer to J3/04-007.

[378:1] Subclause 14.10.16, Result Value, Case (iii), line 3. 
Replace "2^I" by "X*2^I", typeset as elsewhere in this subclause. 
  
[382:26] Subclause 14.10.27, Result Value, line 4. Replace 
"IEEE_SET_HALTING" by "IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE".
