1. Introduction
---------------

Interp F08/0079 observes that the requirements on declarations for
NAMELIST group objects haven't kept up with developments newer than
Fortran 77.

Since it's essentially impossible to produce a one-pass compiler for
Fortran 2008, there's no substantial reason to require that the type and
type parameters of a namelist group object be declared by prior
specifications in the same scoping unit.

3. Edits for consideration for the next revision
------------------------------------------------

[5.6p5 10-007r1:111:5-21]
Remove the first sentence, viz. "A namelist group object ... for the
scoping unit."
