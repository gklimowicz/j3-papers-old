Subject: Interpretation request concerning finalization

NUMBER: F03/0085
TITLE: Finalizing targets of pointer or allocatable actual arguments
KEYWORDS: Finalization, pointer actual argument, allocatable actual
          argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS:

QUESTION:

Consider the program

program Finalize
  type :: T
    ...
  contains
    final :: ...
  end type T

  type(t), pointer :: TV
  allocate ( TV )
  call sub ( TV )
contains
  sub ( A )
    type(t), intent(out) :: A
  end sub A
end program Finalize

The sixth paragraph of 4.5.5.2 [04-007:59:31-32] says "When a procedure is
invoked, a nonpointer nonallocatable object that is an actual argument
associated with an an INTENT(OUT) dummy argument is finalized.''

Is the target of TV finalized with SUB is invoked?

If TV were allocatable instead of a pointer would it be finalized?

ANSWER:

It was intended that an allocatable actual argument or the target of a
pointer actual argument that is associated with an INTENT(OUT) dummy
argument is finalized with the procedure is invoked.  Edits are provided
to correct the error.

EDITS:

Replace the sixth paragraph of 4.5.5.2 [04-007:59:31-32] with the
following:

"When a procedure is invoked, an object that becomes argument associated
with a nonpointer nonallocatable INTENT(OUT) dummy argument of that
procedure is finalized."

Or

"An object that becomes argument associated with a nonpointer
nonallocatable INTENT(OUT) dummy argument of a procedure is finalized when
the procedure is invoked."

Or

"An object is finalized when it becomes argument associated with a
nonpointer nonallocatable INTENT(OUT) dummy argument"
