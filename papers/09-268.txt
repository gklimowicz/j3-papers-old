Discussion

The first of the following edits is based on a suggestion of Malcolm
Cohen in J3/09-239. We think it makes the meaning clearer. We have
replaced Malcolm's "later" with "next" to avoid any suggestion of
time. Note that this refers to the previous sentence:
"During the execution of the program, the value of a lock variable
changes through a sequence of locked and unlocked states due to
the execution of LOCK and UNLOCK statements."

The second edit was suggested by Malcolm Cohen in J3/09-239.

The third edit specifies what happens to the ACQUIRED_LOCK variable
in the event of an error.


Edits to 09-007r2

[193:20-23] In 8.5.6 LOCK and UNLOCK statements, para. 5, replace the
second sentence "If image M ..." by
   "If a lock variable becomes unlocked by execution of an UNLOCK
    statement on image M and next becomes locked by execution of a LOCK
    statement on image T, the segments preceding the UNLOCK statement on
    image M precede the segments following the LOCK statement on image T."

[193:24] In 8.5.6 LOCK and UNLOCK statements, para. 5, final sentence,
delete "with an ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifier".

[193:29] In 8.5.6 LOCK and UNLOCK statements, para. 6, at the end of the
final sentence, add
    "and the value of the ACQUIRED_LOCK variable, if any, is not changed".
