Subject: Issue 61, BITS_KIND result
Reference: J3/06-007r1, J3/06-223


Discussion of issue 61 (page 360)

The editor observes that the Result Value text for the BITS_KIND
intrinsic indirectly imposes new storage size constraints on existing
types.

Edit to 06-007r1:

[359:35-37] Delete the 4th and 5th sentences of the BITS_KIND result
value text, "If X is of type complex with the same kind ... has the
value BIT_SIZE (X)."

[359:37-38] In the last sentence of the BITS_KIND result value text
replace "If X is of a non-default logical or non-default non-integer
numeric type" with "Otherwise".
