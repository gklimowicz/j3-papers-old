[16:33 3.100.1] The editor suggests a subclause about argument
correspondence is a better cross reference than a syntax rule.  Replace
"(R1524)" with "(15.5.2.1") \ref{D15:Argument correspondence}.

[16:36 3.100.2] The editor suggests a subclause about structure
constructors is a better cross reference than a syntax rule.  Replace
"(R757)" with "(7.5.10") \ref{D7:Construction of derived-type values}.

[140:15-18 9.7.1.1p6 141:9-15] The editor suggests the description of an
error condition that arises because a nondeferred type parameter of an
allocate object differs from the corresponding value of <source-expr>
ought more properly be described under 9.7.1.2 "Execution of an ALLOCATE
statement".  Perhaps all of 9.7.1.1p6 ought to be in 9.7.1.2p8.
Editor's choice whether to do anything.

[164:15-16 10.1.11p2(5)] After deleting a list item very similar to (5)
the editor observed that item (6) could also be deleted.  They both
refer to an object accessible by host association within a BLOCK
construct.  Delete 10.1.11p2(5).
