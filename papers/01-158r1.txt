Subject: Interpretation 24 (Termination of a partial record by a
         CLOSE, BACKSPACE, ENDFILE, or REWIND statement)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: 000024
TITLE: Termination of a partial record by a CLOSE, BACKSPACE,
       ENDFILE, or REWIND statement
KEYWORDS:
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Suppose a partial record has been written as a result of a
nonadvancing WRITE.
If the file is closed, or a BACKSPACE, ENDFILE, or REWIND statement
is performed on the file, must the partial record be terminated?

ANSWER:
After a nonadvancing WRITE there is always a current record in a file.
Existing descriptions of file closure and of the BACKSPACE, ENDFILE and
REWIND statements define subsequent operations on the file. Further
clarification in the BACKSPACE, ENDFILE and REWIND cases is provided in
C.6.1.5 [321:7-11].

An edit is provided to make the intention clear.

EDIT:

Page 136. At the end of the last paragraph of subclause 9.2.1.3.1
[136:33] add
   If a nonadvancing output statement leaves a file positioned within
   the current record and no further output statement is executed
   for the file before it is closed or a BACKSPACE, ENDFILE, or REWIND
   statement is executed for it, the effect is as if the output
   statement were the corresponding advancing output statement.
