1. Introduction
===============

After reviewing this failed interpretation, I came to the conclusion
that I agree that we did not make a conscious decision to require
VALUE arguments to have specified intent (i.e. INTENT(IN)) for pure
procedures.  However, I also think that status quo of requiring VALUE
dummy arguments to have INTENT(IN) for pure procedures does not remove
any significant functionality.

Furthermore, the edits that would be required to lift the restriction
are not quite trivial.  Therefore I conclude that we should probably
answer this interpretation in the negative, i.e. with no edits.

It would be a good idea to reconsider this for F2008, perhaps as a
Public Comment.  The only bad thing about this restriction that I can
see is that it doesn't make any sense (it does not help anyone) so
removing it from the standard makes the language design more
consistent.

I append a second attempt at getting the edits for lifting this
restriction, as an interp to F2003, in case the committee think that
we should pursue that route.


2. Revised Interpretation
=========================

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F03/0082
TITLE: VALUE in place of INTENT for pure procedure dummy arguments
KEYWORDS: VALUE, INTENT, PURE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

C1266 requires all nonpointer dummy arguments of a pure function to be
data objects that have INTENT(IN).  C1267 requires all dummy arguments
of a pure subroutine to have specified intents.

Was it intended that VALUE not be allowed in place of INTENT(IN), that
is, was it intended that if a dummy argument of a pure procedure has
the VALUE attribute, it is nonetheless also required to have the
INTENT(IN) attribute explicitly specified?

ANSWER:

The possible extension of the VALUE attribute to allow omission of the
INTENT(IN) attribute in the specific case of pure procedures was not
considered during the development of Fortran 2003.  However, the
standard is consistent and not in error, and so this restriction
should remain.

EDITS:

None.

3. Alternative ANSWER and EDITS
===============================

ANSWER:

It was an oversight that VALUE is not allowed to stand on its own.
Edits are provided to allow its omission, and consequently the
assignment to VALUE dummy arguments of a pure procedure that do not
have INTENT(IN).

EDITS:

[286:12] Change "INTENT(IN)"
         To "have the INTENT(IN) or VALUE attribute".
{Allow VALUE on its own in a pure function subprogram.}

[286:14] After "dummy data objects"
         Append "that do not have the VALUE attribute".
{Allow VALUE on its own in a pure subroutine subprogram.}

[286:24] After "is a dummy argument of a pure function"
         Insert "that does not have the VALUE attribute".
{Allow assignment to VALUE dummies in a pure function; the above
 phrase might look ambiguous but is not because functions cannot have
 the VALUE attribute.}
