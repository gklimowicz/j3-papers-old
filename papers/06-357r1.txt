347:4 Did the co-array team think about a CO_FINDLOC?

This is feature creep and requires a straw vote.  If yes, we will
prepare a paper for the next meeting.

--
362:1 What is the result if team is NULL_IMAGE_TEAM?
It isn't useful or possible to have a null team for the collective
routines.

Edit:  362:9+  For the TEAM argument description, after "(13.8.3.7)"
add "and it must not have the value NULL_IMAGE_TEAM from the ISO_
FORTRAN_INTRINSIC_ENV intrinsic module (13.8.3)".
     Make a similar change for all of the collective routines which
     have a TEAM argument through CO_SUM on 366:16+

--

362:1  Does the issuing image have to be in the team? If I'm
in the earth team, can I collect stuff from the air or
water team if I am not in those teams? If so, who syncs with whom?
Answer, the issuing image must be a member of the team.
Edit.  362:10.  Add as a last sentence to the TEAM description 
"THIS_IMAGE() must be a member of the team."
     Make a similar change for all of the collective routines which
     have a TEAM argument through CO_SUM on 366:16+

As a result of a discussion with John Ried about the
co-array argument to the collective routines, John proposes"

[133:10] In 7.1 Expressions, add to the last line: "An expression is 
not a co-array unless it takes the form of a <designator> for a co-array." 

--
367:3 This appears to allow "n" as a value for DIM, but the result
and case(ii) example use "n-1". Which should it be. In
a way, "n" is OK, since the actual array size is known
to the processor (I think).

Edit:  367:3+  Replace "DIM <= n" with "DIM <= n-1"


--
380:7 The teams are only equal if there is an even number of images.
EDIT: delete "equal "

--
430:7+ I believe co_array must be allocated, etc.
EDIT: after "of any type." add " If it is allocatable it shall 
be allocated."

------------------------------------------------
Comments which require no action or edits.

362:1 Can the RESULT variable of a collective routine also be a 
CO_ARRAY? I think so, but it sounds odd to me.

RESPONSE:  Yes, as viewed on the local image a co-array is just an
 ordinary array. 

364:19 I don't believe that CO_MINLOC and CO_MAXLOC cover the case of
a zero length character string.

RESPONSE:  It's described in the last sentence of the RESULT clause
using essentially the same words as in MINLOC and MAXLOC.

376:16 Is there anything special (force a sync, prohibit,...)
that needs to be done to EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE if it
executes on different images?

RESPONSE:  No.  Calling EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE will cause execution of 
a program that has its own images.  Any image can call this function. 
The new images thus created are different images from any of the images 
of the calling program. 

377:6 EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE also causes a termination. Does the
new STOP, etc., text cover this case also?

RESPONSE:  We believe so. See paper 06-338.

380:2 The intro text [339:16] says that collective subroutines do an
implicit sync before starting execution. That's before the
team has formed in this case. Should it not be a collective
subroutine? Or should it be special cased about the initial
sync?
