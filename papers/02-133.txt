17:9 "struvtures" -> "structures"
18:5 "not in COMMON" ? A variable in common is local,
     I think.  It shares values with other variables,
     perhaps, because it is in common.
18:9 The first sentence of 2.4.3.1.2 mentions "undefined".
     Why doesn't the first sentence of 2.4.3.1.1 also?
32:37 "type-param-value" -> "scalar-int-expr"
      type-paramp-value may be * or :
34:3 "this set of" -> "these" or "the numeric"
     It just seems to read better to me.
36:Note 4.9 The minus signs look like hyphens to me,
            but maybe this is not worth worrying about.
36:Note 4.10:4 Add a comma after "For example"
43:18-19 " ...that contains neither a reference to a
         specification function nor any object designator
         other than a named constant or a subobject thereof."
51:Note 4.39 What does the second example TRIANGLE have to
    do with accessibility?  Should the text say
    "A derived-type definition may have a component that is
     of a derived type with private components" ???
51:Note 4.39 The paragraphs in the notes don't have vertical
    space like the ones in the normative text.
68:15 "POINTER" -> "ALLOCATABLE or POINTER"  ???
71:7 Delete extra space in "A   TYPE"
111:10-11 Move first paragraph of 7.1.1 to last paragraph
          of 7.1 (it has nothing to do with form).
152:4 "a named" -> "named"
152:4 delete "or variable" or
      "or variable" -> "(which may be a variable)"
      The harm with the current words is that they imply
      (suggest?) that a variable is not an expression.
      This sort of thing was carefuly expunged in the past.
195:27-28 "This reference shall be to neither a disassociated
           procedure pointer nor a dummy proceudre or dummy
           procedure pointer that is not present."
252:14 Italicize "binding-name"

What happened to the change bars?
