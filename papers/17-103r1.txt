Discussion:
-----------

In 17-007, 11.6.11 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control
statements, paragraph 9 [218:7-9] says what happens if a STAT= appears
and an error occurs that is different from the cases specified in
paragraphs 7 and 8. The corresponding text in Fortran 2008 [195:11-20]
is in a single paragraph, which made it clear what "the specified
variable" is.  The rewrite in 17-007 [217:30-218:6] no longer gives
context to "the specified variable". The sentence in paragraph 9
needs to be reworded to match the style of paragraphs 7 and 8.

Edit to 17-007:
---------------

[218:7] In 11.6.11 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control
statements, paragraph 9, change

"If any other error condition occurs during execution of a LOCK or
UNLOCK statement, the specified variable becomes defined with"

to

"If the STAT= specifier appears in a <sync-stat> in a LOCK or UNLOCK
statement and any other error condition occurs during execution of
that statement, the <stat-variable> becomes defined with"
