Unresolved Technical Issue (UTI) 81 asks if <source-expr> should be required to
be allocated if it is an allocatable variable. I propose that the answer be YES,
even if there are no deferred-shape parameters. This simplifies the description
and possibly some implementations (not requiring an extra check for allocation
for polymorphic allocatables). A straw-vote may be preferred.

The UTI also proposes that <source-expr> be allowed to determine the shape of
the allocation for arrays. This is not restricted to MOLD and in fact makes more
sense for SOURCE, since in this case conformance of shapes is required. Since
this is not connected to the core functionality of MOLD and does not appear to
be an integration issue, but rather an enhancement, and since it does not provide
any new functionality (other than saving keystrokes), I propose that we do not do
this in this revision.

Edits:

[126:27-] Add new paragraph before the one starting with "If SOURCE= appears":

If <source-expr> appears and is an allocatable variable, it shall be allocated.
