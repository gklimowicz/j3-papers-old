Date: 2020-February-26

Reference: 18-007r1


Introduction:

The HPC subcommittee noticed there are additional events that cause
variables to become undefined that are not included in subclause
19.6.6 Events that cause variables to become undefined. Edits are
provided to repair these oversights.

Edits to 18-007r1.

19.6.6 Events that cause variables to become undefined

[516:7+] add two new list items

 " (28+)If the RESULT_IMAGE argument is present in an invocation of
        any of the collective subroutines CO_MIN, CO_MAX, CO_SUM, or
        CO_REDUCE and the executing image is not the image specified
        by RESULT_IMAGE, the A argument on that image becomes
        undefined.

 (28++) If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of an
        atomic subroutine and an error condition occurs, any other
        argument that is not INTENT(IN) becomes undefined."
