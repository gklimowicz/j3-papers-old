The editor suggests an appropriate fix in his note.

Edits:

119:42-45	Change <proc-binding> to <proc-binding-stmt> (3 times).
120:3-5		Replace note text with the following:

	<proc-binding-stmt> is currently the right BNF nonterminal,
	but this part of the BNF may be in flux because of the
	addition of generic type-bound procedures and the elimination
	of the select-kind-construct, so check that this is still the
	right nonterminal after the dust settles.
