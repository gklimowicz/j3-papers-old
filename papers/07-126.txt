Discussion

In 07-007, only the co-bounds in an allocation for an allocatable co-array 
are required to be the same on all images. This is an error; the bounds, 
too, should be required to be the same on all images. 

Edit to J3/07-007

[128:3-4] About half-way through 6.3.1 ALLOCATE statement, in the paragraph 
that starts "The value of each", change "<allocate-co-array-spec>" to
"<allocation> for a co-array"
