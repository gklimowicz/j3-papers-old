JOR has studied 99-182r1, and has addressed those issues mentioned below.
Note that Interop still has to deal with the second part of the section
labeled "7.5.1.5-6" at the bottom of page 1.  One issue from N1335 is addressed.

Paragraphs not mentioned below are not being addressed by JOR.

Paragraph labeled "5.1.2.13", VOLATILE/EQUIVALENCE interaction:
JOR decided the user needs to specify VOLATILE on equivalenced or otherwise
associated objects, if that functionality is needed.  The processor does not
implicitly apply VOLATILE to any objects associated with an object that has
the VOLATILE attribute.

Edit:
    In section 5.1.2.13, add list item (3) to the existing list.

	(3) Any storage units in the storage sequence of the object are in the
	    storage sequence of a different object that has the VOLATILE
	    attribute.

Commentary:
    the paragraph labeled "7.5.1.5-6".
    With respect to derived type objects in input statement lists,
    neither defined nor intrinsic assignment apply.  Rather, either
    there is a user-defined derived type I/O routine, where the actual
    stuff happens in other statements, or so-called intrinsic I/O happens.
    For this case, we are either doing formatted or unformatted I/O.
    Formatted I/O on derived types (in the absence of user defined d.t.i.o.)
    follows the rules of 9.5.2 [201:22-25], element by element.

    Unformatted I/O follows the rules 9.5.4.4.1, and the bits are just moved.
    This is equivalent to intrinsic assignment,
    since there are not components with the allocatable/pointer attribute.

    Note that derived types with allocatable/pointer components cannot be
    input/output except by a user defined d.t.i.o. routine.

Commentary:
    The paragraph labeled 183:20-21, allowing reOPEN of a file, changing
    access from stream to sequential/vica versa.
    JOR considered this enhancement, and thought it violated too many
    existing restrictions on reOPENs (position, access), and decided not
    to add this functionality.

Edits:
    The paragraph labeled 184:31 was agreed to by JOR.
    In section 9.2.2.3, in list item (3), [184:31], change
        "it is permissible"
    to
	"it may be permissible"

    and change the last word of list item (3) ("created") to
        "created, assuming a READ statement for this connection is permitted."

Commentary:
    Paragraph labeled "199:28".  Base object is listed in the index, and
    is defined at the top of page 103 (line 5), the leftmost part name
    of a part-ref.

Edits:
    Section 9.2.2.3, first sentence, [184:21],
    after "file storage units" add  " (9.2.4)"

Edit suggested by N1335 (INQUIRE by IOLENGTH):
    Section 9.8.3, [222:14], change ".." to "."

    Section 9.8.3, add this paragraph after the last paragraph [222:16+]:
	"The output list in an INQUIRE statement shall not contain any
	 derived type list items that require a user-defined derived type
	 input/output procedure as described in section 9.5.2.  If a derived
	 type list item appears in the output list, the value returned for
         the IOLENGTH specifier assumes that no user-defined derived type
         input/output procedure will be invoked."

    Section 9.5.1.7, 2nd paragraph, change "ASYNCRONOUS" to "ASYNCHRONOUS".
