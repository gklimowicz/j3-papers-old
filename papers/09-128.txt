Subject: Spurious defined terms in clause 10.
Date: 2009 February 03

1. Introduction
---------------

The system for "defining" terms we used in previous versions of the
standard is not in accordance with the ISO guidelines, so we need to stop
using it.  We have already introduced the ISO-compliant defined terms
subclause, and moved/copied many definitions into it.  However, quite a lot
have not been revised.  These should either
  - be turned into normal text ("untermified")
or
  - become proper defined terms.

This paper deals with the terms in clause 10.


2. Terms and what to do with them
---------------------------------

 - repeat specification: BNF Analogue, Only Used In Clause 10;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - edit descriptor: Widely Used, BNF Analogue;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - data edit descriptor: BNF Analogue, Not A Definition;
   = reword, untermify, index as definition.

 - control edit descriptor: Ditto;
   = ditto.

 - character string edit descriptor: Ditto;
   = ditto.

 - scale factor: BNF Analogue;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - field: Special Term, Only in Clause 10;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - field width: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - format control: Nearly All In Clause 10;
   = untermify, index as definition.
   Maybe 10.4 should be called "Format control interpretation"?

 - left tab limit: Special Term, Used in Clauses 9 and 10;
   = untermify, index as definition; there are already cross-refs
   on the uses in c09 so no problem.

 - value separator: Special Term, Obvious, Mostly in Clause 10;
   = untermify, index as definition; there is already a
   cross-ref on the only other use (in clause 9).

 - name-value subsequences: Plural, Obvious, Limited Use;
   = untermify, index singular as definition.


3. Edits to 09-007
------------------

[248:12(10.3.1 C1002)] "repeat specifier"->"repeat specification".
{Correct mistake.  Note to the editor: occurs twice in the LaTeX sourc,
 and both need to be changed.}

[248:18(10.3.1p1)] Unembolden "repeat specification", index as defn.

[248:20-21(10.3.2p1)] Replace whole paragraph with
  "An \mindexd*{edit descriptor} is a \mindexd*{data edit descriptor}
   (\si{data-edit-desc}), \mindexd*{control edit descriptor}
   (\si{control-edit-desc}), or \mindexd*{character string edit
   descriptor (\si{char-string-edit-desc})."
{I.e. unembolden everything but index them as definitions, factor out the
 unnecessary indefinite articles, insert the BNF terms so we actually have
 definitions.}

[249:35(10.3.2p3)] Unembolden "scale factor", index as definition.

[250:26(10.3.3p1)] Unembolden "field", index as definition.

[250:27(10.3.3p1)] Unembolden "field width", do not index.

[250:29(10.4p1)] Unembolden "format control", index as definition.

[262:2(10.8.1.1p1)] Unembolden "left tab limit", index as definition.

[264:33(10.10.2p3)] Unembolden "value separator", index as definition.

[268:19(10.11.2p1)] Unembolden "name-value subsequences",
                    index "name-value subsequence" as definition.

[268:25(10.11.2p3)] Change ref 10.10 to 10.10.2.
{10.10.2 is "Values and value separators", so obviously a better cross-
 ref than "List-directed formatting".}
