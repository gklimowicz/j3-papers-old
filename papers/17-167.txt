GB-027 comment:

    "The list is not complete because an explicit interface is
     required for a procedure that is an actual argument in a
     reference to a procedure and corresponds to a dummy argument that
     is a pure procedure."


Response:

    We agree that the existing list is inadequate.  An edit is
    provided to include cases where a procedure is used, rather than
    only referenced, in a context requiring it to be pure.

Edit:

[303:21-23] 15.4.2.2 Explicit Interface

      Replace item (1) by
      "(1) a reference to the procedure appears with an argument
           keyword (15.5.2),
       (1a) the procedure is used in a context that
            requires it to be pure (15.7)"
