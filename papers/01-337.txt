1. Introduction

Following the work in paper 01-327, this paper changes the words
"is present" into "appears" in Chapters 13 to 16, the Annex A "Glossary"
Annex B "Decremental features" and Annex C "Extended notes" of the
Draft Standard 01-007r2.

2. Edits.

None necessary.

[Annex B contains a few instances of the phrase "present in Fortran 66, ..."
 because this is informative text, and the replacement would sound
 awkward, it is left unchanged]
