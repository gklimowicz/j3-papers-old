[419:22]  The description for the SOURCE argument to RESHAPE says it
must have "constant size".  Does this mean the size is limited to
constants, or to initialization expressions, or is it a restriction on
variables used in the dimension to not change?

Could I do something like
       deallocate (shape)
       read *, N
       allocate (shape(N))
is it OK if I consistently enter the same number for N every time?

Assuming we don’t need an interp about this,

Proposed edit:
[419:22]
Change "constant size" to "constant size given by an initialization
expression"
