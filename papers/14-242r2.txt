NUMBER: F08/0119
TITLE: Branching to END BLOCK and END CRITICAL
KEYWORD: Branching, END BLOCK, END CRITICAL
DEFECT TYPE: Error
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Do the GO TO statements in the following conform to the Fortran 2008
standard?

  go to 1
  block
1 end block

  go to 2
  critical
2 end critical

ANSWER:

Branching to an END BLOCK or END CRITICAL statement from outside the
construct was intended to be prohibited.  Edits are provided to
correct this omission.

EDITS:

[172:13+] 8.1.4 BLOCK construct, after p3 (before NOTE 8.5),
          Insert new paragraph
            "It is permissible to branch to an <end-block-stmt> only
             from within its BLOCK construct.".

[173:21+] 8.1.5 CRITICAL construct, after p3 (before NOTE 8.6),
          Insert new paragraph
            "It is permissible to branch to an <end-critical-stmt>
             only from within its CRITICAL construct.".

FUTURE REVISION:

A future revision could make all of these constraints, and combine
them into a single requirement as follows.

[170:36 8.1.3.2p3] Delete the paragraph.

[175:35-36 8.1.6.4p1] Delete "It is permitted ... DO construct."

[175:40 8.1.6.4p2] Delete "Transfer of control ... <inner-shared-do-
construct>."

[180:25 8.1.7.2p2] Delete "It is permissible ... IF construct."

[182:26 8.1.8.2p3] Delete the paragraph.

[185:26 8.1.9.2p9] Delete the paragraph.

[187:7+ 8.2.1p1+] Insert constraints:

"C847a If a branch target statement is an <end-associate-stmt>,
       <end-block-stmt>, <end-critical-stmt>, <end-do>,
       <end-if-stmt>, <end-select-stmt>, or <end-select-type-stmt>, the
       branching statement that references the label of that branch
       target statement shall be within the construct completed by that
       branch target statement."

"C847b If a branch target statement is a <do-term-shared-stmt>,
       the branching statement shall be within the range of the
       corresponding <inner-shared-do-construct>."
