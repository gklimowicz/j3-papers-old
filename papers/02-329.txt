I am writing to request that the proposed use of square brackets "[.]" in
the Fortran 2000 standard be reconsidered.  It is difficult for me to
believe that the proposed use of square brackets has higher priority than
keeping them available to support interval data types.

Hello.  I echo Bill Walster's request that square brackets be used to
represent intervals in standard Fortran.  It's hard to think of a more
standard meaning of [a,b] than to mean "the interval between a and b".

I would like to support this request from Bill Walster.  As an active
researcher and practitioner in numerical and computational techniques for
solving Chemical Engineering problems, where interval techniques have a
strong role to play and Fortran is still a key standard, the use of square
brackets for this purpose is of key importance to us.
