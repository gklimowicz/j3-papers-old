Discussion

The editor remarks that there can be no operations defined by
intrinsic functions. While this is true for Fortran operations,
it is not so for the operations of the IEEE standard. Section 5
of the IEEE standard states
   "All conforming implementations of this standard shall provide
   operations to add, subtract, multiply, divide, extract the square
   root, find the remainder, round to integer in floating-point format,
   convert between different floating-point formats, convert between
   floating-point and integer formats, convert binary <-> decimal, and
   compare."
Edits are provided to make this clear.

The editor also says that it would help to know exactly which
specifications are involved. We agree and propose the addition of a
note.


Edits to 07-007r3

[437:4-6,8-10,12-14] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, replace the second
sentence of paragraph 4 by
   "Where these are supported, their behavior for the unary and
   binary operations of Section 5 of the IEEE International Standard
   including those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions
   in intrinsic modules, shall be consistent with the specifications
   in the IEEE International Standard".
Make the same change in paragraphs 5 and 6.

[437:14+] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, after paragraph 6, add
   "NOTE 14.7a
   The operations of Section 5 of the IEEE International Standard
   are add, subtract, multiply, divide, extract the square
   root, find the remainder, round to integer in floating-point format,
   convert between different floating-point formats, convert between
   floating-point and integer formats, convert binary <-> decimal, and
   compare."
