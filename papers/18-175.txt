Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, the GB comment
042 reads:

"The restriction defined in subclause 18.3.7 para 2 item (6) does not
appear in the constraints on interoperable procedure interfaces in
subclause 15.6.2.1."

with the suggested edit:

After constraint C1556 add a new constraint:

"C1556a If <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for a procedure,
each dummy argument of type CHARACTER with the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER
attributes shall have deferred character length."

Discussion
----------

Agree with the omission, but prefer to have the new constraint follow
C1554 which deals with arguments with the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER
attribute, and covers the assumed length case for CHARACTER.


Edit to N2146
-------------

[328:p6] In 15.6.2.1 Procedures defined by subprograms - General, in
paragraph 6 dealing with procedures with a
<proc-language-binding-spec>, insert a new constraint after the 3rd
constraint, C1554, which ends "of type CHARACTER with assumed length,
or that has the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute.":

"C1554a If <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for a procedure,
each dummy argument of type CHARACTER with the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER
attributes shall have deferred character length."
