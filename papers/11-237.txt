Subject: Renumber clauses in TS 29113
From: Bill Long

References: WG5/N1869

Discussion:

To better conform with the ISO/IEC Directives Part 2, subclauses 1.1,
1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 should be renumbered as main clauses 1, 2, 3, and 4.


Edits to N1869:

Remove "1 Overview".

Change subclause 1.1 to clause 1.

Change subclause 1.2 to clause 2.

Change subclause 1.3 to clause 3.

At the beginning of the new clause 3, insert a heading "3.1 General",
and elevate 1.3.1 ... 1.3.3 to 3.2 ... 3.4.  Note 1.1 becomes Note 3.1

Change subclause 1.4 to clause 4, and elevate 1.4.1 ... 1.4.2 to 4.1
... 4.2.

Renumber subsequent clauses, and correct any incorrect references.
