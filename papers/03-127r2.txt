Subject: Edits for UK comment E22  (Indexing asterisk)
Date: 2 Apr 2003

This revision adds several more places that were pointed out to me.

Comment E22 of the UK vote was:

E22 Annex E
    Page 533
    Asterisk is used for so many different purposes in addition to
    multiplication, it is confusing to select only one of them for the
    index.  The entry should be removed or should be made comprehensive.


Index tags for asterisk should be added to:

29:22  (comment indicator for fixed form)
32:17  (assumed type parameter)
33:24  (multiplication operator)
72:13  (char length selector alternative syntax)
73:32  (unlimitted polymorphic object)
78:1   (assumed size array dimension)
86:19  (repeat indicator for data initialization)
195:6  (default i/o unit)
195:15 (list-directed i/o indicator)
224:34 (in output field)
235:18 (repeat indicator for list directed data)
239:25 (repeat indicator for namelist data)
263:18 (prefix for alternate return label)
278:1  (alternate return)
