    "** /J3 **"  marks a J3 section of the meeting.

3.  The WG5 draft minutes were expertly prepared by David Muxworthy
    and can be found in N1977.  Various WG5 discussions were so
    diplomatically summarized therein that these minutes quote N1977
    when the J3 secretary deemed it prudent.

1. Opening of the Meeting
The meeting opened at 09:00 on Monday 24 June 2013.

2. Opening business
2.1 Introductory remarks from the Convenor
The convenor said that the principal objectives of the meeting were:
firstly to develop the draft TS on further coarray facilities;
secondly to consider the defect reports in document 13-006A; thirdly
to construct an initial list of deficiencies and discrepancies in
Fortran 2008 to be addressed in the next revision.

2.2 Welcome from the Host
Toon Moene, on behalf of NEN, welcomed participants to Delft.

2.3 Local arrangements
The host described local arrangements and said that there would be a
dinner for participants on the Wednesday evening.

2.4 Appointments for this meeting
The drafting committee would be Reinhold Bader, Daniel Chen, Toon
Moene, David Muxworthy (chair), Van Snyder and Masayuki Takata.  David
Muxworthy would act as secretary and John Reid as librarian.

2.5 Adoption of the agenda (N1964)
The preliminary agenda was adopted, with the addition of three
tutorials (see below).

2.6 Approval of the minutes of the Markham 2012 Meeting (N1926)
The minutes of the 2012 meeting were approved.  It was agreed that in
future minutes would be circulated for approval by WG5 letter ballot
approximately one month after each meeting.

3. Matters arising from the minutes
The convenor reported that it was no longer proposed that the CD stage
be omitted from standards development; in future the CD stage would be
optional, as determined by the Working Group.

4. Status of Markham 2012 Resolutions (N1927)
There was nothing to report.

5. Reports
5.1 SC22 Matters (Convener)
A report of the 2012 SC22 meeting was in document N1940.  The meeting
had, as an experiment, allowed remote participation.  There was then a
short discussion as to whether remote participation would be suitable
for WG5 meetings.  Opinion generally was not in favour.  It was
reported that the three-year, or three-edition, limit on corrigenda
(v. ISO/IEC Directives Part1, 2.10.4) would not to be enforced.

5.2 National Activity Reports (Heads of Delegations)
Canada:   The Canadian programming language committee had
          representatives for Ada, C, C++, Cobol and Fortran.  It met
          at IBM.
Germany:  A set of requirements for the next revision was being
          developed but was not yet complete.  Tobias Burnus had
          implemented a large part of the interoperability TS for
          gfortran.
Japan:    Translation of Fortran 2008 was proceeding slowly due to lack
          of resources.  It would take at least another two years.
Netherlands: The Dutch programming language committee, NC381022, had
          representatives for C, C++, Cobol and Fortran and met twice
          a year.
UK:       Report is in N1976.
US:       Report is in N1974.

5.3 Report from Primary Development Body (NCITS/J3 Chair)
Report is in N1974.

5.4 Reports from other Development Bodies (Editors/Heads)
TS on further coarray facilities: Bill Long
This was dealt with under item 6 below.

5.5 Liaison Reports:
NCITS/PL22.11 (C): Dan Nagle
     There was nothing of note to report.
MPI: Bill Long
     Developments in the MPI 3 Fortran interface looked encouraging
     although there was a lack of knowledge of Fortran.
UPC: Bill Long (for Damian Rouson)
     UPC 1.3 draft consisted of the language, a required library and
     an optional library. Some UPC customers were unhappy with the state
     of UPC. Some had come to Cray asking for new features.   There was
     now a Cray C++ coarray compiler with the Fortran semantics and
     analogous syntax reproduced in C++ using a class library.  No
     change to the actual C++ compiler was involved.
IFIP/WG2.5: Van Snyder
     No news was available.
OpenMP: Bill Long
     The OpenMP Board were incorporating the capabilities of OpenACC and
     had almost completed the work.
WG23 (Vulnerabilities): Dan Nagle
     The current draft of the third edition of the Vulnerabilities TS,
     WG23/n0453, included a Fortran annex.  A couple of mistakes had
     been found in the annex.  WG23 were continuing to add new
     vulnerabilities.  WG21 were not interested in contributing an
     annex for C++.

1.4 Subgroup meetings

1.5 Subgroup reports (4:33pm)

** /WG5  **  << begin N1977 - WG5 minutes excerpts >>

The subgroup developing the further coarray TS reported on progress.
The subgroup examining proposals for the revision of Fortran 2008
which were in documents 13-244r1 and N1975 reported on their
preliminary conclusions (described in more detail below).  For ease of
reference proposals from 13-244r1 are written as US-nn and those from
N1975 as UK-nn.

** /J3 **

   /JATA

   In 13-244r1 and N1975, subgroup recommends items US-1, 3, 4, 5, 8,
   12, 14 and UK-2, 3, 5, 6 , 8. Subgroup suggests a block vote on
   these. UK-9 is subsumed by US-14. On UK-10, subgroup recommends all
   except subitem 2C.  It likes both US-13 and UK-1 but thinks they are
   too large. WG5 should decide which (if either) it prefers.

   Subgroup recommends deferral of remaining items: US-2, 6, 7, 9, 10,
   11, 15, 16, 17 and UK-4, 7 and UK 10-2C.

** /WG5  **  << begin N1977 - WG5 minutes excerpts >>

There was a discussion on the CHANGE TEAM construct in N1967. A proposal
that the rules be changed so that CHANGE TEAM involves the separate
synchronization of each of the teams it creates was approved 12-0-0.
A straw vote on a proposal that images of the parent team could access
subteams was 5-2-5.

Kees Ampt, a member of various programming language committees since

** /WG5 ** << begin N1977 - WG5 minutes excerpts >>

There was a discussion on changing the requirements for further
coarray features.  A vote on whether to add syntax to specify a
codimension relative to another team was 6-0-6. A vote on whether to
allow general access of coarrays across subteams was 6-2-4.  A vote
on whether FORM SUBTEAM should allow choice of image number was
5-0-6.  A proposal that objects should include minimal portable
handling of failed images was approved by 9-1-2.  The revisions to
the requirements are in 13-292r1.

   13-256 "Editorial stuff concerning CRITICAL and CONCURRENT
   constructs" [Snyder] and 13-257 "Trivial technical change

   There will be no further action on 13-261 "Amendments to TS 29113"
   [Bader] - item D was in 13-283

   /J3

   The list of papers for voting, discussion, or action later in
   the week was discussed.

** /WG5 ** << begin N1977 - WG5 minutes excerpts >>

There was a discussion on revision of N1925, the WG5 Strategic Plan
(agenda item 10).  The plan from 2012 had assumed that technical work
on the TS on further coarray facilities would be essentially complete
when revision of the full language was still in its preliminary
stages, enabling it to be incorporated into the revision.  This now
seemed unlikely.  Thus the question was whether, and by how much, the
schedule for the latter should be delayed, or whether the two
schedules should be uncoupled.  Discussion was adjourned to the
following day.

   atomics a nightmare?" [Maclaren]

** /WG5 ** << begin N1977 - WG5 minutes excerpts >>

There was a discussion on the revision of requirements for the further
coarray TS (N1930).  It was proposed to delete the requirement that
when a block of code is executed on images executing as a team, it
should execute on those images as if the program contained no other
images.  A country vote was: delete the requirement 3 (CA, NL, US);
retain it 0; abstain 3 (DE, JP, GB).

There was a discussion on future meetings (agenda item 11.1).  It was
decided not to change the existing proposals for 2014 and 2015.  Dan
Nagle offered to investigate possibilities in the Boulder area for
2016.  This was gratefully accepted.

Two alternative plans for the schedule of the further coarray TS were
considered  (agenda item 10.1).  It was decided that decoupling the
TS schedule from the main language schedule could be avoided if the
former slipped by no more than four months.  The agreed schedule is
in N1979.

There were votes on whether WG5 should apply for a new project to
develop a TS on units of measure, following the presentation on
Wednesday.  The individual vote was: yes 3 - no 7 - abstain 1.  The
country vote was: yes 0 - no 3 (CA, JP, GB) - abstain 3 (DE, NL, US).

** /J3 **

   /WG5

   Paper N1982 "Removal of deficiencies and discrepancies in Fortran"
   [Cohen] list the items that have been identified by WG5 as          deficiencies and discrepancies in Fortran 2008 to be addressed in       Fortran 2015 development:

     UK items (N1975):
      UK-02 (Specifiable default accessibility for USEd module's
             entities)
      UK-03 (RECL= for umlimited records)
      UK-04 subitem 1 only (allow E0.d, ES0.d, EN0.d edit descriptors)
      UK-05 (Improve generic disambiguation rules)
      UK-06 (Remove restriction on ERROR STOP)
      UK-08 (New reduction intrinsic REDUCE)
      UK-09 see US-14.
      UK-10 except subitems 2c and 3
           (Delete arithmetic IF, shared DO termination, and DO
            termination other than on CONTINUE and ENDDO;  Obsolesce
            EQUIVALENCE, COMMON, label on block DO, specific intrinsics,
            FORALL.)

     US items (J3/13-244r1):
      US-01 (Allow g0.d)
      US-03 (Require diagnosability of nonstandard intrinsic modules
             etc)
      US-04 (Control of host association), see J3/13-238.
      US-05 (Improve DIM= argument handling in intrinsics), see interp
             F08/0038)
      US-08 (Specify explicit specification of EXTERNAL attribute is
             required)
      US-12 (Allow SIZE= with advancing input)
      US-14 (Compatibility with ISO/IEC 60559:2010).

     Items UK-01, UK-04 subitems 2 and 3, UK-07, UK-10 subitems 2c and
     3, US-02, US-06, US-07, US-09, US-10, US-11, US-13, US-15, US-16,
     and US-17, will not be addressed in Fortran 2015, subject to WG5
     review in 2014.

   N1979 is the revised WG5 schedule for TS 18508 and F2015, showing
   no delay in the first year, but a possible delay after.

   Paper 13-292r1 "TS requirements changes" [Reid] updates N1930 to
   produce N1981 "Requirements for additional parallel features in
   Fortran" [Reid]

   /HPC

   The coarray TS now contains 3 new defined types, EVENT_TYPE,
   TEAM_TYPE, and LOCK_TYPE, all with the same restrictions.  Rather
   than repeat those restrictions in 3 places, Bill and Malcolm will
   try to define a new term that gives the rules once and then the
   other places refer to it.

           Lionel) as amended, subsumes 13-275: uc {post r3}
