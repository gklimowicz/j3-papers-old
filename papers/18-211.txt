Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, GB comment 058
reads:

"Correction. The definition of "version" is incomplete. It does not
allow for different procedures in a program being processed with
different versions, nor for a structure being defined by Fortran."


with the suggested edit:

Delete the description of version, i.e. "The value is equal
... descriptor was established." and replace it by "If the descriptor
was established in a C function, it is the value of CFI_VERSION in
ISO_Fortran_binding.h when that source file was translated. Otherwise,
it is the version of ISO_Fortran_binding.h with which the descriptor
established by Fortran is compatible.".


Discussion
----------

We believe the possibilities demanded by the comment are enabled by
removing the text on the time of establishment.

Edit to N2146
-------------

[492] 18.5.3 The CFI_cdesc_t structure type, para2,
int_version, remove

" when the descriptor was established"

so the complete sentence will read:

"int version; The value is equal to the value
of CFI_VERSION in the source file ISO_Fortran_binding.h
that defines the format and meaning of this C descriptor."
