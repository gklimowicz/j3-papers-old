Discussion:

UK comment GB48 proposes to delete the text in A.2.1 starting with
"The following example provides..." and through the end of the A.2.1.

Justification: The example of copying a possibly-noncontiguous array
to a contiguous buffer is hard to understand and has poor performance.

However, it is sometimes necessary to make contiguous copies of a
noncontiguous array. For example, a contiguous copy of an actual
argument would be required if the corresponding dummy argument is an
assumed-shape array with the CONTIGUOUS attribute.  Because this is
not trivial, the example is useful.

The current A.2.1 really contains two examples, and would be better
split into two subclauses.


Edits to N1869:

In A.2.1, before the text starting with "The following example
provides..." add a new subclause heading: "A.2.1a Creating a
contiguous copy of an array".

In A.2.1, add a new sentence at the beginning of the paragraph
starting "The following example provides...": "A C function might need
to create a contiguous copy of an array section, such as when the
section is an actual argument corresponding to a dummy argument with
the CONTIGUOUS attribute."
