The IMPORT statement has been extended to cover host association
outside an interface block and C894 is intended to say that it must
not be used like this if there is no host from which host association
can occur. However it says
   "An IMPORT statement shall not appear in the specification-part of a
   main-program, external subprogram, module, or block-data."
which excludes its appearance in an interface block in a module,
for example,
   module mod
     integer i
     interface
       subroutine sub
         import
       end subroutine sub
     end interface
   end module mod

The following edit is needed:

---------------

[123:7] In 8.8 IMPORT statement, C894, change "specification-part"
to "scoping unit".
