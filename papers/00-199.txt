Issue 112: [394: 1-6]

1. Introduction

Issue 112 mentions that note 16.18 in 16.2.6 needs an example. The
example in note 16.17 covers this. Notes 16.17 and 16.18 should be
combined, in order to improve the clarity of the text.

2. Edits

[393:43+] Add to note:

A C pointer may correspond to a Fortran dummy argument of type C_PTR
with the VALUE attribute or to a Fortran scalar that does not have the
VALUE attribute. In the example, the C pointer 'm' corresponds to the
Fortran dummy argument 'M' of type C_PTR, and the C pointers 'j' and
'k' correspond to the Fortran scalars 'J' and 'K', respectively.
