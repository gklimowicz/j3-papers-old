Subject:	standardize printing (a/k/a "carriage control")

Users have long complained of being unable, in a standard conforming manner, to determine or to specify which external connected files suffer from printing as specified in section 9.5.5.  This proposal is to add a PRINTING= specifier to OPEN and INQUIRE statements to give the program a means to determine and specify this processor dependency.

EDITS:

(add PRINTING= to OPEN)

173:22+ Add
or PRINTING = <scalar-default-char-expr>

177:26+ (after the J3 internal note) Add
9.4.4.14
PRINTING= specifier in the OPEN statement

The <scalar-default-char-expr> shall evaluate to YES or NO.  If the <scalar-default-char-expr> evaluates to YES, output records are printed as specified by section 9.5.5.  If the <scalar-default-char-expr> evaluates to NO, output records are not printed as specified by section 9.5.5.  This specifier is permitted only for a file being connected for formatted input/output.  This specifier is ignored during formatted input.  If this specifier is omitted, the default value is processor dependent.

(add PRINTING= to INQUIRE)

200:1+ Add
or PRINTING = <scalar-default-char-variable>

204:43+ Add
PRINTING= specifier in the INQUIRE statement

The <scalar-default-char-variable> is assigned the value YES if the file is connected for formatted input/output and output records are printed as specified by section 9.5.5, the <scalar-default-char-variable> is assigned the value NO if the file is connected for formatted input/output and output records are not printed as specified by section 9.5.5, the <scalar-default-char-variable> is assigned the value UNKNOWN if the file is connected for formatted input/output and the processor cannot determined whether output records are printed as specified by section 9.5.5.

(Clarify list-directed formatting and printing)

228:41 Add
List-directed formating does not imply that the record is printed.

(Clarify namelist formatting and printing)

233:45 Add
Namelist formating does not imply that the record is printed.
