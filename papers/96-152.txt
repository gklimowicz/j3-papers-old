Thanks, Lynn.  Too bad we didn't get this notice last week, as we could have
taken a roll call vote at our X3J3 meeting last week.  As I read the timing,
it would be OK for us to act on this at our November meeting, so we will
schedule a roll call vote then; let me know if this is not satisfactory.
