QUESTION:

7.4.2 C727 says a "<procedure-name> [that is a <proc-target>] shall
be the name of an external ... procedure...."

To be passed as an actual argument, a procedure needs to have the
EXTERNAL attribute, but there appears to be no such requirement for
being a target in a procedure pointer assignment.

(1) Is the following example standard-conforming?

  PROGRAM example1
  PROCEDURE(),POINTER :: p
  PROCEDURE(REAL),POINTER :: q
  p => x
  CALL x
  q => y
  PRINT *,y(5)
  CALL p
  PRINT *,q(5)
  END
  SUBROUTINE x
  PRINT *,'ok so far'
  END
  FUNCTION y(n)
  y = SQRT(REAL(n))
  END

(2) If example1 is standard-conforming, is this example conforming?

  MODULE exmod
    PROCEDURE(),POINTER :: p
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE test
      CALL p
    END SUBROUTINE
  END
  PROGRAM example2
    USE exmod
    p => x
    CALL test
  END
  SUBROUTINE x
    PRINT *,'ok'
  END

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, this example is conforming.  As correctly noted, there is no
    requirement for the EXTERNAL attribute in a procedure pointer
    assignment, and both X and Y are known within the main program
    to be external procedures.

(2) This example was not intended to be conforming.  An edit is
    provided to clarify this.

EDIT:

[144:5-6] In 7.4.2 Pointer assignment, constraint C727,
   Change "an external, module," to "a module",
   Change "or a procedure pointer" to
     "a procedure pointer, or an external procedure that is accessed by
      USE or host association, referenced in the scoping unit as a
      procedure, or that has the EXTERNAL attribute".
