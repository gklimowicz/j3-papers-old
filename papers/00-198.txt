Issue 226: [69:15-22]

1. Analysis

The paragraph preceding the J3 internal note has to be adapted,
because, as it stands, it does not allow data entities with the
BIND(C) attribute, which are declared in different scoping units with
reference to the same name, to be the same.

The J3 internal note mentions the option of either fixing or deleting
the paragraph. Deleting is not really an option, since the paragraph
describes a restriction on the declaration of a derived type.

The following section lists the edits which fix the paragraph.

2. Edits

[69:11-14] Change paragraph to:

A derived-type dummy argument, which is declared with respect to a
derived-type definition, which has neither the SEQUENCE property, nor
a BIND(C) attribute, shall be specified with respect to a derived-type
definition that is accessed by use association or host association
because the same definition needs to be used to declare both the
actual and dummy arguments to ensure that both are of the same derived
type.
