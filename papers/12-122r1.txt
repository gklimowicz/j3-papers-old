1. Introduction

This paper discusses the standing documents and other procedures for the
next revision.  It might seem a bit early for the next revision but we are
accumulating editorial changes and technical fixes quite quickly.

Since I am looking at the standing documents, the web site's links are
also discussed.


2. Corrigenda edit question

It would be useful for the edits from the corrigenda be included in the
008.

ACTION: (i) Editor will include the edits from corrigendum 1 in either
            12-008r1 or 12-008r2.  At that time the title of the document
            will change.
	(ii) Web link title to be changed when the document title changes.

3. Editor's other standing documents

In the list below, the title listed is the one shown on the web site.

011 Edit Issues

  Current version (as of 2012/01/29): 09-011r2.
  Web site linked version (as of 2012/01/29): 09-011.
  Both of these are out of date and uninteresting except possibly
  historically; a new "empty" version has been submitted.
ACTION: Web link title change requested.

  Current version (as of 2012/01/29): 06-014.

  A new version of this is underway (12-018) for 10-007r1.
  It will contain only the edits from corrigendum 1.
ACTION: Editor to produce 12-018 as soon as possible.
