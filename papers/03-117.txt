Subject: Edits for UK comment TC9 (Remove ENUM)
Date: 11 February 2003

Comment TC9 of the UK vote was:

TC9 Remove the ENUM facility.

    ENUM complicates the language and adds little to the Fortran
    language per se; it appears to be of use only in conjunction with
    C.  Moreover this definition inhibits future development of a more
    useful enumeration type.


The following edits remove ENUM.

10:9. Delete line

14:0+  Table 2.1. Delete "enumeration declarations,"

14:0+  Table 2.2 Notes: Delete "enum statements, "

28: 2+.  Delete "END ENUM"

61:14 to 63:1+.  Delete section 4.7 including notes 4.63 and 4.64

381:10.  Delete "enumerations (4.7),"
