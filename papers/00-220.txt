Subject:	eliminate printing (a/k/a "carriage control")

Users have long complained of being unable, in a standard conforming manner, to determine or to specify which external connected files suffer from printing as specified in section 9.5.5.  The processing specified in 9.5.5 is obsolete, and is not commonly done for disk files, printing is a separate process.  This proposal is to delete all mention of printing from the Fortran standard.
