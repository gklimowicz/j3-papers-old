Subject: Image control statements in DO CONCURRENT
Date: 2008 June 23
References: J3/08-007r2 (WG5/N1723)


Discussion:

There appears to be no restriction on the appearance of image control
statements in a DO CONCURRENT construct. The iterations of the loop may
be executed in any order or at the same time. It makes no sense to
subdivide the loop into segments.

Edits to J3/08-007r2 (WG5/N1723):

[179] In 8.1.7.7, Restrictions on DO CONCURRENT constructs, after C826, add

C826a An image control statement shall not appear within a  DO CONCURRENT
      construct.
