Subject: BOZ: Issue 351

These edits attempt to resolve unresolved issue 351, on page 330
of 02-007.

The approach is to describe the value returned by REAL type
conversion intrinsic in terms of the value a variable
with the appropriate type and type parameters would have if its
value was the bit pattern specified by the BOZ constant.

Edits:

[330:3-6] replace these lines with
    "<Case (iii):>  If A is a <boz-literal-constant>, the value
		    of the result is equal to the value that a
		    variable of the same type and kind type parameters
		    as the result would have if its value was the bit
		    pattern specified by the <boz-literal-constant>.
		    The interpretation of the value of the bit pattern
		    is processor dependent."
