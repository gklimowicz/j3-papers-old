1. Introduction

Paper 19-181 is a request for interpretation regarding the execution
of a FORM TEAM statement by a team containing failed images.  Papers
19-240 and 19-241 are responses from the interp subcommittee that
reject the need for interpretation at this time, but ask HPC to
look at 11.6.9 FORM TEAM to ensure that it describes the desired
semantics in the presence of failed images, and welcomes suggestions
for wording improvements for consideration in the next revision.

2. Discussion

Clause 11.6.9 describes the cases that cause the team variable
specified in a FORM TEAM statement to become defined.  Successful
execution of a FORM TEAM statement causes the team variable to
become defined. If <stat-var> becomes defined with the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, the team variables also become defined. Active
images are assigned to teams; inactive images are not. In all
other cases, some other error condition occurs and the team variable
becomes undefined.

HPC does believe the wording of 11.6.9 could be improved. We also
noticed that some cases are missing from clauses 19.6.5 and 19.6.6
(Events that cause variables to become (un)defined) were missing for
variables of type TEAM_TYPE. Edits are provided to these sections.

3. Edits to 18-007r1

11.6.9 FORM TEAM statement
[205:7] Change
  "Successful execution of a FORM TEAM statement"
to
  "Execution of a FORM TEAM statement that is successful, or that
   assigns the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE (11.6.11) to <stat-variable>,"

so that the first sentence reads:
  "Execution of a FORM TEAM statement that is successful, or that
   assigns the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE (11.6.11) to <stat-variable>,
   creates a new team for each unique <team-number> value specified
   by the active images of the current team."

19.6.5 Events that cause variables to become defined
[513:42] Change
  "Successful execution of a FORM TEAM statement"
to
  "Execution of a FORM TEAM statement that is successful, or execu-
   tion of a FORM TEAM statement with a STAT= specifier that
   causes the variable specified by the STAT= specifier to become
   defined with the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, "

resulting in the entire list item to read:

  "(35) Execution of a FORM TEAM statement that is successful, or
       execution of a FORM TEAM statement with a STAT= specifier that
       causes the variable specified by the STAT= specifier to become
       defined with the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, causes the team
       variable to become defined."

19.6.6 Events that cause variables to become undefined
[517:7+] insert a new list item
 "(28+) Execution of a FORM TEAM statement with a STAT= specifier that
        causes the variable specified by the STAT= specifier with a
        value other than zero or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the intrinsic
        module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, causes the team variable to become
        undefined."
