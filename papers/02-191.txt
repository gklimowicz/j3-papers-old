Date:     6 May 2002
To:       J3
From:     Richard Maine
Subject:  Pre-meeting editorial fixes

The following typo/editorial fixes have been made subsequent
to 02-007R1.  These have already been checked into CVS, assuming
J3 concurrance, though they are trivially undoable.  There is
believed to be no technical content to these edits.  They should
not need a J3 vote (unless there is an objection to any of them).

As we near release of the CD, the editor plans to take fewer liberties
in fixing even editorial matters, so that the CD is a product of J3,
rather than a product of J3 as modified by the editor.  Thus I wanted
this available at the meeting so that J3 at least has a chance to
object to any of the edits (not that I anticipate objection).
The draft that comes out of this meeting will be the one that
goes into the joint wg5/j3 summer meeting.

Please note that this implies that J3 needs to adequately vet
edits passed at the May meeting - don't just assume that the editor
will fix up any obvious problems.

Many of the edits below resulted from private emails to me; I
haven't bothered to attribute the source of each one.

EDITS

  Fixed table numbering (was mixed up with note numbering).

  [55:3] Added missing space after "type."

  Added index entries for "numeric sequence type" and
  "character sequence type" in 5.5.1 and 16.4.3.3.

  "bindind" -> "bindings" in Note 4.48.

  [59:3] ", and" -> "; it"

  [60:2,23] Removed space in "<keyword> =" (4 times); otherwise it
  is confusing to parse.

  [84: last line of note 5.20] "this" -> "thus"

  [81:4,6] Bolded the instance of "VOLATILE attribute" on line 4
  instead of the one on line 6.

  [85:18] Added a comma.

  [91:9] Deleted extra "statement".

  [381:3] 6.5.5.3->6.7.5.3

  [105:18+] Hyphen changed to em-dash in last line of Note 6.4.

EDITS NOT DONE

  James Giles noted that there is no index entry for CLASS
  (other than one for "class" pointing to the glossary).  Seems
  like there ought to be, but I didn't track down where.

  Several people have suggested that the main index (Annex D)
  be moved to be the last Annex.  Seems like a reasonable idea
  and is easy, but I'll let J3 tell me to do that one instead
  of just doing it on my own.
