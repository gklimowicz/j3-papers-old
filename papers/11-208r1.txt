Subject:   CFI_select_part
Date: 2011 June 29
Reference: N1854


During the meeting, it was pointed out that the proposal in 11-168
means that the attribute argument to CFI_select_part is unnecessary
since the resulting C descriptor is already established with the correct
attribute.  It is therefore removed.  Similarly, the type argument is
also not needed, and is removed.

Additionally, the element length will be set in result for all cases
except character type. The current description also allows
CFI_type_other, which is not correct.

[18:5] Delete "CFI_type_t type,".

[18:15] Delete description of attribute argument.

[18:16] Delete description of the type argument.

[18:21] In the first sentence of the elem_len argument, delete

[18:21-23] In elem_len, delete the second sentence.

[18:28-29] Replace the last sentence of 5.2.5.8 para 3 with "In the C
descriptor pointed to by result, the attribute member shall be
CFI_attribute_assumed or CFI_attribute_pointer and the type member
shall be the specifier for the type of the part."

[18:30-31] Replace "the object ... established" with "the C descriptor
pointed to by result is updated"

[18:31] Replace "object" with "C descriptor".

[19:2-4] Replace CFI_select_part call (and blank line before) with:

 "CFI_cdesc_t * comp_cdesc = (CFI_cdesc_t *)&component;
  CFI_index_t extent[] = {100};

  ind = CFI_establish (comp_cdesc, NULL, CFI_attribute_assumed,
        CFI_type_double_complex, sizeof(double _Complex), 1, extent);

  ind = CFI_select_part (comp_cdesc, source, offsetof(t,y), 0);"
