1. Introduction

This is the J3 paper with edits, responding to the comments.
It is not the official response document.


2. Responses

JP-002. Agreed.

JP-003. Agreed.

JP-004. Deferred to a separate paper.

JP-005. Agreed.

JP-006. Agreed.

JP-007. Agreed. We will delete dimension-spec.

JP-008. Both "proc-entity-name" and "procedure-entity-name" have the syntax
        of "name", by our assumed syntax rules (4.1.3). The wording
        "proc-entity" and "procedure-entity" convey no semantics other than
        what is said in the separate subclauses.

        These two syntax terms have different usages and semantics; the
        proc-entity-name is only required to be the name of a procedure
        that has the EXTERNAL attribute, but procedure-entity-name has many
        requirements based on its usage in the procedure declaration
        statement.

        We agree that having two different BNF terms with such similar
        names is confusing. As proc-entity-name is only used in the
        declaration of a procedure pointer, we will change it to
        procptr-entity-name.

JP-009. Agreed.


3. Edits to 22-007r1

[16:29] 3.112.4 module procedure,
        Move "(R1408)" from the end of the sentence
        to follow the word "subprogram".
This results in the definition becoming:
    "procedure defined by a module subprogram (R1408), or a specific
     procedure provided by an intrinsic module".
{JP-002.}

[19:37] 3.183.3 unspecified storage unit,
        After "double precision real,"
        insert "default integer,".
This results in the definition becoming
    "unit of storage that holds a value that is not default character,
     default real, double precision real, default integer, default logical,
     or default complex (19.5.3.2)"
{JP-003.}

{102:1-2] 8.5.6.1 General (in 8.5.6 CODIMENSION attribute), C825,
          Change "associate name, a dummy argument"
          to "associate name or a dummy argument".
This makes that whole constraint read
    "C826 A coarray or an object with a coarray potential subobject
     component shall be an associate name or a dummy argument, or have the
     ALLOCATABLE or SAVE attribute."
{JP-006.}

[104:7] 8.5.8.1 General (in 8.5.8 DIMENSION attribute),
        Delete "R814 dimension-spec is DIMENSION ( array-spec )".
{JP-007.}

[114:13] 8.5.20 VOLATILE attribute, p2, last sentence,
         "between between" -> "between".
{JP-005.}

[119:26] 8.6.12 POINTER statement, R858 pointer-decl,
         Change "proc-entity-name" to "procptr-entity-name".
[120:1] Same subclause, C892, same change.
{JP-008.}

[554:8] Annex A,
        bullet beginning "the interaction between argument",
        delete comma after "pointer association".
{JP-009.}
