Subject:    Addressing comments in 02-209 concerning 02-174r2

    JOR reviewed the proposed edits in 02-216.  JOR decided not to
    do the last three edits because the wording of using syntax
    terms becoming defined or being assigned a value is used
    throughout the document.

[205:2]     Remove bold from "suitable generic interface".
