NUMBER: TBD
TITLE: TARGET and coindexed arguments
KEYWORD: TARGET, coindexing
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following program conforming and required to print 10, 10, 10
and 123, 123, 123?

PROGRAM Main
    INTEGER, TARGET :: coarray(3)[*]
    coarray = 10*THIS_IMAGE()
    IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) THEN
        SYNC ALL
        coarray = 123
        SYNC ALL
    ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 2) THEN
        CALL Fred(coarray(:)[1])
    ELSE
        SYNC ALL
        SYNC ALL
    END IF
CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE Fred (arg)
        INTEGER, TARGET :: arg(:)
        PRINT *, arg
        SYNC ALL
        SYNC ALL
        PRINT *, arg
    END SUBROUTINE Fred
END PROGRAM Main


DISCUSSION:

12.5.2.13p1(3)(b) and (4)(b) do not exclude this case, but it is hard to
see how it could be implemented without severe impact on ordinary code.


ANSWER:

The program is not intended to be conforming.  Edits are provided to
correct this oversight.


EDITS:

[300] 12.5.2.13p1(3)(b) append to the end of the paragraph "or a
coindexed object".

[300] 12.5.2.13p1(4)(b) append to the end of the paragraph "or a
coindexed object".
