Discussion
==========

As interpretation F18/018 remarks, C8105 appears not to serve any useful
purpose.

For context, the interpretation asked to consider

  Module m1
    Real,Public :: x
  End Module
  Module m2
    Use m1
    Private x
    Namelist/nml/x
  End Module

and

C8105 (R868) A <namelist-group-object> shall not have the PRIVATE
      attribute if the <namelist-group-name> has the PUBLIC attribute.

It seems that C8105 was based upon the premise that NAMELIST somehow gives
access to the OBJECT identified by the <namelist-group-object> identifier,
in a using scope, and that that (for some reason) ought to be prohibited.

But PRIVATE restricts use-association access to an identifier, not to the
identified object.

The NAMELIST statement does not change the accessibility of a
<namelist-group-object> identifier.

C8105 makes no sense.

Edits
=====

[119:8-9 C8105] Remove C8105.

Add a remark about this somewhere in the introduction, which I assume will
be entirely different from 18-007r1 in the next revision.
