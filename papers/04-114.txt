Subject: Use, not:


When using a large module with many symbols, there may be one
or a few names which give name collisions.  Rather than the ugle
rename to an unlikely name (zzzzzzzz => cbrt), a way of specifying
a list of names to not have use association would be preferred.

Title: USE, NOT:

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References:

Basic Functionality: A syntax to list names not to have use association
                     when using a module.

Rationale:  When using a module with many public names, a few may be
            unwanted.  Specifying those few is easier than naming
            the many wanted names, and less ugly than fanciful renames.

Estimated Impact: Compilers would have to recognize one more keyword
                  on use statements, and prune the list accordingly.

Detailed Specification: Add a not: clause to the use statement.
                        It should parallel, as much as possible,
                        the only: clause already there.

                        Example:

                        USE BIG_HONKING_MODULE, NOT: FUBAR, SNAFU

                        Not should be compatible with renames,
                        and mutually exclusive with only:.
