Subject: Comments on interface bodies and external procedures
Date: 28 February 2002

Section 1 Introduction

It is explicitly stated in the second paragraph of C.9.3 that the
standard allows that a name declared by an interface body need not imply
that an external procedure of the same name is part of the program.  Many
processors behave in the way therein described.  The second normative
paragraph of 12.3.2.1 (after the syntax rules) appears directly to
contradict this intent.

I like Richard Maine's idea, articulated in pre-meeting e-mail message
j3.2002-53, that an interface body is a local entity.  If there is an
external procedure, \st{proc-target}, or actual argument of the same name,
the interface body specifies its interface.  This has the attraction that
all interface bodies become local names, as opposed to some being global
and some being local.

Edits refer to 02-007

-----------------

76:31 [Editor: ``as ... (12.3.2.1)'' becomes ``both
as an interface body name (\ref{D12:Interface
block}) and as 
an actual argument, the
\si{procedure-name} in a \si{pointer-assignment-stmt}, or the
\si{procedure-name} in a \si{function-reference} or a \si{call-stmt}.
-----------------

245:16-17 [Editor: Delete ``for an existing external procedure
or a dummy procedure'' -- the ``existing external procedure'' part
appears to contradict the second paragraph of C.9.3.]
-----------------

245:17-18 [Editor: ``If ... such'' becomes ``The name
of an interface body {index\{name!interface body} is the
\si{function-name} in the \si{function-stmt} or the \si{subroutine-name}
in the \si{subroutine-stmt} that introduces the interface body.  If the
name of''.]
-----------------

245:20-21 [Editor: ``; otherwise ... interface''
becomes ``.  If an interface body name is accessible in a scoping
unit and is the same as a name used as an actual argument, the
\si{procedure-name} in a \si{pointer-assignment-stmt}, or the
\si{procedure-name} in a \si{function-reference} or a \si{call-stmt}, the
referenced name has the explicit specific interface specified by the
named interface body''.]
-----------------

382:6 [Editor: ``abstract interfaces'' becomes
``interface bodies''.]
-----------------

382:12 [Editor: Insert ``or interface body name'' before
``(12.3.2.1)''.]
-----------------


387:32 Replace item (12) with
"(12) The name of an interface body;"
