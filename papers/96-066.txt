                                                            X3J3/96-066

Date:     April 5, 1996
To:       X3J3
From:     Jerrold L. Wagener
Subject:  1995 X3J3 Annual Report


This is the draft annual report for (the second half of) 1995.  We're back on 
schedule and I will be presenting the annual report to the OMC on May 9. 
(Recall that the last report was delayed until Sept from its usual May time).

Larry, Dick, and Joel have had an opportunity to review this, and I would now 
like to make it available to all the members for review and suggestions.  
(Note that the officers section includes addresses - I have an outstanding 
action item to determine if full addresses are required in this section - they 
are.)  I'll do my best to incorporate any suggestions that I get by a week 
from now, Apr 12.

You've seen the format before - most of the stuff is proforma and not very 
interesting.  But section 5 is new (Future Trends ...), and something you 
might be interested in commenting on.  I put something in there, so that it 
wouldn't be blank, but I wasn't very expansive - probably this is a section 
that could use some help.

Last September the OMC asked me about the recommendation to withdraw Fortran 
77.  I told them that we were waiting for a response to our letter to NIST 
(we're still waiting).  I suspect now that we will not get a response, and we 
owe X3 something on this matter.  Though I have not put anything on this in 
the annual report, and don't plan to, I do plan to discuss this with the OMC 
on May 9 and find out what they would like to see.  In the meantime, let's 
plan on revisiting this issue at the May X3J3 meeting.  The relevant past 
papers are 95-048 and 95-056 from the January 1995 meeting in Houston and 
papers 94-073, 94-112, and 94-153 from the early part of 1994; please bring 
these papers with you to the meeting, and we can go from there.

X3 Subgroup Annual Report
 
Annual Report for: 					X3J3

Covering the Period from:					July 1995		to:
	April 1996
 
Title of X3 Subgroup: 					Fortran
 
Informal Description of Work:					no change from the 
SD-1B

1. Exective Summary: Since the last annual report the CD Ballot on Fortran 95 
has passed and the DIS ballot is about to begin. X3J3 delivered the draft 
standard to WG5 on schedule for both ballots. The US voted NO on the CD ballot 
(the only country to do so), but the issues were minor and readily resolved by 
WG5 in November 1995. Preliminary planning is beginning on Fortran 2000; WG5 
has initiated three "fast track" technical reports intended to be incorporated 
into Fortran 2000 and the remaining requirements for Fortran 2000 will be 
established by WG5 in July 1996. X3J3 will be the principal deveolpment body 
for Fortran 2000. Maintenance of Fortran 90 continues, though the volume is 
considerably less than a couple of years ago. Generally, the five-year 
revision strategy started with the adoption of Fortran 90 is progressing 
successfully.

a.	Project Number and Title: 0966-I				, Programming 
Language Fortran 9x.
b.	Target Date (Milestone 4): ISO CD passed in November 1995.
c.	Project Description: This project specifies revision and consolidation 
of the ANSI and ISO Fortran 90 standards, X3.198-1992 and ISO/IEC 1539:1991, 
in the 1995-96 timeframe. The project resulted from the decision in the 
international Fortran community to produce a short-term revision of ISO/IEC 
1539:1991 and to request X3J3 to develop the revision. This is a minor 
revision of Fortran 90, consisting mainly of incorporating the Fortran 90 
defect management activities of correction, clarification, and interpretation 
of Fortran 90, removing certain restrictions in Fortran 90, and adding a few 
new features of particular demand in the Fortran community.
d.	Publications During Past Year: 
	X3J3/95-000		X3J3 Document Register for 1995
	X3J3/95-004		Journal of Requirements for Fortran 95 
	X3J3/95-007		Fortran 95 Draft Standard (Committee Working 
Document)

	X3J3/96-		Minutes of Meeting 136
e.	Progress During Year: Documents 95-004 and 95-007 were produced which, 
respectively, represent the US (technical) requirements for Fortran 95 and the 
status of the Fortran 95 draft standard. 95-004 was an important contribution 
to the WG5 requirements process for Fortran 95. 95-007 is the Committee Draft 
document that was approved by CD ballot in November 1995.
f.	Status as of this Report: Awaiting WG5 initiation of the DIS ballot.
g.	Future Plans: X3J3's work on the development of the Fortran 95 draft 
standard is completed. WG5 has invited X3J3 to be the maintenance body for 
Fortran 95; X3J3 has indicated to WG5 that it will accept this invitation.
h.	Reasons for Delay: No delay - the document was delivered exactly on

4. Anticipated Projects: WG5 has scheduled a future revision of standard 
Fortran for the 2000-2001 time frame and informally currently referred to as 
Fortran 2000. X3J3 has been invited to be the prinicipal development body for 
Fortran 2000 (as it was for Fortran 95); this invitation has been tentatively 
accepted, and therefore X3J3 will be proposing a new I project in the near 
future. As principal development body, X3J3 will be responsible for the 
technical development of all Fortran 2000 requirements other than the 
technical reports assigned by WG5 to other bodies, and the integration of all 
material, including the technical reports, into the draft standard. At present 
WG5 has initiated three such technical reports - those approved by SC22 in 
September 1995: (1) floating point exception handling, (2) interoperability 
with C, and (3) allocatable array extensions. The other requirements for 
Fortran 2000 will be determined at the WG5 meeting in July 1996; this is 
expected to be an extensive list, as Fortran 2000 is planned as a more 
extensive revision than was Fortran 95.

5. Future Trends in Area of Standardization:
a.	3-5 Year Vision: Fortran will maintain/increase its leadership in high 
performance numerical computation.
b.	Emerging Technologies: High performance parallel architectures of 
various kinds.
c.	Closely-related Activities: High Performance Fortran Forum.
