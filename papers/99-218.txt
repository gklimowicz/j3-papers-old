Subject: Interpretation request 72 on generic procedures and elementals

TITLE:  Resolving generic procedure references
KEYWORDS: generic, ELEMENTAL
DEFECT TYPE:

QUESTION:

Consider
  INTERFACE generic
    ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE sub_e(a)
      REAL,INTENT(INOUT) :: a
    END
    SUBROUTINE sub_3(a)
      REAL,INTENT(INOUT) :: a(:,:,:)
    END
  END INTERFACE

This is legal (it obeys the restrictions in 14.1.2.3).

This allows the ambiguous reference
  REAL x(10,20,30)
  CALL generic(x)

However, the existing text in 14.1.2.4.1 does not explain which procedure is
called, because the reference is consistent with two procedures.  Note 14.6
indicates that the intent is to call the non-elemental procedure in this case.

Is note 14.6 correct as to the intent of the standard?

ANSWER:

Yes, note 14.6 is correct; an edit is supplied to the resolution rules to
implement this.

EDIT:

[278:41] After "with" insert "a non-elemental reference to".
