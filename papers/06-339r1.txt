This is a reworking of paper 06-278 which was deferred
from meeting 177.

[42:7+ note 4.1, last sentence] Are (type bound?)
generics resolvable at compile time?

[42:20-22] Add UDDTIO to the list. It can change
the parameters


[50:27] Add "elemental," to the list. Back in the good old
days, an elemental function was pure, so it wasn't
needed in the list. Now, we have IMPURE elemental
functions.

[61:23 and 30] I believe C449 and C453 are incorrect, but
I don't understand what they are trying to do.

[63:note 4.33 end] Can UDDTIO also determine the shape?

[64:22] Should C461 be worded similar to C449? It seems to be
about the same things.
