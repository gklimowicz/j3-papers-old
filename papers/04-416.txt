Subject: Interp request on stop codes

NUMBER: 
TITLE: What kind of token is a stop code?
KEYWORDS: STOP, token
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The <stop-code>, when it is a string of <digit>s, does not appear to be
specified by the standard to be any particular kind of token.  Or indeed
whether it is one token per <digit> or one per <stop-code>.

The answer to these questions determines whether blanks are allowed,
disallowed, or optional, in the middle of a STOP statement in free form.

Consider the following statements:
(1) STOP 123
(2) STOP123
(3) STOP 1 2 3

Which, if any, of these statements are standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Only statement (1) was intended to be standard-conforming.
Edits are supplied to clarify the situation.

EDITS:

[170:23] Replace with "<<or>> <int-literal-constant>"

[170:24+] Insert new constraint
 "C834a (R850) The <int-literal-constant> shall not have a <kind_param>
        and shall not have more than 5 <digit>s."

[170:27] After "significant" insert
  "and all stop codes are permissible even if not representable in the
   default integer type"
{Maybe some day we should think about requiring default integers to be
useful instead of having this here?}
