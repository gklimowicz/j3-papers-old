Subject: Editorial wording improvement
Date: 2013 October 15
Reference: 13-211r1

1. Introduction
---------------

The wording in 5.3.4p4 and 5.3.19p2 permitting an object to have the
ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE attribute within a BLOCK construct scoping unit
might be confusing if there is some other requirement that prohibits the
object from having the attribute.


2. Edits to 10-007r1
--------------------

{Avoid even the appearance of giving permission.}

[90:21-23] Replace sentence "Within ... construct." with
  "Specifying the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute within a BLOCK construct for an
   object whose scope is wider than that of the BLOCK construct does not
   confer the attribute on the object whilst outside the BLOCK construct.".

[102:14-16] Replace sentence "Within ... construct." with
  "Specifying the VOLATILE attribute within a BLOCK construct for an object
   whose scope is wider than that of the BLOCK construct does not confer
   the attribute on the object whilst outside the BLOCK construct.".

Note: An alternative formulation using more words would be
  "If an object that is not a local variable of a BLOCK construct is
   specified to have the XYZ attribute in the <specification-part>
   of the construct, the object has the attribute within the construct even
   if it does not have the attribute outside the construct.".


3. No wart removal
------------------

The claim in 13-311 that the VOLATILE VALUE proposal was not added to
13-244r1 is mistaken; it was US proposal 11 in that paper.

The further claim that it was "therefore not taken up at Delft" is also
mistaken, as the entire WG5 committee explicitly voted to defer
consideration of US-11 along with many other proposals: that vote passed
without any dissent.
