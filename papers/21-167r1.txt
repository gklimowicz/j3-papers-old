NUMBER: F18/032
TITLE: CO_BROADCAST and pointer components
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider the following program fragment:

    TYPE t
        CHARACTER(100) name
        REAL location(3)
        TYPE(t),POINTER :: antecedent
    END TYPE
    TYPE(t) x
    INTEGER src_image
    ...
    CALL co_broadcast(x,src_image)

On every image other than src_image itself, this will leave x with its
antecedent component having an undefined pointer association status
(except when it is disassociated on src_image).
This would seem to be not useful and likely to lead to further errors.

Was it intended to permit the A argument of CO_BROADCAST to have an
ultimate pointer component?

ANSWER: 

Yes, this was intended. Otherwise, individual CO_BROADCAST executions
would be required for every other component; this would be very
inconvenient.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

None.
