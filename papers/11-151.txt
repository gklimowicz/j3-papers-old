DISCUSSION

The names in Table 5.2 in the column "C Type" do not match the
corresponding names in Table 15.2 of 10-007r1. Table 5.2 in N1838
should be updated to use the names of C types as specified in
10-007r1.

Paper 11-124r2 missed an edit in the paragraph before Table 5.2.

Edits are provided to correct these issues.


EDITS to N1838:

[12:7-8] In 5.2.5 Macros, para 7, replace the second sentence:

"The values for CFI_type_struct and CFI_type_unspecified shall be
distinct and distinct from all the other type specifiers."

with

"The values for CFI_type_other shall be distinct from all the other
type specifiers."
