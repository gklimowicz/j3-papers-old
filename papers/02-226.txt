Subject:  UI 370

In Unresolved Issue 370 the Editor complained that we botched
use of the term "type-param-value".

This paper attempts to fix what the Editor wants fixed.
Hopefully, if I haven't succeeded, J3 will do so via email
before the meeting.

Edits:

72:26 Change "<type-param-value> (5.1.1.5) is an expression"
to "<type-param-value> (4.2) specifying a <length-selector>
is an expression"

72:28+ Add paragraph
"If a <type-param-value> (4.2) appearing in a
<type-param-name-list> (4.5.1) is an expression that
is not an initialization expression, the value is
specified at the entry of the procedure and is not affected
by any redefinition or undefinition of the
variables in the specification expression
during execution of the procedure."
