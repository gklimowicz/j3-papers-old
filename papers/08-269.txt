Subject: PC J32027 becomes an Interp
Date: 2008 August 14

Robert Corbett submitted Public Comment J32027,
which was answered by /Data in 08-241r1 as being
an appropriate topic of an Interp.

I reformatted the PC as an Interp to offload
some work from an overworked /Data at m185.

QUESTION:

Consider the program:

       PROGRAM MAIN
         TYPE T1
           SEQUENCE
           INTEGER I, J
         END TYPE
         TYPE T2
           SEQUENCE
           INTEGER I, J
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T1) X, Y
         EQUIVALENCE (I, X, Y)
         X%J = 2
         I = 1
         PRINT *, I, X, Y
       END

The assignment to the variable I causes I, X, and Y
to become defined (see items (1) and (15) of
Section 16.6.5).  Therefore, according to item (1)
of Section 16.6.6, I, X, and Y become undefined.

ANSWER:

Item (1) of Section 16.6.6 should be modified so that
it directly applies only to ultimate components.  The
effect on aggregate types will then occur as is
appropriate because of the rules given in
Section 16.6.1.

EDITS:

none proposed
