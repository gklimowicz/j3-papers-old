Subject: IMPORT, NONE constraint too restrictive
Date: 2017 May 19



Discussion:

8.8 IMPORT statement constraint C897 states "IMPORT, NONE shall not
appear in a submodule."  This means you cannot use IMPORT, NONE in a
module procedure in a submodule, or in an interface body in the
submodule.



Edit to 17-007r1:
 8.8 IMPORT statement

[123:11]

Replace constraint C897 with
  "IMPORT, NONE shall not appear in the specification part of a
   submodule except within an interface body."
