Introduction:
=============

The newly introduced type specifiers, TYPEOF(data-ref) and
CLASSOF(data-ref), allow some problematic/contradictory declarations
for certain data-refs.

Problem 1: Type/kind parameters for a data-ref declared as OPTIONAL.
----------

The current draft allows this case:
CHARACTER(*),OPTIONAL :: x
TYPEOF(x) :: y ! Allowed (but should not be)

Two possible fixes were suggested when UTI-013 was created.  The first
is to require data-ref to be a restricted expression.  The second was
to disallow optional dummy variables.

This paper argues that both of the suggested changes are too strict.
Perfectly sensible use cases involving optional dummy arguments can be
readily constructed.


Problem 2: TYPEOF with TYPE(*) data ref
---------

UTI-014 notes that this case is disallowed by C711 and C714, but asks
if we wish to permit it.  The answer in this paper is an unqualified
"no".

Problem 3: CLASSOF  with CLASS(*) data ref
----------

UTI-014 correctly points out that this case is not disallowed by
existing constraints and asks if we want it to be allowed.  It notes
that the normative text for CLASSOF is in terms of declared type which
is contradictory for the CLASS(*) case:

[56:38-39]
"TYPEOF and CLASSOF specify the same type and type parameter values as
the declared type and type parameter values of data-ref, except that
they specify that a type parameter is deferred if it is deferred in
data-ref."

But [57:19-21] has
"An entity declared with the CLASS(*) specifier is an unlimited
polymorphic entity. It is not declared to have a type, and is not
considered to have the same declared type as any other entity,
including another unlimited polymorphic entity."

The answer in this paper is that this case should be allowed and edits
are provided to eliminate the contradictory language.  The rationale
is that there are seemingly reasonable use cases involving CLASS(*).
E.g. imagine an include file that provides a "template" for a
container of some sort:

"
...
TYPE ELEMENT
   CLASSOF(y), ALLOCATABLE :: ITEM
END TYPE
TYPE LIST
   TYPE(ELEMENT), ALLOCATABLE :: ITEMS(:)
END TYPE
...
"

This include file could readily be used to define a LIST of objects of
class Foo:

...
TYPE(FOO) :: Y
INCLUDE 'template.inc'
...

or unlimited polymorphic entities

...
CLASS(*), ALLOCATABLE :: y
INCLUDE 'template.inc'
...


Edits:
======
[56:28 7.3.2.1 Type specifier syntax

After "the CLASS" insert "or CLASSOF" such that the full sentence
then reads:

" 
An entity declared with the CLASS or CLASSOF keyword shall be a dummy
argument or have the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute.
"

[56:35+ 7.3.2.1 Type specifier syntax: insert a new constraint:

"
C713+ If data-ref in a TYPEOF or CLASSOF specifier has the OPTIONAL
attribute, it shall not have deferred or assumed type
parameters.
"

[56:38 7.3.2.1 Type specifier syntax:

Before "TYPEOF", insert "If data-ref is not unlimited polymorphic, ".

[56:39 7.3.2.1 Type specifier syntax: append new sentence:

"
If data-ref is CLASS(*), CLASSOF(data-ref) is equivalent to a
CLASS(*) specifier.
"

Such that the resulting paragraph reads:

"
If data-ref is not unlimited polymorphic, TYPEOF and CLASSOF specify
the same type and type parameter values as the declared type and type
parameter values of data-ref, except that they specify that a type
parameter is deferred if it is deferred in data-ref.  If data-ref is
CLASS(*),  CLASSOF(data-ref) is equivalent to CLASS(*).
