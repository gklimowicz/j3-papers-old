Discussion:

Constraint C1288 [310:p2+] contains a list of intrinsic functions that
are exempt from the restriction that they not appear in a
<specification-expr> in an elemental procedure if the argument to the
intrinsic function is a dummy argument. The common feature of these
functions is that their result value depends on the type of the
argument, but not its value. The new STORAGE_SIZE intrinsic shares
this feature and should be included in the list.  I suspect its
omission was an integration oversight.


Edits to J3/08-007r2 (WG5/N1723):

[310:p2:C1288] In 12.8.1 "Elemental procedure declaration and
interface", para 2, third constraint: after "RANGE, " insert
"STORAGE_SIZE, ".
