Subject:   Interpretation concerning CLASS and prior type definition

NUMBER: F08/0129
TITLE: Is CLASS(type) required to refer to a prior type definition?
KEYWORDS: CLASS, type definition
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Does the CLASS(T) declaration of X in the following conform?

recursive subroutine S ( N, X )
  integer :: N
  class(t), optional :: X
  type :: T
    integer :: Q
  end type T
...

ANSWER:

Although subclause 4.3.1.3 does not require the <derived-type-spec> in a
CLASS specifier to refer to a previously-defined type, it was intended
that CLASS declarations with <derived-type-spec> be parallel to TYPE
declarations.  In a TYPE declaration (4.3.1.2), the specified derived
type is required to be previously defined, or accessed by use or host
association.  Therefore the example ought not to conform.  Edits are
provided to correct this oversight.

EDITS:

[12-007:6+ 4.3.1.3p1+] Insert a paragraph:

"Where a data entity other than a component is declared explicitly using
the CLASS specifier to be of derived type, the specified derived type
shall have been defined previously.  If the data entity is a function
result, the derived type may be specified in the FUNCTION statement
provided the derived type is defined within the body of the function or
is accessible there by use or host association.  If the derived type is
specified in the FUNCTION statement and is defined within the body of
the function, it is as if the function result variable were declared
with that derived type immediately following the <derived-type-def> of
the specified derived type."

{This is essentially identical to 4.3.1.2p1, except for the replacement
of "TYPE" with "CLASS" and the addition of "other than a component"
(4.3.1.2p1 does not mention components, but it ought to because
otherwise it would contradict C440), but that's a different question.}
