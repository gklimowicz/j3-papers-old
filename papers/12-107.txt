7.1.11p5 in 10-007r1 prohibits a specification function from being an
internal function, and from having a dummy procedure argument.  It
would be sufficient to prohibit evaluation of a specification
expression from invoking a procedure internal to the same instance of
the subprogram in which the specification expression is evaluated.

The prohibition in 7.1.11p5 in 10-007r1 against a specification
function having a dummy procedure argument is pointless, because it
does not prohibit it from having an argument of a type that has a
procedure pointer component, or a type with a type-bound procedure that
has a dummy procedure argument.  The procedure pointer component, or
the argument of the type bound procedure, could designate an internal
procedure.

The assertion in Note 7.32 that prohibiting a specification function
from being an internal function ensures that they cannot inquire, via
host association, about other objects being declared in the same
<specification-part> is true, but pointless, since there are ways to
invoke an internal procedure, by way of a specification function, that
could in principle inquire or reference such variables.

Proposed Edits to 10-007r1
--------------------------

[10-007r1:150:29 7.1.11p2(11)] Insert "data" before "argument".

[10-007r1:150:44-45 7.1.11p5] Replace the paragraph by
"A function is a specification function if it is a pure function,
\obs{is not a statement function,} and is not a standard intrinsic
function."

[10-007r1:7.1.11p6 151:1-2] Insert ", or an instance of one that is
internal to the same instance in which the specification expression is
evaluated," after "subprogram".

[10-007r1:7.1.11 Note 7.32 151:2+4-5] Replace "they not be internal
ensures that they cannot" by "evaluation of a specification
expression not invoke a procedure internal to the instance of the
subprogram in which it appears ensures that it is not possible to"

Alternative Edits to 10-007r1
-----------------------------

[10-007r1:150:29 7.1.11p2(11)] Insert "data" before "argument".

[10-007r1:150:44-45 7.1.11p5] Replace the paragraph by
"A function is a specification function if it is a pure function,
\obs{is not a statement function,} and is not a standard intrinsic
function."

[10-007r1:7.1.11p6 151:2] Append before the end of the sentence ", and
shall not reference or inquire about an automatic variable whose
declaration contains the specification expression, or one declared after
the appearance of the specification expression and within the same
instance of the <specification-part> in which the specification
expression appears".

[10-007r1:7.1.11 Note 7.32 151:2+4-6] Delete the sentence that begins
with "The requirement that they not be internal...."
