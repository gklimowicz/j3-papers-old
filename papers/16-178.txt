----------

The text for FORM TEAM (8.6.9) makes it clear that execution of
FORM TEAM involves the synchronization of all the active images of
the current team. Therefore, all that is needed is to change "same
execution" to "synchronized executions". It will also be helpful to
refer to 8.6.9.

Edit to J3/16-007r1
-------------------

[177:25] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, para 2, sentence 1, replace
"same execution" by "synchronized executions" and add "(8.6.9)" at the
end of the sentence.
