1. Introduction

Please use the following Foreword.

(Text omitted from this paper.)


2. Response

Accepted.


3. Edit to N2146

Replace current Foreword with latest text from ISO Secretariat, with
additional text following "The main changes ... are as follows:"
being

   "The Technical Specifications [refer to TS 29113 and TS 18508] have
    been incorporated.  Support for [refer to 60559] has been updated
    to the 2011 standard."

(The editor does not think any other individual item is sufficiently
 "major" to warrant inclusion in the Foreword, and could be persuaded
 to leave the 60559 update out of it too.)
