1. Introduction
---------------

C514 at [10-007r1:89:19] specifies that an entity shall not explicitly
be given an attribute more than once in a scoping unit.

5.2.1p2 at [10-007r1:88:1-4] says that the type declaration statement
specifies the attributes whose keywords appear in the <attr-spec>,
except that the DIMENSION attribute may be specified or overridden by
the appearance of <array-spec> in its <entity-decl>, and the CODIMENSION
attribute may be specified or overridden for an entity by the appearance
of <coarray-spec> in its <entity-decl>.

4.4.4.2p4 at [10-007r1:58:7-11] operates similarly for character type,
except that this is a type parameter, not an attribute, so not covered
by C514.

This has confused a few readers who find C514, do not look further to
find 5.2.1p2, and then assume that

  real, dimension(:,:) :: A(10,2)

is an error that the compiler failed to detect.

2. Repair
---------

The wording of in 5.2.1p2 implies that the DIMENSION or CODIMENSION
<attr-spec> in the <type-declaration-stmt> specifies a default for the
dimension or codimension attribute, which only applies if <array-spec>
or <coarray-spec> does not appear in the <entity-decl>.  Mention this in
a note after C514.

4. Edits
--------

[C514+ 10-007r1:89:19+] Insert a note:

"NOTE 5.1a
  If the DIMENSION or CODIMENSION <attr-spec> appears in a
  <type-declaration-stmt> it specifies a default for the attribute that
  is used only if an <array-spec> or <coarray-spec> does not appear in
  the <entity-decl>."
