Issue 282 complains about a fairly unintelligible paragraph of section 12.5.3.  
The following edit replaces the paragraph.

Edit: 272:39-43 replace paragraph with:

	"A procedure may be defined by means other than Fortran.   The 
	interface of a procedure defined by means other than Fortran may 
	be specified in an interface block.  If the interface of such a 
	procedure does not have a <language-binding-spec>, the means by 
	which the procedure is defined are processor dependent.  A 
	reference to such a procedure is made as though it were defined by 
	an external subprogram."

Delete issue 282

Edit: 273:1-7 delete
