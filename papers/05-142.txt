STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m

  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i
    INTEGER :: j
  END TYPE

  INTEGER :: ipos

  INTERFACE READ(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedReadT
  END INTERFACE

CONTAINS

  SUBROUTINE formattedReadT (dtv, unit, iotype, vlist, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: unit
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: iotype
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: vlist(:)
    INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: iostat
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

    READ(unit, *) dtv%i
    INQUIRE(unit, POS=ipos)
    READ(unit, *) dtv%j
  END SUBROUTINE

END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  TYPE(t) :: a
  OPEN(10, FILE='file.txt', ACCESS='stream', FORM='formatted')
  WRITE(10, '(A)') '2*3 5'
  REWIND(10)
  READ(10, *) a
  PRINT *, a%i, a%j, ipos
END PROGRAM


10.9 of Fortran 2003 states that the r*c form of list-directed input
is equivalent to r occurrences of c.  So, when the read is performed,
it is as if the input record contains two occurrences of the number 3.

The first child read statement reads the first 3, and does not advance
the file position to the next record (because it is a child data
transfer statement).  It appears that the second read statement should
read the second 3.  But the file position between the child read
statements is unclear.

What does the above program print?


ANSWER:

I'd like to say that an input item of the form r*c must be read by a
single data transfer statement (i.e. it can't be read by two separate
child statements, or by a combination of parent and child statements).
Any extra values caused by the repeat specifier would be discarded at
the end of the input statement.  That would seem to make the output
" 3 5 4", but I'm not at all sure that this is the right answer.

To instead have input values with repeat specifiers span multiple I/O
statements would add complexity to a run-time library, and we would
have to define what the file position would be between such
statements.


EDITS:

TBD.
