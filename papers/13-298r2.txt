NUMBER: F08/0099
TITLE: VOLATILE in specification expressions
KEYWORD: VOLATILE, specification expression
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation.
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following subprogram required always to print "T T"?

  subroutine Wobbly ( N )
    integer, volatile :: N
    integer :: A ( n, n )
    integer :: B ( n * n )
    print *, size(a) == size(b), size(a,1) == size(a,2)
  end subroutine Wobbly

ANSWER:

No.

There are three specification expressions in the subroutine, and the
volatile variable N appears in each of them.  Since, being volatile,
the variable N might have a different value each time it is
referenced, these three specification expressions might receive
different values for their references to N.  If that happens, the
array sizes might well be different.
