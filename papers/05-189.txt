Title: Named array constant's extents from its <initialization-expr>.


Status: Specification complete

References: 01-180, 04-101, 04-394r1

Basic Functionality:

  As with the length of a character named constant, allow an array
  named constant to get its extents from the <initialization-expr>.

Rationale:

  There was a good reason that a provision was made for named
  constants of character type to get their lengths from their
  <initialization-expr>s.  For the same reason, it would be useful if
  array named constants could get their extents from their
  <initialization-expr>s.

Estimated Impact:

  Small effect in 5.1.2.5.2, or maybe a short new subclause in
  5.1.2.5, to explain how an array named constant gets its extents
  from its <initialization-expr> (see item (2) in the list at the end
  of 4.4.4).

  Estimated at meeting 169 to be at 3 on the JKR scale.

Detailed Specification:

  Allow an array named constant to get its extents from the extents
  of its <initialization-expr>.  The ranks of the named constant and
  its <initialization-expr> shall be the same.  Use an asterisk for
  every dimension in the declaration of the named constant.

  See 01-180 for an example.
