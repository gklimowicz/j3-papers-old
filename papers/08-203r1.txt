Subject: DO CONCURRENT with <type-spec> isn't defined
Date: 2008 August 11
References: 08-007r2

[178: 8.1.7.6.1p7] -----------------------------------------------------
The possibility that <type-spec> might appear in the <forall-header> of
a DO CONCURRENT construct has not been considered.

Editor: Replace the paragraph by one parallel to 7.2.4.1p2:

"An <index-name> in a DO CONCURRENT construct has a scope of the
construct (16.4).  It is a scalar variable.  If <type-spec> appears, the
variable has the specified type and type parameters; otherwise it has
the type and type parameters it would have if it were the name of a
variable in the scoping unit that includes the DO CONCURRENT construct,
and this type shall be integer type; it has no other attributes."

Move this paragraph to page 176 after C819,
in 8.1.7.2 The Form of the DO Construct.
