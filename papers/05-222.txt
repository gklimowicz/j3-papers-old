Subject: Default initialization of INTENT(OUT), assumed-size arrays

NUMBER: F03/0060
TITLE: Default initialization of INTENT(OUT), assumed-size arrays
KEYWORDS: default initialization, INTENT(OUT), assumed size, polymorphism
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      MODULE m
        TYPE base
          INTEGER I
        END TYPE
        TYPE, EXTENDS(base) :: child
          INTEGER :: j = 5
        END TYPE
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE sub(b)
          CLASS(base), INTENT(OUT) :: b(*)
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

      PROGRAM foo
        USE m
        TYPE(child) :: c(3)
        c%i = 12
        c%j = 47
        CALL sub(c)
        PRINT *, c%j
      END PROGRAM

C544 prevents nonpolymorphic, INTENT(OUT), assumed-size arrays from
having default initialization.  The polymorphic case, however, is not
checkable at compile time, so it cannot be a constraint.

Was it intended that the dynamic type of an INTENT(OUT), assumed-size
array could have default initialization?  If so, what does the above
program print?


ANSWER:

No, it was not intended that the dynamic type of such an array could
have default initialization.  An edit is provided to correct this
oversight.

[80:9-10]  Create a new paragraph after the constraints in 5.1.2.5.4.
           This paragraph will consist of the text currently contained
           in C544.  Delete constraint C544.
