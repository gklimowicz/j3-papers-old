NUMBER: F08/0100
TITLE: IMPORT statement and prior explicit declaration
KEYWORD: IMPORT statement, prior explicit declaration
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Q1. Does the following program fragment conform to the 2008 standard?

  subroutine S ( P )
    interface
      subroutine Q ( X )
        real, intent(inout) :: X
      end subroutine Q
    end interface
    interface
      subroutine P ( A )
        import
        procedure (R) :: A
      end subroutine P
    end interface
    procedure (Q) :: R
  end subroutine S

12.4.3.3p2 says "If an entity that is made accessible by this means is
accessed by host association and is defined in the host scoping unit, it
shall be explicitly declared prior to the interface body."

However, although the procedure R is declared in the host scoping unit
it is not defined in the host scoping unit, so this is ineffective.

Q2. If the IMPORT statement were changed to "IMPORT R", would that be
    conforming?

12.4.3.3p1 says
  "An entity that is imported in this manner and is defined in the
   host scoping unit shall be explicitly declared prior to the
   interface body."

Again, procedure R is declared but not defined in the host scoping
unit, so this requirement is ineffective.

ANSWER:

These examples were not intended to conform to the Fortran standard.
An edit is provided.

EDITS:

[282:7] 12.4.3.3p1, after "imported in this manner and is"
        change "defined" to "declared".

[282:14] p2, after "is accessed by host association and is"
         change "defined" to "declared".
