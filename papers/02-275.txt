From:     Richard Maine
Subject:  Edits incorporated in 02-007R3

The editor expresses his thanks to the review subgroup
(John Reid, Dan Nagle, and Van Snyder) for their assistance
in reviewing his work on these edits (and for catching the
embarrasingly many errors that the editor initially made).

This paper describes the changes in J3/02-007R3 relative to the
previous f2k draft, J3/02-007R2.  All page/line references are
to J3/02-007R2 unless otherwise noted.

Comments from the editor are in a separate paper; this one
is restricted to changes made.

This includes edits from papers (all 02-):

  212, 214r1, 215r2, 216r1, 217, 218, 219r2, 220r1, 221r2,
  223r1, 224r2, 225r1, 230r3, 234r1, 236, 238r2, 239, 240r1,
  241r4, 242r2, 244r2, 245r2, 246r1, 247r1, 248r1, 249r1,
  250r1, 252r2, 253r2, 254r1,255r1, 257r1, 258r1, 259r1, 260,
  261r1, 262r1, 263r1, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269r1, 270,
  271r1

The following papers were done as is:

  212, 214r1, 218, 220r1, 221r2, 223r1, 225r1, 234r1, 236, 246r1,
  248r1, 253r2, 255r1, 257r1, 258r1, 260, 261r1, 264, 266, 265,
  267, 269r1, 270

The following papers were done with changes as noted.  All of the
changes done were on the order of typographical errors.  Two were
to fix incorrect typographical style in the use of colons; other
than those two, I haven't even attempted to fix questionable
grammar (since doing so can change technical meaning - as
illustrated by some of my comments in a separate paper).  There
were also some cases where the exact intent of J3 was unclear and
I have documented the guess that I made.

  paper 02-215r2

    Did not double the comma (clearly a typo).

  paper 02-216r1

    Also removed it from the index.  I believe that was the
    intent, but it was not made explicit in the edit.  Although it
    is possible to remove the bold without removing the index
    entry, I doubt that was the intent.  Indeed, the bizarre index
    entry was the main subject of the original question.

  paper 02-217

    Changed "and" to "but" and "context" to "contexts" per
    review subgroup.

  paper 02-219r2

    [43:31-44:5] Internal evidence suggests that the 44:5 was a typo
    for [44:3], as the next edit would otherwise be to a deleted line.
    Another paper later deletes [44:5], making that part of the issue
    moot.  Did not delete [44:5].  Applied the edit to it instead.
    Review subgroup agreed.

    [45:20] The constraint on this line is C458 rather than C457.
    I assume, based on the material, that the line number, rather
    than the constraint number, is correct.

    There is no explicit bnf definition of <arg-name> or
    <generic-name> (they are cases of the implicit *-name rule), so
    several \si in the tex source needed to be \sinr.  This
    disinction is invisible in the printed version of the paper,
    but it matters for the LaTeX.

  paper 02-224r2

   [260:19-20] Paper 02-244r2 made a different edit in this same
   place.  I assume that the edit in 02-224r2 overrides, as it
   was passed later.

  paper 02-230r3

    I assume that the para starting NOTE: is intended to be an
    informative note rather than normative text that actually
    says "NOTE:".  The material reads like a note, so I'll
    assume that was the intent.  Entered it that way.

    Fixed "; However" -> "; however"

    [383:14-17] 
    I don't know what it was intended for me to do with the two
    cases here.  Sort of looks like they go under the SHAPE
    argument, but that is nonsense.  There isn't any place much
    more sensible to put them though.  I just put them dangling
    not under any heading.  This doesn't match either the way
    we have done any other procedure descriptions or the way
    that ISO (or anyone else) asks that sectioning be done, but
    I can't figure out what else might have been intended.

    I omitted the period from the section titles in Annex C.

    I also omitted some of the colons before code sample,
    depending on the grammar of the lead-in.

  paper 02-238r2

    [81:14-17] I avoided doubling the "be", the "an", and the
    period.  I believe these to be typos.

    [253:25] I avoided doubling the comma (presumed to be a typo).

  paper 02-239

    [194:10+] Fixed in a prior paper.

    [523] I'm not sure what makes this different from the other
    Annexes (very messy TeX stuff).  I hacked it so that there
    is no run together here, but that makes extra space in all
    the other Annex headings - I guess extra space is better than
    the overlap.

  paper 02-240r1

    The material deleted by the 4th edit included an index entry
    (for attribute!POINTER) that was omitted from the tex of the
    replacing new para.  I assume this was accidental (and that
    reviewers didn't even look at the tex).  I moved this index
    entry to the new para instead of deleting it.

    [257:20] This was changed by some other paper.

  paper 02-241r4

    Did not duplicate "for a procedure" in the 19.5+ edit.
    (Clearly a typo).

    [416:24] Also added the 2.5.1 xref since this isn't now just a
    "see" entry.

    The answer to the question about a grave accent on 24:7 is
    yes; I've done so (with Van's help).

  paper 02-242r2

    [33: Note 4.1+1] According to the author, the explanatory
    "{No, correct as it stands}" was supposed to replace the
    editing instruction, but failed to do so because of a
    typographical error.  I thus obeyed the "No" part instead of
    the edit.

    [43:14] Added a "be" to make the sentence parse
    per review subgroup.

    [44:4,5] This duplicates an edit in another paper.

    [47:20] Did not double the period.

    [61:11] Also did "a" -> "an".

    [74:33-34] This is phrased as a comment instead of an editing
    instruction.  I believe it was intended as an instruction to
    change the obsolescent type to normal in these lines.

  paper 02-244r2

    257:20 I wasn't entirely sure whether it was intended that I
    take this edit literally (just delete) or to turn it into the
    index entry that this was originally a typo for.  Based on the
    observation that this would have been the only subindex entry
    under "name", I decided to take the instructions literally.
    (One could argue for having many such entries for names of
    various entities, but it seems odd to have only that one).

    260:12  There is no "}" to delete.  (Presumed typo)

    260:19-20 See comments on paper 02-224r2.

  paper 02-245r2

    [277:7-8] Italic for both cases of proc-language-binding-spec.
    (Clearly a typo).

  paper 02-247r1

    [46:5] I originally thought this trivial edit was a major
    technical blunder (as the resulting "Its" would have refered to
    the wrong thing).  However consultation with two subgroup
    members revealed that it was instead a simple typo in the line
    number.  Although there is an "A" on line [46:5], it was the
    one on [46:6] that was intended (and is so indicated on their
    hand-marked papers as opposed to the electronic one).  I made
    this correction.

  paper 02-249r1

    The paper says that 2 deep references to 13.8.3.1.3 "should" be
    changed to 13.8.3 for consistency, but this wasn't mentioned in
    the "proposed edits".  It wasn't entirely clear to me whether the
    intent of J3 in passing the paper was to do these changes or not.
    I guessed not, but I'm far from sure of that guess.  (They do
    seem like plausible changes - either that, or the various other
    references to 13.8.3 might be made "deep" ones, much like most of
    the references to intrinsic procedures in 13.7.x).

  paper 02-250r1

    [263:Note 12.14] I'm not sure of the intent here in regards to
    blank lines.  It sure looks funny and probably not as intended
    if I take the edits completely literally.  I'll assume that
    the edits also intended me to adjust blank line usage to one
    of several plausible styles.  I did so.

    [394:11-12] I'll assume the deletion of the comma was a typo;
    left it in.

  paper 02-252r2

    I'm not sure what the bold for dtv was intending to indicate.
    Code font is already (semi?-)bold.  I'll assume the bold
    was just a redundant indication of that, so I ignored it.

    LaTeX by default put the multi-level item xrefs like 3a, which
    I can easily enough put parens arund to make (3a).  I didn't
    try to figure out how to force it to make (3)(a), which is
    probably possible, but not worth the work.  (Of course, I
    could just type in the numbers directly - as I see was done in
    the deleted note, but then that would break on any
    renumbering).

  paper 02-254r1

    [20:20] Also added the necessary comma.

    [430:31] Also changed "an" -> "a".

  paper 02-259r1

    [46:Note 4.21] The first line in question was deleted by a
    previously passed edit in paper 02-247r1.  I assume that the
    code font edit for dim was intended to apply to both lines 16 and
    18, so I did so.

    [219:5] Our usual definition macro also creates an index entry.
    I guessed that was also desired here, so I did so, rather than
    just bolding the text.

    [249:7] Fixing this also changed the strange index entry for
    "*PUBLIC statement" to a reasonable one without the "*".  I
    don't think the index got much review, just like it hasn't
    gotten much attention all along.  But then doing a good index
    is a big job in itself.

    [266:14] Made the same change at [266:8].

    [xiii:10] Done in some other paper.

    [xii:21] I see no "derived type" on line 21 or anywhere in the
    area.  Not done.  There is a "deferred type" on line 21; that
    might have been what this referred to, but hyphenating that
    would be incorrect (and changing it to "derived-type" would
    also be incorrect).

    I also fixed a particularly egregious similar missing hyphen in
    the index (see above comments).  Changed "derived type type
    specifier" to "derived-type type specifier".  One could argue
    for also deleting the second type, but I didn't do so.  The
    former "type type" stood out pretty badly.

    Also fixed another index entry "derived type" -> "derived-type"
    in the subentry under "resolving procedure references".

    [77:17] This sentence deleted by another paper.

    Didn't put any of the colons after "then" or the one after
    "defined".  They are grammatically incorrect, contrary to
    ISO-specified style, and inconsistent with usages elsewhere in
    the draft. (this is the biggest place where I made grammatical
    corrections as editor).  I note J3 concurred with JOR's
    rejection of changes to insert colons on 11:50 and 13:9-13 (at
    least I assume that is what was proposed there).  I concur with
    J3 and JOR's rejection of the colons there, and I consider my
    rejection of the colons in these additional places to be
    consistent.  I believe that J3/JOR likely overlooked the
    similarity of these edits because they were listed under the
    heading of "If-then English statement" instead of under the
    heading of "Punctuation For Displayed Lists".  Yes, some lists
    use colons and others don't, just like some instances of
    "derived type" are hyphenated and others aren't.  The draft may
    well have errors in this area, just like it did for "derived
    type", but it is not the correct fix to add colons to all
    displayed lists any more than it would be the correct fix to
    hyphenate every occurrence of "derived type".

    The third "only" change on page 274 is a contradictory
    edit to the same line.  It proposes moving the "only" to
    a different incorrect place, giving a different incorrect
    meaning.  I can't move it to both places, so I didn't do
    this one.

  paper 02-262r1

    [219:1] This one was also done in another paper.

  paper 02-263r1

    [13:7] I'll assume that the omission of "block" after
    "abstract interface" was a typo, so I fixed it.  An interface
    block is not an abstract interface, though it may contain
    such.  See 12.3.2.1.

  paper 02-268

    [62:22] There is no such bnf term as <type-parameter-value>.
    I assume this was a typo for <type-param-value>.  Fixed.

  paper 02-271r1

    [264:32] Omission of the word "specific" assumed to be a typo.

    [293:27-28] Omission of "or" assumed to be a typo.

Things not in papers.

  Added Kurt's macros for bnf xrefs.  No visible effect on current
  document, but facilitates such xrefs either as another annex or
  a separate paper.

  Three unrelated typos found by the review subgroup

    [261:Note 12.10] Remove extra blank before "END INTERFACE"

    [263:Note 12.15] "ISO_C binding" -> "ISO_C_BINDING"

    [381:Note 15.2] "ISO_C" -> "ISO_C_BINDING"
