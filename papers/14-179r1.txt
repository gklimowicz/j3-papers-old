From:      Van Snyder
Subject:   UK proposal UK-17 Recursion by default
Date: 2014 June 24
Reference: 14-007r1


Status: For Consideration
Basic Functionality:
Make RECURSIVE the default for procedures.

Rationale:
It is annoying for the user to have to specify RECURSIVE for a procedure
that can call itself recursively.  Other high level languages have had
recursion as a default for many years; this is a stumbling block for new
users.

The trouble with the current situation is that if the compiler produces
non-recursion-capable code for a procedure that is not declared to be
RECURSIVE (e.g. by storing one or more local variables statically instead
of dynamically), and does not detect invalid recursion, the result is
silently wrong answers.

All standard-conforming compilers already implement recursion so the new
implementation effort required is minimal.

The restriction against elemental recursion was intended to make
elemental procedures easier to implement and optimise; this has outlived
its purpose, so edits are proposed to lift that restriction as well.

Specification:

All subprograms should by default have the RECURSIVE attribute.  A
NON_RECURSIVE prefix is provided to specify that a procedure is not
recursive.

Syntax:

RECURSIVE keyword becomes advisory only.  A NON_RECURSIVE keyword is
provided to specify that a procedure is not recursive.

Edits to J3/14-007r1(= N2014):

[xviii] Introduction paragraph 2, bullet "Programs and procedures",
  add as the final sentence:

    "Procedures, including elemental procedures, are allowed to be
    recursive by default.  The RECURSIVE keyword is advisory only. The
    NON_RECURSIVE keyword is provided to specify that a procedure is not
    recursive."

[224:0+9,10 9.6.4.8.2 Note 9.42] replace the final sentence "If ...
RECURSIVE" with:

  "If a defined input/output procedure calls itself indirectly in this
   manner, it shall be recursive."

[229:0+7 Note 9.49] Delete "RECURSIVE".

[307:15 R1226] After "<<or>> MODULE", insert an alternative:

     "       <<or>> NON_RECURSIVE"

[307:21 C1251 12.6.2.1] Within constraint C1251, replace "ELEMENTAL"
with "NON_RECURSIVE".

[307:31-32 C1257 12.6.2.1] Within constraint C1257 replace "RECURSIVE" with
"NON_RECURSIVE" twice.

[307:33-34 12.6.2.1p3] Replace "RECURSIVE" with "NON_RECURSIVE" and
insert "not" after "shall".

[309:11+7-11+20 Note 12.45] Delete Note 12.45.

[312:19 16.9.2.6p11] Replace "keyword RECURSIVE is" with "NON_RECURSIVE
and RECURSIVE keywords are"  Replace second "RECURSIVE" with
"NON_RECURSIVE".

[527:34 C.9.3] Delete "RECURSIVE".
