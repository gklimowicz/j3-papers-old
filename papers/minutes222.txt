** Motion 20-137 "UTI-015 - Autoallocate on internal write" [Bleikamp]
    (Bleikamp/Cohen) As amended. UC

** Motion 20-139 "UTI-002/3/4 - SPLIT intrinsic Motion" [Bleikamp]
    (Bleikamp/Cohen) no amendment needed for typos in discussion. UC

** Motion 20-141 "UTI-017 C_F_STRPOINTER" [Lionel] (Bleikamp/Lionel)
     As amended. UC  Steve has post

/Data:

** Motion 20-142 "Conditional expressions - specifications" [Cohen]
    (Cohen/Maddhipatla) There was a lively discussion, and a
    non-unanimous vote that ultimtely passed the paper.
       11: For   2: Against  1: Abstain
   The ones who voted against were asked if they could share their
   concerns for the record:
   Ondrej: Community thinks it's not helpful, cost doesn't outweigh
           the benefit
   Gary: Concerned about actual arguments being used on LValue, afraid
         of unexpected consequences

++ Discussion 20-143 "Conditional expressions - syntax" [Cohen] 
   This paper has multiple possible syntax schemes for conditional
   expressions, and the original intent was to conduct a straw
   poll.   Gary had an alternate syntax, so this was withdrawn for
   now to add Gary's version.

/HPC:

** Motion 20-145 "Response to UTI 010 - BOZ init for variable" [Long]
      (Long/Steidel) UC
