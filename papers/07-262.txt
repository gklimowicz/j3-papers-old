Discussion

The definition of the term "co-array" in 2.1.13 differs from that in
2.5.7 where it is defined as "a data entity that has nonzero co-rank".
While it is true that a co-array can be directly referenced or defined
by any image, this is not a defining property. A non-co-array data
entity with the target attribute can be referenced or defined by any
image if it is associated with a pointer component of a co-array.


Edit to J3/07-007r2

[10:39] In 2.1.13 co-array, replace the definition by
"data entity that has nonzero co-rank (2.5.7)".
