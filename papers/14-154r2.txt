NUMBER: F08/0107
TITLE: LOCK_TYPE, ultimate components, subcomponents, and coarrays
KEYWORD: LOCK_TYPE, ultimate components, subcomponents, coarrays
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

DISCUSSION:

Constraint C433 in subclause 4.5.2.1 reads:

C433 (R425) If EXTENDS appears and the type being defined has an
  ultimate component of type LOCK_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO
  FORTRAN ENV, its parent type shall have an ultimate component of type
  LOCK TYPE.

This was intended to prevent compromising protection of objects of type
LOCK_TYPE by using type extension and polymorphism.

According to subclause 1.3.33.4, an ultimate component is a

  component that is of intrinsic type, a pointer, or allocatable; or an
  ultimate component of a nonpointer nonallocatable component of derived
  type

The type LOCK_TYPE is not intrinsic.  Therefore, if a type has a
nonallocatable component of type LOCK_TYPE, it does not have an ultimate
component of type LOCK_TYPE.  Therefore, constraint C433 fails to
protect entities of type LOCK_TYPE.

Constraint C433 prohibits reasonable constructions, such as extending
the type LOCK_TYPE, or extending a type that has an allocatable
component that has a component of type LOCK_TYPE, because the parent
type does not have an ultimate component of type LOCK_TYPE.

Constraint C1302 in subclause 13.8.2.16 reads:

C1302 A named variable of type LOCK TYPE shall be a coarray. A named
  variable with a noncoarray subcomponent of type LOCK TYPE shall be a
  coarray.

This was intended to require that components of type LOCK_TYPE, at any
level of component selection, be coarrays.

According to subclause 1.3.33.3, a subcomponent is a

  <structure> direct component that is a subobject of a structure

According to subclause 1.3.33.1, a direct component is

  one of the components, or one of the direct components of a nonpointer
  nonallocatable component.

The definition of the term "subcomponent" does not include components of
allocatable components.  Therefore, because of the use of the term
"subcomponent," if an object has an allocatable component that in turn
has a component of type LOCK_TYPE, C1302 can fail to require a component
of type LOCK_TYPE to be a coarray.

QUESTIONS:

Assume type LOCK_TYPE from ISO_Fortran_Env is accessible.

1. Is the definition of type One below standard conforming?

type, extends(LOCK_TYPE) :: One
  type(lock_type), allocatable :: LOCK
end type One

2. Is the definition of type Four below standard conforming?

type :: Two
  type(lock_type), allocatable :: LOCK[:]
end type Two

type :: Three
  type(two), allocatable :: L
end type Three

Type, extends(Three) :: Four
  type(lock_type), allocatable :: LOCK[:]
end type Four

3. Is the definition of type Six below standard conforming?

type :: Five
end type Five

type, extends(Five) :: Six
  type(two), allocatable :: L
end type Six

4. Is the declaration of the variable X below standard conforming?

  type :: Seven
    type(lock_type) :: L
  end type Seven

  type :: Eight
    type(seven), allocatable :: C
  end type Eight

  type(eight) :: X

ANSWERS:

1. This was intended to be permitted.  An edit is provided to repair
   the constraint on adding a LOCK_TYPE component during type
   extension.

2. This was intended to be permitted.  An edit is provided to repair
   the constraint on adding a LOCK_TYPE component during type
   extension.

3. This was not intended to be permitted.  An edit is provided to
   repair the constraint on adding a LOCK_TYPE component during type
   extension.

4. This was not intended to be permitted.  An edit is provided to
   repair the constraint on declaring objects which have a potential
   subobject of type LOCK_TYPE.

EDITS:

After definition 1.3.33.2 "parent component", introduce a definition
  "1.3.35.2a
   potential subobject component
   nonpointer component, or potential subobject component of a
   nonpointer component (4.5.1)"

In C433 in subclause 4.5.2.1, replace "ultimate" with "potential
subobject" twice.  After "parent type" insert "shall be LOCK_TYPE
or".

Replace C642 in subclause 6.7.1.1:

"C642  If an <allocate-object> is a coarray, the declared type of
       <source-expr> shall not be C_PTR or C_FUNPTR.

"C642a If an <allocate-object> is a coarray, the declared type of
       <source-expr> in a SOURCE= specifier shall not be LOCK_TYPE
       (13.8.2.16), nor shall it have a potential subobject component of
       type LOCK_TYPE."

Replace Subclause 6.7.1.1, paragraph 4:

"If an <allocate-object> is a coarray and SOURCE= appears, the ALLOCATE
statement shall not have a <source-expr> with a dynamic type of
LOCK_TYPE, or with a component at any level of selection whose dynamic
type is LOCK_TYPE."

In C1302 in subclause 13.8.2.16, replace "with a noncoarray
subcomponent" with "of a type that has a noncoarray potential subobject
component".
