TITLE:    Procedure characteristics and unlimited polymorphic
KEYWORDS: Procedure, unlimited polymorphic
DEFECT TYPE: Error
STATUS:   Erratum

QUESTION:

Consider

    abstract interface
        function foo (x)
            class(*) x
            class(*), pointer :: foo
        end function
    end interface

    procedure (foo), pointer :: proc_ptr
    procedure (foo) proc_tgt

    proc_ptr => proc_tgt


According to the rules of procedure pointer assignment at [144:39-41],
proc_ptr and proc_tgt are required to have the same interface
characteristics.  However because an unlimited polymorphic entity is not
considered to have a declared type, the rules for characteristics of
dummy data objects [256:26-32] and characteristics of function
results [257:2-8] are not applicable. In addition, rules at [145:5-6]
require that proc_ptr and proc_tgt have the same function return type.
This also does not apply to unlimited polymorphic data.

Is the example intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, the example was intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is provided to clarify this.


EDITS to 04-007:

[145:5] After "the same type" insert " or both unlimited polymorphic"

[256:29] After "polymorphic," insert "whether it is unlimited polymorphic,"

[257:2-3]After "polymorphic," insert "whether it is unlimited polymorphic,"
