Subject:   Usage of name, identifier, local name, local identifier

concerns: J3/00-007R1

1. What is the difference of a name and an identifier?
Please define the term identifier in 2.5.1, add it to the heading of this
section and add it to the index and the glossary.

2. In 11.3.2 "local identifier" and "identifier" are used alternatively. Is
this difference in wording relevant in each case? If not I suggest to use
"local identifier" in each occurrence accept in (1) of the list of local
identifiers to improve readability.

3. In 11.3.2 In the list of local identifiers "(3) The name or defined
operator of the entity ..."
What is a "defined operator of an entity"? Why is the word "identifier" not
used here?

4. In note 4.41 the term "local name" is used. Why is the term "local
identifier" not used?
For consistency and readability I suggest to use the wording "local
identifier" here.
