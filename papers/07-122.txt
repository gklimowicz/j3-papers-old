Discussion

In J3/06-362, we removed the words "for a file that is open with a 
TEAM= specifier" from the CLOSE statement bullet item in the list of
image control statements (page 198 in J3/07-007). This was in response
to issue 88 (page 198 in J3/06-007r1) which pointed out that the 
qualification cannot be determined at compile time so a compiler would have
needed to treat all CLOSE statements as if they were image control 
statements.

Unfortunately, we overlooked the rule that no image control statement be
executed during the execution of the <block> of a CRITICAL construct 
(183:17-18 in J3/07-007). 

We now think it is better to accept that it cannot be determined at compile
time whether a CLOSE statement is an image control statement. From the
point of view of the user of the language it is more regular to have CLOSE
be an image control statement only if the unit is open for a team and the
execution of a <block> of a CRITICAL construct be a segment.


Edit to J3/07-007

[198:6] In the second paragraph of 8.5.1 Image control statements, add
to the CLOSE entry in the list of image control statements
"for a file that is open with a TEAM= specifier".
