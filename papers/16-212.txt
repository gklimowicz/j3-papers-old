We accept the editor's comments, including changing "coselector" to
"selector". Unfortunately, addressing them requires a significant number
of edits.


Edits to J3/16-007r1
--------------------

[3:6-7] In 1.3.6 associate name, after "ASSOCIATE," add "CHANGE TEAM,"
and delete ", or associated ... CHANGE TEAM construct".

[3:21-22] In 1.3.8.2 construct association, after "ASSOCIATE," add
"CHANGE TEAM," and delete ", or between ... CHANGE TEAM construct".

[175:2] In 8.1.3.3 Other attributes of associate names, para 1, line 1,
after "ASSOCIATE" add ", CHANGE TEAM,".

[175:11] In 8.1.3.3 Other attributes of associate names, after
sentence 2 of para 2, add a new sentence: "Within a CHANGE TEAM
construct, the associating entity is a coarray. Its corank and
cobounds are those specified in its <codimension-decl>."  and then
start a new paragraph (with "If the associating entity ...").

[177:1+] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, at the start, add subclause
title "8.1.5.1 Purpose and form of the CHANGE TEAM construct".

[177:2] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, after the first sentence, add
"It may associate coarrays with named coarrays during the execution of
its block. These named construct entities (16.4) are associating
entities (16.5.1.6). Their names are associate names."

[177:8,19,22,23] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, para 1, third BNF rule,
fifth constraint, and final two constraints, change "coselector-name"
to "selector-name".

[177:23+] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, after para 1, add subclause
title "8.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct".

[178:1-5] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, replace para 3 by

"Execution of an CHANGE TEAM construct causes evaluation of every
expression within every <codimension-decl>, followed by execution of its
block. Each <coarray-name> in a <codimension-decl> is an associate name.
During execution of that block each associate name identifies a coarray
which is associated (16.5.1.6) with the corresponding selector.
The associating coarray assumes the declared type and type parameters of
the selector. If and only if the selector is polymorphic, the
associating coarray is polymorphic. The associating coarray shall be
established when the CHANGE TEAM statement begins execution.

The other attributes of the associating entity are described in 8.1.3.3.

It is permissible to branch to an <end-change-team-stmt> only from within
its CHANGE TEAM construct."

[178:5+] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, para 3, delete UTI 19.

[507:9] In 16.4 Statement and construct entities, para 10, change
"8.1.5" to "8.1.5.1".

[510:9] In 16.5.1.6 Construct association, para 1, final sentence, change
"coselector" to "selector".

[522:36] In 16.6.7 Variable definition context, para 1, item(12), change
"coselector" to "selector".
