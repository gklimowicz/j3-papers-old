2008 Fees for Participation on INCITS Technical Committees and Task

________________________________


Dear INCITS Technical Committee and Task Group Members,

The InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards
(INCITS) serves in two major roles:

*	SDO - INCITS provides a low cost, ANSI accredited process for
developing US National Standards.=20

*	TAG - As the US TAG to ISO/IEC JTC 1, most of the JTC 1
Subcommittees and Working Groups, and ISO/TC 211, INCITS represents US
interests in ISO and ISO/IEC JTC 1 activities.=20

INCITS members participate in the development of standards and exercise
US TAG responsibilities including the ability to influence global ICT
standards decisions through their participation on US delegations to
international meetings. =20

INCITS Secretariat services are provided by employees of the Information
Technology Industry Council (ITI). The INCITS Secretariat supports the
progression of standards through the domestic SDO process through the
establishment, maintenance and oversight of the program's ANSI
accredited procedures and processes.   In response to the INCITS
community's interest in getting our standards into the hands of the
broadest base possible, most of the INCITS standards are available in
electronic format for $30.=20

The Secretariat serves as the US TAG Administrator in monitoring and
distributing international issues and documents to ensure timely US
responses. INCITS serves as the US Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for
ISO/IEC JTC 1, 2 Special Working Groups of ISO/IEC JTC 1, 14
Subcommittees of ISO/IEC JTC 1, 61 Working Groups associated with those
SCs, one ISO TC and 5 Working Groups in ISO.  INCITS provides the
financial support for the US-held international Secretariats
administered by ANSI (JTC 1, JTC 1/SC 22 and JTC 1 Special Working Group
on Directives) and INCITS/ITI (JTC 1 Special Working Group on
Accessibility). =20

The INCITS program is funded largely by participation fees.  Executive
Board dues and fees were increased in 2003 with the decision to merge
INCITS with the JTC 1 TAG.  Technical Committee and Task Group fees have
remain unchanged since 2001.

During the course of the 2006 INCITS strategic review, it was
acknowledged that the existing IT infrastructure was outdated and no
longer met the needs of the INCITS community.  Comments from
participants at the annual TC Officers' Symposiums have echoed these
concerns. =20

We have reached a point where we must raise TC and TG service fees to
fund the INCITS Secretariat services, meet our commitments to US
participation and leadership in the international standards community by
funding the US-held international Secretariats administered by ANSI and
INCITS/ITI, and build the modern IT infrastructure necessary to provide
the INCITS members with the services they need and deserve.   A
demonstration of an IT infrastructure solution will be presented during
the July 16-17, 2007 INCITS TC Officers' Symposium.

The Executive Board has agreed that the 2008 budget should anticipate a
significant IT infrastructure investment and that revenue must be
increased to cover the anticipated expense.  At the April 2007 INCITS
Executive Board meeting, the following new fee structure was approved
for 2008:

2008 Fee Structure (by organization)=20

*	TC/TG Service Fees=20

	*	$1,200 - TC or 1st TG if not member of TC=20
	*	$ 400 - Subsequent TG=20
	*	Alternates=20

		*	Eliminate fee for additional alternates=20
		*	No limit to number of alternates=20

Although the INCITS Secretariat and Executive Board regret this
necessary fee increase, we are confident that INCITS remains the most
cost effective forum for developing domestic standards and influencing
ISO/IEC JTC 1.

Best regards,


Jennifer Garner
Director, INCITS Standards Programs
