To:        J3
From:      Aleksandar Donev (JOR)
Subject:   US Public Comments to be Considered for Future Revision
Reference: US Public Comments #1-#21
**************************************************

At meeting 164 J3 recommended that some of the features suggested
during Public Comment be considered for the next revision.

____________________________________________________

JOR recommends the following items be considered further:

1. Adding a C_SIZEOF or SIZEOF intrinsic
(Suggested in Public Comment #6 by J. Vezina and others)
2. Add unsigned integer support
(Suggested in Public Comment #6 by J. Vezina and others)
3. Add FIRSTLOC and LASTLOC array functions
(Suggested in Public Comment #6 by J. Vezina)
Note also that we could extend MAXLOC and MINLOC to do this, even though this
would duplicate the MASK twice.
4. Add a return integer for program
(Suggested by T. Plessel in Public Comment #1)
5. Multiple non-zero rank part refs
(Suggested by A. Donev in Comment #5 and also 03-253)
6. Add an s= argument to EPSILON, RRSPACING and SPACING to indicate the
direction of the epsilon.
(Suggested by D. Nagle in Comment #21)
7. Make the construct name local to the construct (not global)
(Suggested by D. Nagle in Comment #21 and in 03-258)
8. Allow BOZs as arguments for CHAR intrinsic
(Suggested by D. Nagle in Comment #21)

____________________________________________________

JOR recommends that the following comments not be considered any further:

1. Add a CONVERSION EXPLICIT statement to forbid implicit conversions
(Suggested in Public Comment #6 by J. Vezina)
2. Add Design by Contract to Fortran
(Suggested by T. Plessel in Public Comment #1)
3. Allow to rename the parent component of extended types
(Suggested by A. Donev in Comment #7)
4. Allow any composite English word to be split
(Suggested by D. Nagle in Comment #21)
5. Add intrinsics to convert from array indices to offset and vice versa
(Suggested by D. Nagle in Comment #21)
6. Allow BOZs as arguments for LOGICAL intrinsic
(Suggested by D. Nagle in Comment #21)
