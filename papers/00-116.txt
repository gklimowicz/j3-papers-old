Subject: Issues 233, 234 and 235

1. Issue 233
------------

Issue 233 asks whether defined operators should be IMPORT-able.
Since this adds complexity (at least to the syntax) and no functionality,
we answer no.

2. Issue 234
------------

Issue 234 asks whether the ASYNCHRONOUS (or VOLATILE) attribute can be
respecified for an entity imported into an interface body.

It is difficult to see what this could possibly achieve.
An interface body cannot contain any i/o statements, making the asynchronous
attribute (for a host entity, not a dummy argument) irrelevant.

Similarly, specifying the VOLATILE attribute for a host entity from an
interface block cannot do anything either.

Note that these cases are not similar to the usual "host association" cases,
because the actual procedure does not have access to anything from the
host of the interface body.

The choice is between
 (a) allow the user to specify ASYNCHRONOUS/VOLATILE on an IMPORTed
variable,
     [for consistency, even though it is futile and potentially confusing]
or
 (b) disallow the user from so specifying (as the IMPORT statement now
stands)

Sv?

Furthermore, issue 234 notes that Note 14.11 which mentions ASYNCHRONOUS
does
not mention VOLATILE.

3. Issue 235
------------

Issue 235 notes that Note 14.12 is no longer correct.  I concur.

4. Edits to 00-007
------------------

These edits assume we will disallow the user from specifying ASYNCHRONOUS
and
VOLATILE for an IMPORTed variable.

[246:39-46] Delete J3 note 233.

[247:30-36] Delete J3 note 234.

[350:2-4] Replace "ASYNCHRONOUS" by "ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE" thrice.
{Mention VOLATILE as being peculiar just like ASYNCHRONOUS.}

[350:3] Change "otherwise accessible via host association"
        to "accessible via host association other than by an IMPORT
statement"
{Make the note less contradictory.}

[350:12-13] Replace with
"An interface body accesses only those entities named in IMPORT statements
by
 host association."
{Replace note 14.12 which had become incorrect.}

[350:14-16] Delete J3 note 235.
