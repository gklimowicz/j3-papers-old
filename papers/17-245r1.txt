Subject:   Comment GB062, regarding result characteristics

1. Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[353:6] General (under Specifications of the Standard Intrinsic
        Procedures) 16.09.1 Para 2
The third sentence of the paragraph, "The result characteristics are
sometimes specified in terms of the characteristics of dummy
arguments." is not helpful because the detailed specifications are
for the actual arguments, see the second sentence.


2. Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There was a lively discussion both in subgroup and in plenary, and
a solution was agreed to by a majority of members present at plenary.

3. Edit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[353:6] General (under Specifications of the Standard Intrinsic
        Procedures) 16.09.1 Para 2
In the third sentence of the paragraph, replace the word "dummy"
with the word "the", making the sentence read:

"The result characteristics are sometimes specified in terms
 of the characteristics of the arguments."

{Retains the message that the result can depend on the arguments,
 yet removes the contentious reference to a "dummy" argument }
