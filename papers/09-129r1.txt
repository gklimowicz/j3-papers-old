Subject: Spurious defined terms in clause 11.
Date: 2009 February 09

1. Introduction
---------------

The system for "defining" terms we used in previous versions of the
standard is not in accordance with the ISO guidelines, so we need to stop
using it.  We have already introduced the ISO-compliant defined terms
subclause, and moved/copied many definitions into it.  However, quite a lot
have not been revised.  These should either
  - be turned into normal text ("untermified")
or
  - become proper defined terms.

This paper deals with the terms in clause 11.


2. Terms and what to do with them
---------------------------------

 - intrinsic module: Not needed, we already have "intrinsic";
   = untermify, do not index.

 - nonintrinsic module: Ditto;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - USE statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - USE statement (twice!): Huh?
   = index the second one, not the first.
   Can't we reword this to avoid saying what a USE statement does twice?

 - use associated: Not needed, we already have "use association";
   = untermify, index as "use association".

 - parent: Stealing Already-In-Use Terms Is Rude, We Already Have "host";
   = use "host", or use "parent scope", or use "parent program unit";
     subgroup agreed "host" was good.

 - child: Stealing Already-In-Use Terms Is Rude, And It's Unnecessary;
   = delete definition and reword.

 - ancestor: Stealing Already-In-Use Terms Is Rude;
   = reword ("ancestor program unit" will do), simplify, untermify.

 - submodule identifier: Only Used Once;
   = untermify, index as definition, make sure the use is indexed.

[10:11(1.3.62p1)] "of the parent of"->"extended by".

[273:20(11.2.1p1)] Unembolden "intrinsic module", do not index.

[273:20(11.2.1p1)] Unembolden "nonintrinsic module", do not index.

[274:21(11.2.2p1)] Unembolden "USE statement", do not index.

[275:1(11.2.2p2)] Unembolden "USE statement", index as statement.

[275:3-4(11.2.2p2)] Unembolden "use associated",
                    index as "use association".

[277:4(11.2.3p1)] "<<parent>>"->"host", and "parent"->"host".
{Unembolden and replace term.}

[277:4-6(11.2.3p1)] Replace three sentences "A submodule ... children."
  with the single sentence
    "A module or submodule is an ancestor program unit of all of its
     descendants, which are its submodules and their descendants."
  and index as definitions "ancestor program unit" and "descendant".
{Simplify, reduce number of unnecessary terms.}

[277:6(11.2.3p1)] Unembolden "submodule identifier", index as definition.

[277:8(11.2.3p2)] Delete paragraph.
{It is now vacuous - of course the host scoping unit is accessed by host
 association.}
