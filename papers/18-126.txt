Introduction
------------
In formatted output of strings, it is common to want to remove leading
and trailing blanks from the string before output. This results in
I/O lists being cluttered with multiple occurences of
TRIM(ADJUSTL(value)).

Currently, an A edit descriptor with a width of zero is not
permitted (C1306). This paper proposes to define A0 as indicating
that leading and trailing blanks shall be removed from the string
before output. A0 is not to be permitted on input.

In the case of G0, the standard currently states "follow the rules
for the A edit descriptor with no field width." Changing this to
be A0 would be an incompatibility with Fortran 2018, but it is
probably a behavior change most users would find desirable.

Straw vote: Should G0 change incompatibly to the new A0 behavior
on output? Yes/No
