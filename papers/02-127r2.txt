Subject:  Chapter 13, minor technical changes

1)          Page 278  NOTE 13.4 says
"Intrinsic procedures that assign values to arguments of type character
do so in accordance with the rules of intrinsic assignment (7.5.1.4)."

I don't think this is deducible from the surrounding text and I couldn't
find it elsewhere.

Proposal 1) Delete the phrase "NOTE 13.4" and make it's contents
normative text.

Proposal 2) Change "procedures" to "subroutines".   No need to be
general here; only subroutines change their arguments.

2)          The model description on 279:7-8 assumes a base two
representation that isn't actually required.

Proposal  279:7-8  Change to
"In particular, whereas the models are identical for wz_1 = 0, s = +1,
and r=2, they do not correspond for other cases and the interpretation
of bits in such objects is processor dependent.
WITHDRAWN:  This will be covered by Interp F90/207

3)          Page 301:29-31  EXTENDS_TYPE_OF result value.  I found the
first sentence hard to parse; partly because it's always unclear in
English how "and" and "or" interact in a sequence and partly because
the first and second phrase are not parallel (I think they are trying
to describe the same things).

Proposal  301 29-31  change to
Result Value. If MOLD is unlimited polymorphic and is either a disassociated
                                                   ^^^^^^^^
pointer or an unallocated allocatable, the result is true; otherwise
           ^^                                              ^^^^^^^^^
if A is unlimited polymorphic and is either a disassociated pointer or an
                                     ^^^^^^
unallocated allocatable,...
