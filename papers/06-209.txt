Subject: Pending interps for integration

References: J3/06-006ar2

The following is a selection of interps that have not yet been 
processed or failed some stage of the ballot. I believe these
ought to be processed and corrections be made to the Fortran
2008 draft. My focus has been on Interop papers, although I spotted
a few more.

Not processed yet:

INTEROP:
_________________________
NUMBER: F03/0053
TITLE: The BIND attribute for C_PTR and C_FUNPTR
EDITS:

Page and line numbers refer to 04-007.

[397:3] Subclause 15.2.2. At the end of the first paragraph add
"Each has the BIND attribute but is not interoperable with any C
struct type."
_________________________
NUMBER: F03/0073
TITLE: C interop of dummy procedures
EDITS:

In item (5) in the list in section 15.2.6, replace "any dummy argument
without the VALUE attribute" with "any dummy argument that is not a
procedure and does not have the VALUE attribute" and replace "pointer
type" with "object pointer type".

and add a new item (5+) to the list:

(5+) any dummy procedure argument corresponds to a formal parameter of
the prototype that is of function pointer type, and the dummy procedure
is interoperable with a function of the referenced type of the formal
parameter;

_________________________
NUMBER: F03/0074
TITLE: Type mismatch for C character arguments

EDITS:

In the second and 3rd paras of 12.4.1.2, replace "of type default
character" with "of type default character, of type character with the C
character kind (15.1),"

_________________________
NUMBER: F03/0075
TITLE: C interop of derived types with array components

EDITS:

Append to the end of C1505 a new sentence:

"If the component is an array, the corresponding C component shall
 be an array and the shapes of the two arrays shall be as prescribed
 in 15.2.5."

_________________________
NUMBER: F03/0076
TITLE: Scope of Fortran names of procedures with binding labels

EDITS: ???
_________________________

OTHER:

_________________________
NUMBER: F03/0077
TITLE: LBOUND of array structure component
KEYWORDS: LBOUND, lower bounds, bounds, structure component, array
          sections

EDITS: TBD

_________________________
NUMBER: F03/0082
TITLE: VALUE in place of INTENT for pure procedure dummy arguments
EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[286:12] at the end of C1266, add "or the VALUE attribute".

[286:13-14] Replace C1277:

  C1267 Within the <specification-part> of a pure subroutine
        subprogram, for each non-pointer dummy data object,
        either its intent shall be explicitly specified or it
        shall have the VALUE attribute.

Failed some ballot:
