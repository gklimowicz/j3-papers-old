Subject: Non-sibling access masquerading as sibling access
Date: 2019-October-14


1. Introduction

Paper 19-180 contains three purported interpretation requests glommed into
a single paper. This paper discusses the second of them.


2. The alleged problem

From 19-180:
    "Section 9.6, paragraph 3 explains the semantics of image selectors
     that specify TEAM=, TEAM_NUMBER=, or that specify neither.  There are
     several problems with this paragraph.
...
    "The TEAM_NUMBER= specifier in an image selector may specify a value
     of -1 if and only if the current team is the initial team. This is
     different than the behavior of the TEAM_NUMBER arguments of the
     IMAGE_INDEX and NUM_IMAGES intrinsics which allow -1 to indicate the
     initial team, no matter what the current team is."


3. Response from /INTERP

Firstly, it is unclear why the intrinsic functions in question should have
any bearing on this facility.  TEAM_NUMBER is, as noted, not a specifier in
an intrinsic function reference but an argument, and intrinsic functions
frequently have special cases.

Secondly, and more importantly, TEAM_NUMBER= in an image selector is for
accessing sibling teams. It would be quite surprising for an image selector
written with TEAM_NUMBER= to access an ancestor team instead of a sibling
team. Accessing ancestor teams is the purpose of the TEAM= specifier.

Thirdly, the requirements on TEAM_NUMBER= for coarray establishment make
it crystal clear that the access cannot be to an ancestor team but to a
sibling team. Permitting such accesswould introduce an inconsistency.

Therefore /INTERP concludes that this looks more like a new feature
request, and one that is not obviously desirable.

Therefore /INTERP politely declines to accept this request at this time.

Instead, /HPC is requested to review its history to see whether this
alleged missing functionality was both omitted by accident and is so
highly desirable that we need to add it to the standard right now.

If the conclusion of /HPC is that this was an accidental omission that
warrants immediate correction rather than being processed as a new feature
request, /INTERP will accept it and process it accordingly.


4. Comment

It would appear that the arbitrary decision to number the initial team
with the special value "-1" has prompted some unusual and interesting
design decisions and questions. In hindsight, perhaps "+1" might have
been better (this would have removed the possibility of such strange and
unusual designs and interpretations).
