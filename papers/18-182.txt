Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, the GB comment 27
reads:

(Referencing page 269, 13.4 Interaction between input/output list
and format, paragraph 5)

Edit descriptor EX has inadvertently been omitted from the list
of descriptors which relate to a real variable.

with the suggested edit:

After "ES," insert "EX,"

Discussion
----------

We agree.



Edit to N2146
-------------

In 13.4 Interaction between input/output list and format,
the fifth paragraph (immediately following Note 13.5), now reads:

"To each data edit descriptor interpreted in a format specification,
there corresponds one effective item specified by the input/output list
(12.6.3), except that an input/output list item of type complex
requires the interpretation of two F, E, EN, ES, D, or G edit
descriptors.  For each control edit descriptor or character edit
descriptor, there is no corresponding item specified by the
input/output list, and format control communicates information
directly with the record."

In the second clause of the first sentence, after "ES,"
add "EX,"

so the resulting paragraph reads:

"To each data edit descriptor interpreted in a format specification,
there corresponds one effective item specified by the input/output list
(12.6.3), except that an input/output list item of type complex
requires the interpretation of two F, E, EN, ES, EX, D, or G edit
descriptors.  For each control edit descriptor or character edit
descriptor, there is no corresponding item specified by the
input/output list, and format control communicates information
directly with the record."

{correctly state that complex might correspond
to two EX edit descriptors}
