Subject:  Interpretation: attributes allowed for dummy arguments in
          defined assignments

NUMBER:   F03/
TITLE:    attributes allowed for dummy arguments in defined assignments

KEYWORDS: defined assignment, dummy argument, attributes

DEFECT TYPE: Error
STATUS:   Erratum

DISCUSSION
It seems the standard is quite loose in allowing various attributes
declared for the dummy arguments used in a defined assignment (7.4.1.4).
In particular, attributes such as POINTER and ALLOCATABLE can be
declared for dummy arguments in the defined assignment.  However the
interpretations on their declarations need to be clarified.


Consider the follow subroutines (assuming a derived type DT already
defined)

    1. POINTER/ALLOCATABLE on the second dummy argument

    interface ASSIGNMENT (=)
    subroutine defAssgn1 (dt1, dt2)
        type(DT), intent(out) :: dt1
        type(DT), POINTER, intent(in) :: dt2
    end subroutine
    end interface


    In 12.3.2.1.2 [263:10-12], the standard says the following
    "A defined assignment is treated as a reference to the subroutine,
     with the left-hand side as the first argument and the right-hand
     side enclosed in parentheses as the second argument."

    This statement seems to prohibit the use of subroutine defAssgn1 for
    defined assignment since a pointer enclosed in parentheses refers
    to its associated target not the pointer itself, as indicated by
    rules in 7.1.4.1 [123:39-124:3].


    2. POINTER/ALLOCATABLE on the first dummy argument

    interface ASSIGNMENT (=)
    subroutine defAssgn2 (dt1, dt2)
        type(DT), POINTER, intent(out) :: dt1
        type(DT), intent(in) :: dt2
    end subroutine
    end interface

    There are no rules in the standard disallow this declaration. However
    the use of POINTER/ALLOCATABLE attributes on the first dummy argument
    is very doubtful.  Since POINTER/ALLOCATABLE attributes don't
    disambiguate generic declarations(16.2.3), their use will prevent the
    normal declarations of defined assignments, wherein dt1 is declared
    without POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attribute.

QUESTIONS:
    1.  Are POINTER and ALLOCATABLE attributes allowed for the second
        dummy argument in defined assignment?

    2.  Are POINTER and ALLOCATABLE attributes allowed for the first
        dummy argument in defined assignment?

ANSWER:
    No to both questions. The standard does not intend to allow POINTER or
    ALLOCATABLE attribute for either dummy argument.  An edit is supplied
    to correct this oversight.

EDITS:
    [263:6] In 12.3.2.1.2 "Defined assignments", replace the second
    sentence.

    "Each argument shall be nonoptional."

    with

    "Each argument shall not have OPTIONAL, POINTER or ALLOCATABLE
     attribute."
