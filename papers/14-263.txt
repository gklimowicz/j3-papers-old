TITLE: SPACING intrinsic
KEYWORDS:
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program

  Program test_spacing
    Real :: x, y, tiny_spacing, z
    x = Tiny(x)
    y  = Nearest(x,1.0)
    tiny_spacing = y - x
    If (tiny_spacing>0) Then
      ! Probably IEEE arithmetic with subnormals:
      ! the spacing y - x is representable.
    Else
      ! Probably no subnormals, so y - z is not representable.
      tiny_spacing = Tiny(x)
    End If
    z = Spacing(x)
    If (z/=tiny_spacing) Then
      Print *,'FAIL'
    Else
      Print *,'ok'
    End If
  End Program

Furthermore let us assume that the processor supports IEEE arithmetic
with subnormals, and that default REAL is IEEE single precision.

According to Fortran 95, the result for SPACING is:
  "If X is not zero, the result has the value b**(e-p), where b, e,
   and p are as defined in 13.7.1 for the model representation of X,
   provided this result is within range."
therefore the program is expected to print the value "ok".

However, according to Fortran 2008, the result for SPACING is:
  "If X does not have the value zero ..., the result has the value
   b**max(e-p,emin-1), where ..."
Unsurprisingly, e-p is not equal to max(e-p,emin-1) for smallish
numbers, and therefore the program would be expected to print the
value "FAIL".  However, there is no such incompatibility with Fortran
90/95 listed in clause 1, therefore the standard contradicts itself.
(The value specified in Fortran 2008 also contradicts the Description
of the function which says "Spacing of model numbers (13.4)", since
it does not even attempt to return that value.)

Is the new specification a deliberate incompatibility or a mistake?

DISCUSSION:

The description of SPACING was changed in Fortran 2003 by paper
01-361r2 "Comments on Section 13", which contains no justification for
this technical change and indeed does not even mention it is a
technical change - there is just the bare edit (buried in a huge list
of bare edits) with no indication as to why.  This would seem to
indicate that the technical change is an inadvertant error (presumably
the paper simply forgot about subnormal numbers and assumed the new
formula gave the same result as the old one).

ANSWER:

The new wording of SPACING inadvertantly changed the return values
when IEEE subnormal values were available.  An edit is provided to
correct this mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[389:4-5] 13.7.157 SPACING (X), p5 Result Value,
          Change "max(e-p,emin-1)" to "e-p",
          After "that of X" insert
            ", provided this result is representable; otherwise the
             result is the same as that of TINY (X).",
          Change "; if there are two such values" to
          "If there are two extended model values equally near to X,".

This makes the whole paragraph read:

 If X does not have the value zero and is not an IEEE infinity or NaN,
 the result has the value b**(e-p), where b, e, and p are as defined
 in 13.4 for the value nearest to X in the model for real values whose
 kind type parameter is that of X, provided this result is
 representable; otherwise the result is the same as that of TINY (X).
 If there are two extended model values equally near to X, the value
 of greater absolute value is taken.  If X has the value zero, the
 result is the same as that of TINY (X).  If X is an IEEE infinity,
 the result is an IEEE NaN.  If X is an IEEE NaN, the result is that
 NaN."

where "b**(e-p)" represents the typesetting of $b^{e-p}$.
