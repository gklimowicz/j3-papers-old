At Delft (N1637), it was decided to add a c_sizeof()
intrinsic to f08.  This paper attempts to provide edits.

The original paper is 04-344r1.

Edits:

[125:41+] Add list item

"(4++) the intrinsic module function C_SIZEOF,"

[395:31+++] (after the Note) Add section

"15.1.2.6 C_SIZEOF (X)

*Description.*  Returns the size, as defined
                by the C sizeof operator (Section
                6.5.3.4 of the C International Standard),
                of the argument X.

*Class.*  Inquiry function.

*Arguments.*

X              X shall have interoperable type and type
               parameters. It may be a scalar or an array
               that is not assumed-size.

*Result Characteristics.*  Integer scalar
                           of kind C_SIZE_T (15.2.1).

*Result Value.*  The result value is the size of X
                 as defined by the sizeof operator (Section
                 6.5.3.4 of the C International Standard)
                 of the companion C processor.  If
                 the companion processor is not a C processor,
                 the result value is processor dependent."
