Subject: Interp on nonadvancing I/O and DO CONCURRENT

NUMBER: F08/0144
TITLE: Is nonadvancing I/O allowed during execution of DO CONCURRENT?
KEYWORDS: nonadvancing I/O, DO CONCURRENT
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

  program P
    integer :: I
    do concurrent ( I = 1:10 )
      write ( *, *, advance='NO' ) i
    end do
    write ( *, * )
  end program P

Q1. Is this conforming and if so, what output is produced?

  program Q
    integer :: I
    logical :: L(10) = .FALSE.
    real :: X(10) = 0
    do concurrent ( I = 1:10 )
      if ( mod(i,2) == 0 ) then
        read ( *, '(g15.6)', advance='no' ) x(i)
      else
        read ( *, '(l3)', advance='no' ) l(i)
      end if
    end do
    print *,x,l
  end program

Q2. Is this conforming and what kind of output would be expected?

ANSWER:

No, these programs are not conforming as no interpretation is
established for them.

OPTION ONE:
It was intended that nonadvancing input/output on a single unit not be
permitted during more than one iteration of a DO CONCURRENT construct.

An edit is provided to address this oversight.

OPTION TWO:
It was intended that nonadvancing input/output not be permitted within
a DO CONCURRENT construct.

An edit is provided to address this oversight.
END OPTIONS

EDITS ONE:

[10-007r1:178:18+ at the end of the list in 8.1.6.7p1] insert a list
item:

"  o If a nonadvancing input/output statement is executed during one
     iteration, an input/output statement that accesses the same unit
     shall not be executed during a different iteration.
"

EDITS TWO:

[10-007r1:178:18+ at the end of the list in 8.1.6.7p1] insert a list
item:

"  o A DO CONCURRENT construct shall not contain an input/output
     statement that has an ADVANCING= specifier."
