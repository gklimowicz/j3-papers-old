Subject:  Unresolved Issue 171

Unresolved issue 171, p. 397, references problems with paper 99-117r2
regarding glossary entries.

99-117r2 introduces 20 terms from the C and IEEE 754 standards. Many
of these terms were not incorporated into the glossary, nor do they
need to be.

Of the terms referenced in 99-117r2, the following have been
incorporated into the glossary:

companion processor
external linkage
flexible array member
linked
NaN
prototype
rounding mode
struct
unsigned
void

The capitalization of the terms above in 01-007R1 is correct. Subgroup
does not believe any new terms need to be added.

The term 'flexible array member' is not referenced in the standard. Subgroup
believes it should be deleted from the Glossary.

[402:5-6] Delete glossary entry for flexible array member.
