Subject: Spurious defined terms in clause 16.
Date: 2009 February 05

1. Introduction
---------------

The system for "defining" terms we used in previous versions of the
standard is not in accordance with the ISO guidelines, so we need to stop
using it.  We have already introduced the ISO-compliant defined terms
subclause, and moved/copied many definitions into it.  However, quite a lot
have not been revised.  These should either
  - be turned into normal text ("untermified")
or
  - become proper defined terms.

This paper deals with the terms in clause 16.


2. Terms and what to do with them
---------------------------------

 - scope: Normal Usage, Not a Proper Definition;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - global identifier: Normal Usage, Only A Partial Definition;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - local identifier: Ditto;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - statement entity: Special Term, Not Really A Definition;
   = termify, index not as definition.
   We made "construct entity" a special term so we have to do this too.

 - name association: Special Term;
   = termify, index as definition.

 - use association: Already A Term, Not Yet Hyperlinked;
   = fix font, index as definition, hyperlink.

 - pointer association status: Variant Of "pointer association";
   = untermify, index as definition, hyperlink "pointer association".

 - storage association: Already A Term, Not Yet Hyperlinked;
   = fix font, index as definition, hyperlink.

 - storage sequence: Already A Term, Not Yet Hyperlinked;
   = fix font, index as definition, hyperlink.

 - size of a storage sequence: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - storage associated: Variation Of "storage association";
   = untermify, do not index.

 - totally associated: Common Usage;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - partially associated: Common Usage;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - associating entity: Special Term;
   = termify, index as definition.

 - pre-existing entity: Common Usage;
   = untermify, index as definition.

[] Define terms (some as subterms):
  "\term{associating entity}
   in a dynamically-established association, the entity that did not exist
   prior to the establishment of the association
   (\ref{D16:Establishing associations})

   \subtermm{name}{association}
   \termii{argument}{association},
   \termii{construct}{association},
   \termii{host}{association},
   \termii{linkage}{association}, or
   \termii{use}{association}
   (\ref{D16:Name association})

   \subterm{linkage}{association}
   association between a variable or common block with \theattr{BIND} and
   a C global variable
   (\ref{D15:Interoperation with C global variables},
   \ref{D16:Linkage association})

   \term{statement entity}
   entity whose identifier has a scope of a statement or part of a
   statement (\ref{D16:Identifiers and entities},
   \ref{D16: Statement and construct entities})".

[throughout] Hyperlink the above as appropriate.
             Also hyperlink "use association".
             Also hyperlink "pointer association".
             Also hyperlink "storage association".
             Also hyperlink "storage sequence".
