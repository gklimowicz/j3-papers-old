Subject: The new COMPLEX intrinsic.
Date: 2008 August 12

Rationale:

There is a need expressed for an intrinsic function that constructs
a complex number from two real numbers with the equal kind type
parameters yielding a result value having the same kind type parameter.

"COMPLEX      (X, Y)    E   Conversion to complex type with the same
                            kind type parameter as X and Y."

"13.7.yy <<COMPLEX(X, Y)>>

 <<Description.>>  Conversion to complex type.

 <<Class.>>  Elemental function.

 <<Arguments.>>  X and Y are of type real with the same kind type
                 parameters.

 <<Result Characteristics.>>  The result is of type complex with the
                              same kind type parameter as X and Y.

 <<Result value.>>  The result value is the complex number with
                    real part X and imaginary part Y.

 <<Example.>>  COMPLEX(A, B) is (3.0, 4.5) if A is 3.0 and B is 4.5."
