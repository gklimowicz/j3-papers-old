Ballot Comments
--------------

The two comments, DE046 and GB047, are very similar.  The comments say
that, in order to be useful inside a CHANGE TEAM construct, UCOBOUND
must return the final upper cobound relevant for the current team, and
not to the team in which it was established.

Comment DE046 also says that this technical change must be mentioned
in the Introduction.


Discussion
----------

This change was originally proposed in 17-206, but rejected during the
HPC subgroup discussions on performance grounds.

The change only impacts the value returned for the last upper cobound,
since all other cobounds are preserved across the execution of a
CHANGE team statement (see Note 11.7).

The use of NUM_IMAGES() in the Example is already consistent with
making the change.

Given that the current specification will negatively impact the
usability, we accept the suggested technical change.


Edit to N2146
-------------

Introduction, para 2, page xx, heading "Changes to features previously
described by ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015:" add text at the end of the
bullet:

"The intrinsic function UCOBOUND produces a final upper cobound that
is always relative to the current team."


In subclause 16.9.197 UCOBOUND (COARRAY [, DIM, KIND]) para 5 Result
value, 1st sentence, replace

"team current when COARRAY was established"

with

"current team"

so that the complete sentence reads:

"The final upper cobound is the final cosubscript in the cosubscript
list for the coarray that selects the image whose index is equal to
the number of images in the current team."
