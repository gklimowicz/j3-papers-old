A. Introduction
---------------

NOTE 7.28 reads
	For example, the processor may choose to evaluate the expression
		I > J
	where I and J are integer variables, as
		J - I < 0

This is an old, old note from the days when hardware for subtractions
and comparisons was rather different.  Even though the NOTE is
non-normative, it is rather bad advice to give now, considering that
it can introduce spurious overflows, e.g.
		J =  1073741824
		I = -1073741824
gets .FALSE. and .TRUE. on some processors, respectively, for the
supposedly equivalent expressions.

According to the normative text, that means
that I > J and J - I < 0 are not normally relationally equivalent.

(2) Add the phrase "if it is known that no spurious overflows
	would be thereby introduced."
    at the end of NOTE 7.28 at [07-007r1:150].
