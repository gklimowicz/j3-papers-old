1. Edits accepted (with modifications)
--------

[217:29 12.2.2p1 Formatted record]
Editor's choice:  Replace "However, it may depend" with "However,
the length may depend", join this sentence with the previous one using
a semicolon, or merge this sentence with the following one ("The length
may also be zero.")
(The "it" referenced in "it may depend" is ambiguous, since the most
recent "it" was the record itself.)

[220:33+2 NOTE 12.8 Stream access]
Replace "Because the record" with "If the record".  Delete "the" from
"the record markers" .
(Because the file structure isn't necessarily determined by
record markers in the file, such as on the VMS OS.)

[221:24-25 12.3.4.2p2 Advancing and nonadvancing input/output]
Delete the sentence "It is also possible ... their lengths."
{because this does not any longer depend upon nonadvancing input}.

[223:4 12.4p2(1) Internal files]
After "variable of default, ASCII, or ISO 10646 character" insert "kind".

[227:21 C1203 OPEN statememt] Before "No specifier" insert "(R1204)"
(because there's only one BNF rule for <connect-spec> and
<connect-spec-list> only appears in R1204)

[230:22+ 12.5.6.18p3+ STATUS= specifier in the OPEN statement]
Move NOTE 12.21 to be after 12.5.6.18p3.
(More appropriate placement.)

[239:3-4 12.6.4.1p1 Data transfer sequence of operations]
Replace "for a file that does not exist" with "on a unit connected to
a file that does not exist"
(This is a property of the connection.)

[239:7 12.6.4.1p2(1) Data transfer sequence of operations]
After "Determine the direction of data transfer" add and link
"(12.6.4.2)" (Direction of data transfer)

[239:8 12.6.4.1p2(2) Data transfer sequence of operations]
After "Identify the unit" add and link "(12.6.4.3)" (Identifying
the unit)

[239:25 12.6.4.1p3(1) Data transfer sequence of operations]
After "Determine the direction of data transfer" add and link
"(12.6.4.2)" (Direction of data transfer)

[239:26 12.6.4.1p3(2) Data transfer sequence of operations]
After "Identify the unit" add and link "(12.6.4.3)" (Identifying
the unit)

[244:9 12.6.4.8.3p1 Defined input/output procedures]
Replace "The user need not" with "The program need not"
{because the program might have been produced by other
than a human "user"}.

[245:33+ 12.6.4.8.3 Defined input/output procedures]
Move the entirety of 12.6.4.8.2 (Executing defined input/output
data transfers) here. The remaining text in the current
12.6.4.8.3 properly belongs as part of the description of how
such transfers are executed, and explaining any part of how
the transfer is executed before describing the procedures seems
inappropriate.

[247:19 12.6.4.8.3p28 Defined input/output procedures]
Replace "shall not define" with "shall not reference, define"

[247:21+2 NOTE 12.45 Defined input/output]
Replace "shall not" with "is not allowed to".
(The note improperly expresses requirements.)

[250:16+ 12.7.1p5+ Wait operation] Insert a paragraph:

"If no error condition occurs during a wait operation for a unit, the
variable associated with the SIZE= specifier in the statement that
initiated the transfer, if any, becomes defined as specified in
12.6.2.15." {reference is to SIZE= specifier in a data transfer
statement}

[253:29+ 12.10.1p2+ Forms of the INQUIRE statement] Insert a paragraph:

"For inquiry by file, the file specified need not exist or be connected
to a unit.  If it is connected to a unit, the inquiry is being made
about the connection and about the unit connected."

2. Optional edits at the editor's discretion
--------------------------------------------
[228:27 12.5.6.7p1] Replace "This" with "It" {because "It" seems to be
more common among similar descriptions}.

[230:5 12.5.6.16p1] Replace "This" with "It" {because "It" seems to be
more common among similar descriptions}.

[230:10 12.5.6.17p1] Replace "This" with "It" {because "It" seems to be
more common among similar descriptions}.

3. Edits rejected
-----------------

[223:22 12.4p2(10) Internal files] Before "formatted" insert
"nonadvancing".
(Because nonadvancing internal I/O is not a thing (C1221))

[225:31-34 12.5.4p5 Conection of a file to a unit]
Before "main program" insert "program with a"
because program units other than the main program might perform
input/output operations.
(The existing text already says what is needed and is unambiguous.)

[226:5 12.5.5p1 OPEN statement] Delete "the" before "prior" because
"the" implies there is exactly one prior execution of an OPEN statement.
(No, it doesn't.)

[234:10-13 12.6.2.3 NML= specifier in a data transfer statement]
Move 12.6.2.3 NML= to [235:3+ 12.6.2.9+] between
ID= and PAD=, to put subclauses in alphabetical order.
(NML, like FMT and UNIT, is special in that the keyword is optional,
so it belongs grouped with those.)

The following three edits are replaced with edits in section 1.

[239:3-4 12.6.4.1p1] Delete the paragraph because the direction of
transfer has not been determined, and the unit has not yet been
identified.  It reappears below.

[239:8+ 12.6.4.1p2(2)+] Insert a list item:

"(2a) Execution of a WRITE or PRINT statement for a file that does not
exist creates the file.  If an error occurs, steps 3 through 8 are
skipped." {Existing steps 3-8.}

[239:26+ 12.6.4.1p3(2)+] Insert a list item:

"(2a) Execution of a WRITE or PRINT statement for a file that does not
exist creates the file.  If an error occurs, steps 4 through 8 are
skipped." {Existing steps 4-8.}

[241:31 12.6.4.5.1p8] Before "transferring" insert "evaluating an
expression in an input list item or" {because a function therein is not
required to be pure.}
(Unnecessary per 10.1.14p2(2))

[245:40 12.6.4.8.3p12] After "invoked" insert "by the processor during
execution of a parent data transfer statement" {because it is not
prohibited to invoke a defined input/output procedure directly}.
(Replaced by edits in section 1.)

[247:21 12.6.4.8.3p28] At the end of the paragraph append a sentence: "A
defined input procedure, and any procedures invoked therefrom, shall not
reference any storage unit referenced by or associated with any input
item, or any specifier that might be changed by an active parent data
transfer statement.  A defined output procedure, and any procedures
invoked therefrom, shall not reference any part of an internal file
designated by the \cf{unit} argument, or any storage unit associated
therewith." {Because the input items etc. might not yet be defined.}
(Replaced with edits in section 1.)

4. Questions without edits
--------------------------
JOR did not investigate these questions

[219:3-7 12.3.2p3] Is it processor dependent whether stdin, stdout, and
stderr exist?

[232:34 C1216] Why is namelist prohibited for direct access?  It can't
be because namelist input or output might require more than one record,
because formatted input or output could require more than one record.

[233:6-7 C1220] Why is list-directed prohibited for direct access?  It
can't be because list-directed input or output might require more than
one record, because formatted input or output could require more than
one record.

[251:3-4 12.7.2p3] What happens if the expression specified by the ID=
specifier is zero?  Is it the same as the specifier not appearing?

[252:8 12.8.3p1] Should "also may be" be "is"?

[256:12-17 12.10.2.10] Should the description of the ENCODING= specifier
include DEFAULT encoding, instead of producing UNDEFINED if the
connection is not using UTF-8 encoding?

[261:16+ 12.11.3p1(2)+] Is the variable specified in the SIZE= specifier
defined (or undefined) if an end-of-file condition occurs?
