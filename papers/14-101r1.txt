Subject:type-spec for ac-do-variable
Date: 2014 January 24

Reference: 14-007

Fortran 2008 added the ability to optionally specify the type of
the index-name directly in a forall-header (R752), allowing the
programmer to specify the type of this construct entity at the
point where it is created, rather than inheriting the type from
the enclosing scope. This applies to FORALL and DO CONCURRENT.

This feature was not also applied to the ac-do-variable in an
array constructor implied-DO (R473), which, as a statement
entity it would also benefit from the option of local type
specification. This omission creates an asymmetry in the language
that should be corrected in the next standard.

A similar case can be made for the data-i-do-variable in
data-implied-do (R539), which is also a statement entity.

Note that io-implied-do does not create a statement or construct
entity, so this issue does not apply there.

Suggested edits, in reference to 14-007, are provided to correct
this defect.

EDITS to 14-007:

[87:3] 4.8, R473

Replace R473 with:

R473 ac-implied-do is ( ac-value-list, [type-spec ::]
                      ac-implied-do-control )

Alternatively, the optional type-spec could be added to R474,
but the edits to 16.4 are cleaner if it's R473.

Insert new constraint C4110a

C4110a (R473) type-spec in ac-implied-do shall specify type
integer

Consider also qualifying the references to type-spec in C4105,
C4106 and C4107 (all for R469) so as to reduce possible
confusion with the different type-spec applying to R473.

In C4105, 4106, 4107: replace "type-spec" with "type-spec in
ac-spec"

[107:11-14], 5.4.7, R539

Replace R539 with:

R539 data-implied-do is ( data-i-do-object-list, [type-spec ::]
                        data-i-do-variable =
                        scalar-int-constant-expr,
                        scalar-int-constant-expr
                        [, scalar-int-constant-expr] )

Insert new constraint C572a

C572a (R539) type-spec shall specify type integer

[448:25-31] 16.4

Replace the second sentence of paragraph 4 with the following
two sentences:

It is a scalar variable. If type-spec appears in data-implied-do
or ac-implied-do, the variable has the specified type and type
parameters; otherwise it has the type and type parameters that
it would have if it were the name of a variable in the innermost
executable construct or scoping unit that includes the DATA
statement or array constructor, and this type shall be integer
type; it has no other attributes.
