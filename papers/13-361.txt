1. Monday, October 14, 2013  8:00 AM
------------------------------------

1.1 Opening business

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair - Dan Nagle

   Dan Nagle welcomed everyone to meeting 202.  Our major work is on the
   coarrays TS and on interps.

   During the meeting, Dan noted that the F2015 wish list was not closed
   to WG5 until the Jun-2014 meeting.  At m203 in Feb-2014 meeting, J3
   will polish the F2015 wish list.

1.1.2 Adoption of the agenda - Dan Nagle

** motion: Adopt the agenda (moved by Cohen/seconded by Menard):
           passed with unanimous consent {uc}

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 201 minutes - Dan Nagle

** motion: move paper 13-295 as minutes of meeting 201 (Long/Chen): uc

1.1.4 NCITS/OMC report - Dan Nagle

   NCITS will send bills for next year 1st Nov.  There was an objection to
   Van paying Dan when Dan registered the domain name ($375 for 10 years
   registration on register.com).  J3 unanimously passed our ballot,
   approving Steve Lionel as International Rep starting in 2014.

   As always, Dan drew everyone's attention to:

     the INCITS Anti-Trust Guidelines and INCITS Patent Policy is intended
     as a reminder and available on the INCITS website at

      http://www.incits.org/standards-information/legal-info.

1.1.5 WG23 report - Dan Nagle

   The convenor, Jim Moore, retired so the committee is reorganizing

1.1.6 ISO/WG5 report - Van Snyder (not present)

   There will be no US TAG meeting Thursday.  13-010 is the current work
   plan as a .pdf, created by Van, in the pre-meeting.  Van will add the
   LaTex sources to the post meeting.

1.1.7 J11 Liaison report - Dan Nagle

   Dan had nothing to report on the C Standards group.  He is on the J11
   email list - it is a low volume list.  It appears new development will
   go into C++.

1.1.8 MPI Liaison report - Bill Long

   September MPI meeting in Spain approved the modifications to the MPI-3
   Fortran interface to fix broken uses of BIND(C). No more MPI Fortran
   meetings are planned until a BoF at SC13.

   Next up is the discussion of MPI-4.  Eventually MPI needs to specify
   the interaction with Fortran 2008, particularly coarrays.  This will
   be referred to an existing PGAS working group that is handling UPC
   and not the MPI Fortran working group.

1.1.9 OpenMP Liaison report - Bill Long

   OpenMP 4.0 is still being developed.  The OpenMP committee needs to
   specify interactions with coarrays but it is way too soon for that -
   they need to incorporate full F2003 first.

1.1.10 UPC Liaison report - Bill Long

   UPC 1.3 will be officially released around Supercomputing.  It is
   still a spec;  there is no movement toward any standardization
   process.  They are adding atomics and non-blocking copy functions
   as well as clarifying some confusing aspects of UPC 1.2.

1.1.11 Treasurer's report - Van Snyder (by e-mail)

   Opening treasurer's report:
    Bank balance at end of 201:   $2,627.90
    Domain registration (7/23):      375.00-
                                  ---------
    Current bank balance:         $2,252.90

   There is no meeting fee for this meeting according to the notice.

   [Secretary's note:  J3 m199 Oct-2012 minutes 12-202 state:
    motion: there will be no meeting fee for this meeting m199 or for
            the next 2 meetings {m200 and m201} (Whitlock/Cohen): uc
    There are no such motions for m202 or m203.]

1.1.12  Beginning membership report - Stan Whitlock (by e-mail)

5.5 Treasurers report - Van Snyder (summary after the meeting)

   Stormi decided to comp us for the refreshments, so there were no hotel
   expenses.  The host did not ask for reimbursement for meeting expenses.
   There were no other fees either.  So the treasurer's report is "nothing
   to report".


   18 Oct 2013 Closing balance                      $2,252.90

   There is no "Meeting 202 Treasurer's Report" [Snyder]
