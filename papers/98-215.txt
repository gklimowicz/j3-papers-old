Subject: Options for Defining File Storage Units

Currently the Fortran standard has defined the unit of measure for file
operations (file storage
units) to be processor-dependent.  This has allowed vendors of Fortran
compilers, even on the same or
similar platforms, to define the file storage units differently.  This is a
useless and needless irreguarlity.
The lack of a common definition that is the same from one processor to the
next is a hindrance to
portability, with consequent costs to developers of applications.

  The main objection to selecting a specific definition of file storage
units is that it could be a
hindrance to technological development in the future.  Although the 8-bit
byte is the most common
storage unit in current practice, by no means is it the only one.  In the
past, several popular machines
(e.g., Control Data Corporation and Univac) had word sizes that were not
integral multiples of bytes.
 It is possible that some future machines could be ternary (base 3) rather
than binary in nature.  It
would be harmful to the Fortran language and to the development of software
technology in general
to define file storage units in a way that did not allow for unforseen
technological developments.

  Following are four (4) possible options for consideration of what the
Fortran 2000 standard should
define for file storage units.

       1. Require that file storage units be 8-bit bytes.

       2. If the hardware and operating system define and use 8-bit bytes,
require that the file storage
     units be 8-bit bytes; otherwise the file storage units are
processor-dependent.

       3. Recommend, but not require, that the file storage units be 8-bit
bytes.

       4. Do nothing.  This would the current practice of defining file
storage units to be completely
     processor-dependent.
