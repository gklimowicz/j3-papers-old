Subject: Interp F03/0110  Restoring dropped restriction on ENTRY
Date: 2007 November 15

NUMBER: F03/XXXX
TITLE: Restoring dropped restriction on ENTRY
KEYWORDS: ENTRY
DEFECT TYPE: ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

	It appears that a hard restriction found in ANSI X3.9-1978
	was dropped when we published Fortran 90.  The restriction
	on page 15-13 of the FORTRAN 77 standard says

	>In a function subprogram, a variable name that is the same
	>as an entry name must not appear in any statement that
	>precedes the appearance of the entry name in an ENTRY
	>statement, except in a type-statement.

	so
		FUNCTION S()
		T = 13.0
		ENTRY T()
		END
	is not standard-conforming.

	The restriction appears to be missing from Fortran 90, 95, 2003.
	Should it still be in force ?


ANSWER:
	Yes, it should. It was not intended to add new functionality
	to ENTRY in Fortran 90, 95, 2003.  It is of course not timely to ask
        for a corrigendum to Fortran 90 or Fortran 95.


EDITS: At  [04-007:283:36-38]

	After the words "as a dummy argument" add "or as the entry-name"

	"In a subprogram, a name that appears as a dummy argument in an ENTRY
	statement shall not appear in an executable statement preceding that ENTRY
	statement"
