NUMBER:  F03/0034
TITLE:  IEEE_LOGB()
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, ieee_logb()
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

What is ieee_logb(denormal)?  Is it of the hardware representation,
or is it as if the hardware had an unbounded exponent range?

What is ieee_logb(NaN)?  ieee_logb(-INF)?  ieee_logb(+INF)?

ieee_logb() should be defined as if the hardware representation had
an unbounded exponent range.

ieee_logb(NaN) should be the same NaN; shall be a NaN.

ieee_logb(-INF) shall be +INF

ieee_logb(+INF) shall be +INF

ANSWER:

Case (i) of 14.10.12 correctly specifies that if the value of X is
denormal, its unbiased exponent is returned, that IEEE_LOGB(X) is
equal to EXPONENT(X)-1.  That this conclusion is true is the subject
of F2003 interp F03/0054, answered in Corrigendum 1.

For consistency with the IEEE International Standard, edits are
also supplied for the case where X is infinite and X is NaN.

EDITS:

Page and line numbers refer to 04-007.

Subclause 14.10.12 "IEEE_LOGB (X)" Result value [376:17+] add:

  "Case (iii) If IEEE_SUPPORT_INF(X) is true and X is infinite, the
              result is +infinity.
   Case (iv) If IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN(X) is true and X is a NaN, the result
             is a NaN."
