Subject: Unresolved issue 143

1. Introduction

Parts of the ALLOCATABLE syntax have not been changed to reflect the
introduction of allocatable scalars.

Actually, neither have the semantics been changed - did we really add
ALLOCATABLE scalars or not?  If so, can I grumble about certain obvious
places
(ALLOCATABLE components, ALLOCATABLE attribute and ALLOCATABLE statement)
all
still requiring an array?

2. Edits

{Allow scalar allocatable components}
[43:16] Before "a" insert "scalar or".

{Allow scalars to have the ALLOCATABLE attribute}
[83:34] Change "array.  Such an array" to
        "object.  If it is an array it"

{Change the ALLOCATABLE statement to use <object-name>}
[91:20-22] Change "<array-name>" to "<object-name>" thrice.

{Change the ALLOCATABLE statement to allow arrays}
[91:24] Change "arrays" to "objects".

{Add an ALLOCATABLE scalar to the example}
[91:27] After "B (:)" insert ", SCALAR"
[91:28] After ", B" insert ", SCALAR"

{ALLOCATABLE statements now use <object-name>.}
[369:41] After "<save-stmt>," insert "<allocatable-stmt>,"
[370:3] Delete "an <allocatable-stmt> or in"

{Delete the J3 note.}
[370:4-11] Delete.
