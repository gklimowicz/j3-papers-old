----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F08/
TITLE: Add to introduction defined operations in specification exprs
KEYWORDS: specification, restricted, defined operator
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Fortran 2003 7.1.6 (Specification expressions), says on 141:12:

A restricted expression is an expression in which each operation is
intrinsic

Fortran 2008 7.1.11 says on 150:8:

A restricted expression is an expression in which each operation is
intrinsic or defined by a specification function

This new feature is not called out in the Introduction but should be.

ANSWER:

This was an oversight. An edit to correct the problem is supplied.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

Introduction, page xv. Add to the "Data declaration" list in
paragraph 2: "A defined operator may be used in a specification
expression."
