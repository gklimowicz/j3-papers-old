NUMBER: F03/00xx
TITLE: Are the IEEE_* elemental routines required
KEYWORDS: IEEE, elemental routines
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:

The descriptions for all of the IEEE elemental intrinsics listed in
14.9 say something like "shall not be invoked if
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) is false".

I believe this was to allow a careful programmer to do something
like

        if (IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(x)) then
               x = IEEE_SCALB(x,2)
        else
               x = x*4
        endif

and program around partial IEEE support.

But 14.9.2 says that "IEEE_ARITHMETIC contains the following
[routines] for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) [is] true"

I'd read that as saying the functions aren't there for cases where
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is false.  But, then, there is no way to
program around their absence.  The example above will fail at load
time because IEEE_SCALEB is absent.

Question.  If a processor provides the IEEE_ARITHMETIC module must it
provide versions of all of the intrinsics for all of the available
datatypes, including those for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE() is false.


ANSWER:

Yes, edits are provided to make this clear.

DISCUSSION:  It was intended that the above coding snippet could be
used by a careful programmer to program portably for processors which
have varying degrees of IEEE support.  This requires processors to
provide some stub function for each routine and for each non-IEEE
datatype they support.  If a program invokes on of the stub routines,
it is a run-time programming error.  Nevertheless, a program which
has references to the routines, but doesn't invoke them, must load
and execute.
