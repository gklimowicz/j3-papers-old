Subject: Interop: CONTIGUOUS for assumed rank
Date: 2011 February 17
References: N1838

DISCUSSION

The TR currently is silent on whether the CONTIGUOUS attribute is
allowed for an assumed-rank dummy argument.  An edit is provided to
say it is.

EDIT to N1838:

[3:31+] After constraint C535x1 in 2.2 Assumed-rank objects, add a new
paragraph:

"An assumed-rank object may have the CONTIGUOUS attribute."
