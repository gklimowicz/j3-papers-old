Discussion: Here are two edits, the need for which became apparent
during the discussion of 16-179r1 and 16-181r1.

Edits to 16-007r1:

[199:4-5] In 8.6.2 Segments, para 1, replace the second sentence by
"Expressions within an image control statement are evaluated before
completion of the preceding segment."

[337:16-19] In 13.6 Collective subroutines, middle of para 2, replace
sentence "Before execution ... of a team." by "Before the first team
change, between one team change and the next, or after the last team
change, each image of the team shall execute the same sequence of
invocations of collective subroutines."
N.B. This edit supersedes those in 16-181r1 and 16-185r2 for this
sentence.
