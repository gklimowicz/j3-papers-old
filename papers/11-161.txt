Subject:   Type code for ptrdiff_t
Date: 2011 June 07
Reference: WG5/N1854

Discussion:
-----------

It is desirable to add the C type ptrdiff_t to the list of
interoperable types, since it is effectively the type we have
specified for CFI_index_t. It needs to be added to both the TR and to
Table 15.2 in the base standard.  Note that since ptrdiff_t is defined
in 7.17 of the C standard, the text at [429:28] in 10-007r1.pdf does
not require modification.


Edits to N1854:
--------------

[12:Table 5.2] Add a new Macro | C type pair following
CFI_type_intptr_t | intptr_t:

    "CFI_type_ptrdiff_t  |  ptrdiff_t"



[28:13-]  Add a new edit to 6.9 Edits to clause 15:

"{In 15.3.2 Interoperability of intrinsic types, Table 15.2, add a new
Named constant / C type pair in the Fortran type = INTEGER block,
following C_INTPTR_T | intptr_t, as follows}

     C_PTRDIFF_T  |  ptrdiff_t"
