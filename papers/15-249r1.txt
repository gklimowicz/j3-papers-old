Subject:    Interp: PURE, structure constructor with pointer subobject
Date: 2015 October 16

NUMBER: F08/0148
TITLE: Pointer subobject in structure constructor in pure procedure
KEYWORDS: pointer subobject, structure constructor, pure procedure
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the module

program P

  type :: T1
    integer, pointer :: P1
  end type T1

  type :: T2
    type(t1) :: P2
  end type T2

  type(t1), target :: V1

  allocate ( V1%p1, source = 42 )

contains

  pure subroutine S ( )
    type(t2) :: A
  1 a = t2(v1)
    a%p2%p1 = a%p2%p1 + 1
  end subroutine S

end program P

Item (3) in the list in constraint C1283 in subclause 12.7 prohibits
an object that is accessed by host or use association (and other
categories) to be the <expr> in a structure constructor that
corresponds to a component that has the POINTER attribute.  It is
silent concerning type constructors for types that have potential
subobject components with the POINTER attribute.

Is the statement labeled 1 permitted?  If so, was that intended?

ANSWER:

The statement labeled 1 was inadvertently allowed because V1
corresponds to a component of the structure constructor for type T2
that does not have the POINTER attribute.

An edit is provided to correct this mistake.

EDIT:

[312:35 12.7p2 C1283(3)] After "component" insert ", or that has a
pointer component at any level of component selection,".
