Subject:   Assignment to zero-length character
From:      Van Snyder

1. Introduction
===============

Walt Brainerd observed that the final sentence of 7.2.1.13p1, viz.

     "No value is assigned to the variable if it is of type character
      and zero length, or is an array of size zero."

could be construed to mean that this applies before consideration
whether the variable in an intrinsic assignment ought to the reallocated
because it is allocatable and has the wrong character length or the
wrong shape.

In light of 16.6.2p1, if the sentence were deleted (because it has no
effect) the confusion would also be deleted.  It was noted in subgroup,
however, that there is a problem with derived-type objects that have no
nonpointer components.
