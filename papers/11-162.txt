I am afraid that I tool my eye off the ball during the discussion,
but the wording is now too simple.  "The C address of the first
element" for arrays with negative strides means one thing if one
uses the Fortran sense of "first" and another if one means the C
sense.  There is a simple fix.


Edits to N1854:

[10:2] After "first element" add "in Fortran array element order".
