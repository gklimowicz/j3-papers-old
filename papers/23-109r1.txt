Subject: Support for Containers
Date: 2023-January-29

During meeting 216 at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, 11-15 June 2018, it
was decided that a revision of Fortran should include support to develop
containers, rather than support for specific containers such as lists,
trees, queues, ....

Paper 23-109 describes a comprehensive scheme to define containers.

It is posed as a technical specification.

One is urged to read Clause 3 first, to understand the motivation for
it, and study one use case.
