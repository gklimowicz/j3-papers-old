Subject: Issue 24 : co-array polymorphic assignment
Reference: J3/06-007

Discussion of Issue 24 (page 157)

The editor's argument is convincing. There is little to lose by not allowing
a polymorphic <variable> in an assignment statement if it is an allocatable
co-array or a co-indexed object.


Edits to J3/06-007

[157:16] Change "its dynamic type shall be the same as that of <expr>" to
"it shall not be polymorphic".
