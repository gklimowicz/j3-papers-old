		Report III from subgroup Chapter 8 onwards


N1524 (cont.)

Page and line numbers in paper N1524 refer to 02-007r3. We use these
line numbers as well as those from the present draft (03-007).

    paper 03-173

        No edit is proposed.

    paper 03-180

        272:13 now refers to 278:14.  WG5 agrees; proposed edit:
               278:14 Insert "the execution of the" before "defined".
               WG5 suggests no edit is necessary for finalization.
               Finalization is different from the other mechanisms.

    paper 03-183

        Now about 14.8.  WG5 agrees; proposed edits:
        371:1   Replace "operators" by "operations".
        371:6-7 Replace "operators for" by "operations of".
        371:8   Insert "the" before "IEEE" and "are" before "valid".

    paper 03-186

        No edit is proposed.

    paper 03-188r1

        No edit is proposed.

Poor typesetting of 9.10.4 will solve itself because of renumbering
sections (13.8.2.x.x), so nothing needs to be done (edits in N1543).
