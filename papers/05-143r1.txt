Subject: ADVANCE= specifier in child data transfer statements

NUMBER: F03/0052
TITLE: ADVANCE= specifier in child data transfer statements
KEYWORDS: ADVANCE=, UDDTIO, data transfer
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The appearance of the ADVANCE= specifier in a child data transfer
statement is not prohibited, but such an appearance is meaningless.
9.5.3 of Fortran 2003 states that the file is positioned after data
transfer only if the statement is not a child data transfer.  The
appearance of the ADVANCE= specifier in such a statement would seem to
serve only to confuse people maintaining a program that contains it.

Was it intended that the ADVANCE= specifier should be allowed to
appear in a child data transfer statement?


ANSWER:

Yes, it was intended that the ADVANCE= specifier should be allowed to
appear in a child data transfer statement.  Such a specifier has no
effect.  Note that a user defined derived type I/O routine can be called
explicitly by the user, and in that case, the I/O statements therein are
not child data transfer statements.


EDITS:

None.
