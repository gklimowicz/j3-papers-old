Discussion:
-----------

The syntax rule for <stat-variable> is R929 at [140:25] in 9.7.1.1
Form of the ALLOCATE statement. It is a <scalar-int-variable>.  There
is no restriction on the minimum range, unlike what we require for
most of the STAT arguments to intrinsic procedures. Realistically,
sets of Fortran error codes have more than 127 distinct values, so
specifying a 8-bit integer will very likely be inadequate and not
portable.  Text should be added in this subclause recommending that
programs should provide an integer variable with a decimal range of at
least 4.


Edit to WG5/N2137:
------------------

[142:17+] In 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement, after the last
paragraph of the subclause (just before the last Note in the
subclause, 9.19) add a new paragraph:

"A <stat-variable> should have a decimal range of at least four, to
ensure that the processor-dependent error code can be represented in
it."
