This is a response to 06-345r1.


Q. [86:17+] In Note 5.3, replace the end "in a module where it is PRIVATE"
   with "that module".
A. Agreed after fixing.

EDIT. [86:17+5] "a module where it is PRIVATE" -> "that module".

Q. [89:6] I believe what C525 is trying to say is that "a co-array shall
   not be a constant or a function result". This seems clearer and more
   specific to me.
A. Ok as is.

Q. [89:9+] In Note 5.10 delete "on an image" from "allocated on an image"
A. After that it is blinding obvious that that whole sentence is vacuously true.

EDIT. [89:9+4-5] Delete "An allocatable ... defined."

Q. [89:11+] In Note 5.11, we should add an example of an assumed-size
   array and also clarify that the array pointer and allocatable examples
   are deferred-shape arrays.
A. No, everyone who wants to use assumed-size arrays is old enough to remember
   F77 as being new-fangled and therefore does not need such an example.
   In any case, Note 5.11 doesn't appear to be about this topic.


Q. [88:22] Isn't non_contiguous_array%component always non-contiguous?
A. Nailing down obscure details is not that useful.
   Anyway, if component is a zero-length character it probably is
   contiguous on some processors.
