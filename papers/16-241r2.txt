Subject: Missing constraint on VALUE
Date: 2016 October 11


Interp F08/0096 added a constraint to prohibit an array dummy argument
with VALUE in a BIND(C) procedure. This was included in Corrigendum 3
for F2008.  This was done as an edit to an existing constraint.
Unfortunately, TS 29113 affected the same constraint, effectively
eliminating the change from Corrigendum 3.  The restriction from
F08/0096 (and Corrigendum 3) needs to be restored.

Also, many of the constraints on BIND(C) procedures appear under
"Function subprograms", which is rather unnatural.  These should be
collected together into the general subclause on procedure subprograms,
15.6.2.1.

Edits to 16-007r2:

[101:26] 8.5.6.1 General (under 8.5.6 CODIMENSION attribute), C826,
  Move constraint "C826 A coarray ... <proc-language-binding-spec>.".
  to 15.6.2.1, and reworded, as specified below.

[330:20+] 15.6.2.1 General, at the end of the subclause, insert text,
  from elsewhere as follows (note reordering!):
     R1531 <proc-language-binding-spec>...
     C1561
     C1563 with hyperlinking of "interoperable scalar variable" to
            "18.3.5 Interoperability of scalar variables".
     C1562
     C1564 with the hyperlinking of the terms assumed-type and
           interoperable
     C1565
     C826 reworded as
     "C15mm If <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for a procedure,
            it shall not have a dummy argument that is a coarray."
  and new constraint
     "C15nn If <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for a procedure,
            it shall not have an array dummy argument with the VALUE
            attribute."
{Collect relevant constraints for <proc-language-binding-spec> together.}

[330:34-331:6] 15.6.2.2 Function subprogram,
  Move BNF for <proc-language-binding-spec> and its constraints,
  as specified above.
