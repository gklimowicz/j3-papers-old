INTRODUCTION:

Papers 11-175r1 and 11-208r1 dealt with the changes to the
semantics introduced with 11-168r2, but did not complete the job.
This paper prohibits establishing a descriptor via CFI_section
and CFI_select_part.

EDITS to N1854:

[17:12]  Delete "a C object large enough to hold"

[17:25]  Replace "establishes a C descriptor" by
         "updates the C descriptor pointed to by the argument /result/"

[17:29]  Replace "object pointed to" by "C descriptor pointed to";
         delete "to the C descriptor established"

[17:30]  Replace "that object" by "that C descriptor"

[18:9]   Delete "a C object large enough to hold"

[18:26]  Replace "establishes a C descriptor" by
         "updates the C descriptor pointed to by the argument /result/"

[18:30-31]  Replace "object pointed to" by "C descriptor pointed to";
         delete "to the C descriptor established"; replace "that object"
         by "that C descriptor"
