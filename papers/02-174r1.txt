[204:40]    Delete "of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module".

[204:43]    Replace "of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module" with

derived-type input/output" into the index (\index\{resolving
procedure references!derived-type input/output\}}).]

{\tdef}).  Insert "is one that" after "item".]

[218:8]     [Which "variable specified?"  Editor: "variable
specified" ==> scalar-int-variable in the IOSTAT=specifier".]

[218:9]     [Editor: Insert "the" before "iomsg-variable".]

[218:10-11] [Which "variable specified?"  Editor: "variable
specified" ==> scalar-int-variable in the SIZE= specifier".]

[218:15]    [Which "statement specified?"  Editor: "specified" ==>

[219:8]         [Editor: "variable specified" ==> "scalar-int-
variable".]

[219:13-14]     [It wasn't necessary to mention both the subclause
title and the cross reference in 9.5.3.7.2.  It isn't necessary

ISO_FORTRAN_ENV".]

[219:16-17]     [It wasn't necessary to mention both the subclause

Answers to questions asked

1.  Q.  [9.9.1-3]   Can more than one of error, end-of-file and
end-of-record conditions occur simultaneously?  If so, which one
gets precedence of processing?
    A.  Section 9.9.4 says that conditions are handled in the order
    error, then end-of-file, then end-of-record.

2.  Q.  [220:3-4]   Does this mean "change the unit number" or
"change the contents of the file identified by the unit?"
    A.  This refers to an internal unit, which is a CHARACTER
    variable on an internal I/O, which cannot be modified during
    the I/O operation.
