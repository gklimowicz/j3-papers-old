[511:27+] Insert a list item:

"o whether a flag that is quiet on entry to a scoping unit that does not
   access IEEE_FEATURES, IEEE_EXCEPTIONS, or IEEE_ARITHMETIC is
   signaling on exit (14.1);"

[511:29,31,33] At the end of each of these three items, append "(14.3)".

[511:33+] Insert a list item:

"o whether an exception signals at the end of a sequence of statements
   that has no invocations of IEEE_GET_FLAG, IEEE_SET_FLAG,
   IEEE_GET_STATUS, IEEE_SET_STATUS, or IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE, in which
   execution of an operation would cause it to signal, if no value of a
   variable depends upon the result of the operation (14.3);"

[511:36+] Insert list items:

"o whether IEEE_INVALID signals after IEEE_INT if the result value is
   not representable in the representation method of the result
   (14.1.11);"

"o which argument is the result value of IEEE_MAX_NUM, IEEE_MAX_NUM_MAG,
   IEEE_MIN_NUM, or IEEE_MIN_NUM_MAG if both arguments are quiet NaNs
   (14.11.17, 14.11.18, 14.11.19, 14.11.20);"
