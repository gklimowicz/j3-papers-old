Subject: LBOUND of array structure component

NUMBER: F03/0077
TITLE: LBOUND of array structure component
KEYWORDS: LBOUND, lower bounds, bounds, structure component, array sections
DEFECT TYPE: CLARIFICATION/ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

   What is the result of this program:

   PROGRAM
      TYPE :: t
         REAL :: x
      END TYPE

      TYPE(t) :: y(-5:5)

      WRITE(*,*) LBOUND(y%x), LBOUND(y(3:5)%x)

   END PROGRAM

ANSWER:

Option 1) The program prints "1 1"

Option 2) The program prints "-5 1"

Note: There are compilers on both side of the spectrum, though it seems
the majority print "1 1". I believe the intended answer is "1 1".

Discussion:

The definition of LBOUND:

"If ARRAY is a whole array or array structure component and either
ARRAY  is an assumed-size array of rank DIM or dimension DIM of ARRAY
has  nonzero extent, LBOUND (ARRAY, DIM) has a value equal to the lower
bound for subscript DIM of ARRAY. Otherwise the result value is 1."

uses the phrase "array structure component", which can be read as
"structure component that is an array" (which y%x and y(3:5)%x are), or
"array component of a structure" (which neither y%x and y(3:5)%x are).
The first reading says that the answer is equal to the lower bound of
y%x, but the standard does not actually specify what the lower bounds of
array sections are (since they cannot be subscripted). The second
reading says that the answer is "1 1", and I believe it is the intended
one.

EDITS:

Either:

1) Modify the words for LBOUND to say something alike "array component
of a scalar of derived type" instead of "array structure component", or

2) Make an array component of a scalar of derived type be a "whole
array" (this may have other consequences, but seems more intuitive than
just tweaking the definition of LBOUND).

Possibly also rewrite NOTE 6.6 to make it explicitly clear that
something can be both a component and a section (assuming this is the
intention), for example, add the sentence: "Some forms of <data-ref> are
both a structure component and an array section."
