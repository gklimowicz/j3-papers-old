        Goals for this meeting are

          .  We cannot create replies to the US public comment period
             comments since the comment period is still open

          .  We will finish polishing the Enhanced Module Facility
             Technical Report and send it to John Reid for a vote
             starting in December, 2003

          .  There will be no interpretations processing at this
             meeting

          .  We will start talking about the contents of the next
             revision of the Forran Standard, using N1496 as the
             template for suggested new features
