Subject:  Initialization expressions

Fortran parameters are very important to scientific and
numerical programming, in which it is necessary to have
values that are both global and constant, to ensure that
they are consistent throughout the program, regardless of
context, and are not modified.

However, parameters are second-class citizens in that
you can't use many of the powerful intrinsic functions
when computing an initial value of a variable or the
value of a parameter.

This proposal allows cosines, logarithms, and other such
intrinsic functions in initialization expressions.

The counter argument that a compiler should not be required
to access the entire math library no longer seems relevant
with the use of dynamically linked libraries and only those
functions referenced are accessed.

The counter argument of inconsistent results when cross
compiling is much less severe with the adoption of IEEE
standard arithmetic.  However, people that do numerical
computing have always had to adjust to getting slightly
different results when the same mathematical expression
is computed in different contexts (e.g., I/O and assignment),
and this will be no different.

Proposal:

128:25-26 Delete ", the exponentiation ... power,"

129:4-14 Replace with

   (4) A reference to an elemental intrinsic function, where
       each argument is an initialization expression.

129:NOTE 7.11 Delete

129:15-17 Replace with

   (5) A reference to a transfomrational intrinsic function
       other than NULL, where each argument is an
       initialization expression.

129:18-23 Interchange items (6) and (7).

130:NOTE 7.12

   Add new examples after DIGITS (X) + 4:

      4.0 * atan(1.0)
      ceiling(number_of_decimal_digits / log10(radix(0.0)))

   Delete last four lines
