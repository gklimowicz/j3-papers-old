Subject:  Character Assignment in GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE

  As an integration issue, it is desirable to make the rules for the use of character arguments of intrinsic
procedures as uniform as possible.  This paper provides edits to change the language for the
GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE intrinsic subroutine to use the usual rules for character assignment.

Edits.
            [306:17-22] Replace the last four (4) sentences for the VALUE argument with the following:
It is assigned the value of the environment variable specified by NAME.  If the environment variable does not
have a value, does not exist, or if the processor does not support environment variables, VALUE is assigned all
blanks.
