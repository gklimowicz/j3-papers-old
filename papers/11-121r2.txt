DISCUSSION

Unresolved Technical Issue TR14 points out that interoperability of
interfaces with assumed-length character dummy arguments should be
added to paragraph 4 of the introduction. Paragraph 2 should be
similarly modified.

Edits are supplied to do this.

EDITS to N1838:

[v:para2:2] In Introduction, para 2, line 2, replace

"that are assumed-shape arrays, or dummy arguments with the Fortran
allocatable, pointer, or optional attributes"

with

"that are assumed-shape arrays, have assumed character length, or have
the Fortran ALLOCATABLE, OPTIONAL, or POINTER attributes."


[v:para2:3] In Introduction, para2, last sentence, replace "are" with
"is".


[v:para4:2] In Introduction, para 4, line 2, replace

"that specify assumed-shape dummy arguments, or dummy arguments with
the allocatable, pointer, or optional attributes."

with

"that specify dummy arguments that are assumed-shape arrays, have
assumed character length, or have the Fortran ALLOCATABLE, OPTIONAL,
or POINTER attributes."
