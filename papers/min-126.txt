2    Opening Business
2.1  Meeting Objectives & Chair's Report
     1.  Continue processing interpretations
     2.  Respond to WG5 Berchtesgaden Resolutions
     3.  Plan for the 1995 revision
2.1.2     Berchtesgaden Resolution B9
     note:     A short discussion of this resolution took
               place to inform those who were not in
               attendance at the WG5 meeting of the intent.
     Schonfelder: My understanding is that the second list
               is expected to be requirements, i.e., WG5
               would be cross if we didn't  work on those
               unless we had good technical reasons.
     Weaver:   Any additional requirements that we bring
               next year must be accompanied by rather
               complete proposals.
     Bierman:  We should use a one-third positive vote to
               forward a requirement.
     Hoffert:  For the next year, we need to work on those
               that WG5 has requested, but we also should
               prepare complete proposals on any additional
               requirements that we wish to see added to the
               1995 revision.
     Ellis:    Note that WG5 expects that we follow this
               list in roughly a priority order.  Given that
               they all have been addressed, additional
               requirements with the appropriate analysis
               may be brought forward.  WG5 does expect that
               we will subcontract some of the work as
               appropriate.
     Hendrickson: Fortran 95 should not be everything we can
               get done between now and 1995.
2.2  Adoption of the Final Agenda
     Discussion Leader: Jerry Wagener
     Ellis:    I would like to see the agenda distributed
               with as part of the premeeting.
     Motion:   (Hirchert/Lahey) Adopt the agenda as
               modified.
     Action:   Motion passed by unanimous consent.
2.3  Membership/Attendance Report
     Discussion Leader: Rich Kelble
     At the end of the last meeting there were 30 members.
               Andrew Tait resigned between meetings leaving
               29 members at the beginning of this meeting,
               15 of whom are present or represented.
     Seven members will be in jeopardy of losing their
               membership if they don't attend this meeting.
2.4  Approval of Meeting 125 Minutes
     Discussion Leader: Rich Kelble
     Reference: 93-200
     Weaver:   Future updates of the 006 will be based on
               the interpretations summary (see section 4.0
               of the minutes).
     Motion:   (Kelble/Martin) Approve the minutes of
               meeting 125 as modified by 93-200.
     Action:   Motion passed by unanimous consent.
2.5  Review of the Action Items from Meeting 125
     Reference:   Minutes of meeting 125
     1. Andrew Tait:  Make rules about the use of page and
        line numbers in 006.  At meeting 124, a straw vote
        on whether they should appear was (21-0-3), so the
        rules should include the form and location of page
        and line numbers in 006.

        Status:  Closed -- Page and line numbers will be
        enclosed in [] and may be placed anywhere within the
        text.

     2. Jerry Wagener discuss with Andrew Tait:  A subgroup
        field should be added to the 006 items.

        Status:  Closed -- This has been ruled not
        necessary.

     3. Andrew Tait::  Make a ruling on the format of
        standard citations in the 006.  Currently, some are
        enclosed in quotation marks and some are indented.

        Status:  Closed -- Citations must be distinct.  If
        any are not, inform the editor.

2.6  X3/OMC (SPARC) Report
     There was nothing to report this meeting.
2.7  ISO/WG5 Report
     Discussion Leader:  Jeanne Martin
     Martin:   Let's take turns giving our impressions of
               last week's meeting.
     Bierman:  WG5 started with many requirements and was
               able to work in down to a small number.
     Ellis:    There is a new relationship between WG5 and
               X3J3.  There is trust between the groups.
     Hoffert:  A key indicator was the vote on item 13 from
               the defect index (006) as it was a sign of
               cooperation.  Resolution B9 was another sign
               of renewed trust as it does not attempt to
               micromanage X3J3.  It gives us timely
               additions in the 1995 revision, e.g. HPF
               features.
     Hirchert: The votes were easy.  There was consensus in
               most cases.
     Kelble:   The entire group worked hard and much was
               accomplished.
     Lahey:    It was more enjoyable than past meetings as
               people were working together.
     Schonfelder: The Varying String Module will be complete
               for forwarding to SC22 in the next few weeks.
     Weaver:   The meeting ran by consensus building which
               is a sign of growing trust.
     Philips:  There was growing trust.  The emphasis was on
               what and not how.  X3J3 must get its act
               together regarding what our requirements are.
     Martin:   I was surprised by WG5 accepting so much of
               HPF.  There were only a few edits to the
               strategic plan.  Only the edits in the defect
               index are being forwarded as the corrigenda.
               The defect index will also be forwarded to
               SC22.  The Varying String Module will be
               forwarded after a 30 day WG5 letter ballot.
               It will be part of a multipart standard.  The
               bindings report will also be forwarded to
               SC22.
     Hendrickson: How enthusiastic was WG5 for HPF?
     answer:   They generally favored the rule of thumb that
               the majority of HPF programs should run with
               little or no change on a Fortran 95
               processor.
2.8  Resolution B9 Assignments
     Discussion Leader: Jerry Wagener
     Reference: 93-204
     Lahey:    I will take item C1, CPU time.
     Bierman:  The X3J3 manager should be a specific persons
               not a subgroup.
     Ellis:    /OOF must prepare 2 papers for next meeting
               which may be premature as they first need to
               address the direction of OOF and present that
               to the committee.
     Philips:  I will have a list of volunteers for
               subcontracting shortly.  Three items don't
               have a required report at the next meeting.
     Hoffert:  In some places where the names are not
               certain, we should assign the tasks to /JOR
               at least for the moment.
     Hirchert: I read the 3 items not specifically requiring
               a report to be that you just take the
               referenced document as a basis for a paper.
     Lahey:    I too would like to see names instead of
               subgroups as the X3J3 manager.
     Wagener:  Perhaps the subgroup should give us a name to
               put here.
     Lahey:    I too feel that /OOF should present a general
               plan before pursuing any specific items.
     Schonfelder: Several of these items are not orthogonal
               and should be considered together by a
               subgroup.
     Weaver:   Rather than having an X3J3 subgroup
               subcontract, Jerry should ask the head of
               national delegation to do some work and to
               submit this work to X3J3 by some given time.
     Martin:   WG5 was adamant that with A1 that the
               editorial work be minimal.  They don't want a
               rewrite of the standard.  In many cases, we
               also need to supply a requirement as well as
               the proposals.  There are several which do
               not have requirements, e.g., A2, A3, and A4.
     Hendrickson: The X3J3 manager column should be split in
               2: the subgroup and the X3J3 champion who
               will read and promote the papers from any
               subcontractor on that issue.  We can not
               assign an item to a subcontractor until we
               all agree on what we want.
     Schonfelder: Even when there are subcontractors, X3J3
               must look at the resultant work and determine
               if it can be accomplished.
     Weaver:   For each items to be subcontracted there must
               be a scope of work supplied by us and it
               should be a short document.
     Ellis:    At WG5 it was suggested that any member body
               which takes on subcontracting work should be
               prepared to send a representative to at least
               the X3J3 meeting where their proposal is
               presented.  Regarding not determining the
               subcontractor at this meeting, we just don't
               have enough time to wait until next meeting
               to get started.
     Hoffert:  We need to assign these tasks to groups which
               represent general functional areas.  Some of
               the assignments do that while others are in
               specific areas.  Jerry can't manage all of
               these items on his own.  It must be handled
               by others.  X3J3 must take charge of this
               work.  We are not putting another national
               body down by having them report to an X3J3
               subgroup.
     Hirchert: I viewed this as working like the early
               Fortran 90 work, i.e., present a tutorial at
               one meeting and bring a proposal to the next
               meeting.
     Bierman:  In subcontracting we must also remember to
               list what we don't want.
     Schonfelder: Some of these items, i.e., the edits and
               the HPF items, don't require any technical
               tutorials as the work is done.  The other
               items will require technical tutorials first
               to describe the issues and alternatives and
               the committee should agree on a direction
               before the edits are done.
     Wagener:  The X3J3 manager column will be broken into 3
               columns: the X3J3 subgroup, the X3J3 contact
               and the external contractor.  The last column
               will be the meeting 127 objectives.
2.9  Meeting 126 Assignments
     Ellis:    The priority of this meeting should be
               development and not interpretations.
     Schonfelder: We should emphasize those interpretations
               that are likely to cause aberrant
               implementations.
2.10 Standing Document 6 (93-006)
     note:     Only machine readable files in straight ASCII
               text will be accepted if current text is
               being replaced.
     Weaver:   We should separate the items which are WG5
               approved into another document.
     straw:    Do you prefer splitting the 006 into the 006
               and the 009 or the 006a and the 006b? (3-4-8)
     Wagener:  We will use the 006a and the 006b.
3    Committee Action Items
     As there is no secretary at the moment, the secretarial
     duties were rotated as follows:
         Monday:    Rich Kelble
         Tuesday:   Graham Barber
         Wednesday: Miles Ellis
         Thursday:  Keith Bierman
         Friday:    Ivor Philips
3.1  Interpretations Processing (July 13)
     Interpretation 000139 in 006
         Motion :   Adopt 000139 in 006 with minor editorial
                    changes which will be supplied by
                    subgroup to the acting 006 editor
         Mover  :   J. Martin
         Second :   L. Rolison
         After much discussion a straw vote was held :
         Straw Vote
                    Yes :          You like the
                    interpretation as proposed
                    No  :          You would like it fixed
                    up by subgroup
                    Result :  1-8-5
         The motion was withdrawn and the interpretation
         returned to subgroup for fixing
     Interpretation 000007 in 006
         After much discussion, the interpretation was
         reassigned to the PROC subgroup for future
         discussion with Janice Shepherd when the status of
         the interpretation can be straightened out.
3.2  Interpretations Processing (July 14)
3.2.1     PROC
     RFI #000135 (X3J3/93-208)  (Hirchert/Maine)
         Straw vote on whether to accept the approach
                    recommended:
         SV:        2/12/1
         Action:    Return to subgroup for reconsideration.
3.2.2     Not-PROC
     RFI #000097 (X3J3/93-211)  (Hendrickson/Schonfelder)
         Passed by Unanimous Consent.
     RFI #000081 (X3J3/93-213)  (Martin/Rolison)
         Passed by Unanimous Consent.
         Note that this interpretation assumes that
         interpretation 125, which was passed by 17-1 at
         meeting 125, is also approved by letter ballot.
         Both items should be balloted together.
     RFI #000134 (X3J3/93-215)  (Barber/Rolison)
         A possible contradiction with interpretation 12 was
                    identified.
         Action:    Return to subgroup for reconsideration.
     RFI #000142 (X3J3/93-218)  (Kelble/Rolison)
         Straw vote on whether to accept the approach in 93-
                    218 or to make a change to a constraint
                    (which would have to be checked):
         SV1:       3/2/8  (Leave as in proposal/change to a
                    constraint/undecided)
         Straw vote on whether to have the name change, as
                    recommended in the answer to Question 2,
                    or to leave the name unchanged:
         SV2:       4/1/9  (Different name as in
                    proposal/same name/undecided)
         Action:    Return to subgroup for reconsideration.
     RFI #000133 (X3J3/93-219)  (Rolison/Hendrickson)
         Passed by Unanimous Consent.
3.3  Technical Subgroup Processing (July 14)
3.3.1     /edit
     The charter of /edit is to create/maintain S007 and
     S008 (the new document and the edits to create it).
     This is quite separate from the corrigenda.
3.3.2     /parallel
     Current plan is to have some papers for meeting 127,
     and to complete the work by meeting 129.  The following
     short report was tabled:

     We interpret our "HPF" charter as follows:

         "The majority of HPF programs should run on a
         Fortran 95 conforming processor with minimal
         modification."

     This means that the parts of HPF which provide syntax
     or new intrinsics must be dealt with.  /parallel shall
     find an X3J3 member to coordinate all of the work.  We
     (/parallel) will liaise with various other groups to
     insure a sound proposal.

     Items to do:

     1.   FOR ALL statement
     2.   FOR ALL construct
     3.   Pure and possibly elemental functions
     4.   A solution to the "3 intrinsics"
          (a)  allow user-defined functions of some sort in
     specification statements
          (b)  include the "3" on some subset
     5.   FOR ALL and WHERE shall operate in a similar
     fashion.  Either both  nest or neither nests
     6.   We will NOT do anything with HPF directives or
     libraries
     7.   We will not handle EXTRINSIC
3.3.3     /JOR
     Bierman, Rolison and Hirchert gave brief reports on
     their plans for the items for which they were the X3J3
     contacts (see X3J3/93-204).
3.3.4     /OOF
     /OOF will propose that a new standing document (S009?)
     be created as a repository for new proposals, etc., in
     connection with the 1995 revision.
3.3.5     Tutorial on Pointer and Derived Type
     Initialisation
     Discussion Leader: Schonfelder
     Reference: X3J3/93-207
     Following the tutorial, three straw votes were taken:
         Straw vote on whether the preferred form of pointer
         initialisation was that proposed in the paper,
         using a special (typeless) constant, or the use of
         a function, e.g. NULLIFY:
         SV1:       7/6/1  (Function/typeless constant as in
                    paper/undecided)
         Straw vote on the acceptability of the two proposed
         forms of pointer initialisation:
         SV2:       3/6/4  (Not a function/not a typeless
                    constant/undecided)
         Straw vote on the preferred form of "constructor"
         (see section 4 of X3J3/93-207):
         SV3:       6/0/7  (Module/Type/undecided)
3.4  Miscellaneous Items (July 15)
3.4.1     X3T2 Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF)
     Wagener:  If someone has an interest in this area, we
               could use a volunteer to review and respond
               to their request.
3.4.2     Responses to the WG5 Resolutions
     Martin:   fix defect editor resolution.
     Ellis:    note this is a draft response, not final
               response (that will need to occur closer to
               the WG5 meeting, observed the oddness of some
               of this years resolutions due to premature
               finalization).
     Wagener:  Observation: the strategic plan is working.
               We should say so.
     Weaver:   "...plan" is weak. we should have a better
               formulation.
     Ellis:    "leverage is a noun" <Bierman I meant to look
               this up in my OED, but neglected to do so in
               a timely fashion> Long discussion of wording
               not recorded.
     No vote taken at this time.
3.5  Technical Subgroup Processing (July 15)
3.5.1     /parallel
     Report produced (see 3.3.2).  No further work planned
     this week, other than final selection of "advocate".
     Ultimately Dick Hendrickson revealed himself as the
     Parallel Advocate.
3.5.2     /OOF
     /OOF vote scheduled for c7, derived type I/O. Much
     discussion of the Forest and its Trees.
     Hendrickson: Too early to remove anything from
               consideration.
     Ellis:    Not too early; no way we will have enough
               resources.
     Schonfelder: "I am going to be like Janus" and agree
               with both of them.
     Hoffert:  Focus on key items, defer this.
     Weaver:   Read passage from the B* document, requested
               us to prepare a paper on the topic for WG5.
     Bierman:  We ought to be honest with ourselves and with
               WG5. Therefore we ought to say if we *plan*
               to work on this, if not say so *now*. This
               will enable WG5 members to volunteer if they
               desire.
     Martin:   were lots of old proposals. was too hard.
     Ellis:    can write a very simple paper later.
     Wagener:  likes Dick's idea. Please amend.
     Hoffert:  this would be "make work". Intent of WG5 is
               clear.
     Weaver:   Read B9 again. Focused on Leverage. Wants
               paper with details of old proposals. This
               would facilitate WG5 volunteering.
     Lahey:    I learned a lot during this debate. I learned
               that there were old proposals. We should put
               this into the formal response.
     Hendrickson: aren't opposed. why was this put on the
               list? <Bierman: this made more sense at the
               time>
     Martin:   must do something. echoes of Wagener's
               argument.
     Ellis:    list constructed by black art. c7 is lowest
               on the wish list. May be more a reflection of
               it not being *opposed* by anyone.
     Maine:    25-x-x do something; but   0 votes for 1995.
     Wagener:  intro of Kees Ampt from Netherlands.
     Adams:    supports removal of c7. assign a WG5 member
               to do the work.
     Ampt:     this is a "road sign". Don't do anything to
               prevent it.
     Bierman:  call the question 7-6
     Ellis:    unreasonable to assign the task to WG5, they
               assigned it to us. Request that the text be
               amended to reflect the WG5 vote (viz. do it,
               but not necessarily in 1995). Wording to the
               effect "In view of the WG5 votes, lack of J3
               resource, postpone c7 until 2K revision.
     Lahey:    too much time invested. This has already
               consumed a 1/2 hour of committee time +
               subgroup time.
     Vote:     motion as amended: 12-1 motion PASSED.
3.5.3     /edit
     /edit paper 229 will appear soon, defer discussion
               until then.
3.5.4     /imp
     /imp met last night. lots of votes. a paper is in
               progress.
3.5.2     /JOR
     /ieee worked deferred until papers in hand (viz. return
               home). Work schedule is tentatively to have
               something ready for IFIP 2.5 to look at their
               meeting in September.
     /Adams will email D. Muxworthy. UK will do the work.
               There will be an item selected for deletion,
               and at least one to be made obsolescent.
     /Lahey CPU time paper to be produced. Will ballot on
               network(s).
3.6  Interpretations Processing (July 15)
     212       /proc Hirchert/Hoffert
     Rolison:  too language lawyerly
     Lahey:    agree
     vote:     11-2 PASS

     218       /non-proc Kelble/Rolison
     Ellis:    reminded us of straw votes of yesterday.
               Massive indecision.
     Kelble:   keep name is "right thing"
     vote:     13-1, motion PASS

     220:      /non proc deferred until later

     221       /proc "The Big Edit" Hirchert/Ellis
     Hirchert: lots of host association problems. many edits
               refer to the same *words*. This will enable
               several outstanding interpretations to be
               resolved. Worked on (and presented) at the
               last meeting.
     Weaver:   why not subsume several interpretations into
               a single one? This is not considerate.
     Hirchert: pointers not in this proposal will be done
               later. /proc will take care of doing the
               work.
     Ellis:    do this first. fix the other items later.
               paper 185 last meeting identified related
               works.
     Weaver:   006 will not reflect all of this at the end
               of this meeting.
     Hirchert: can supply history list edits
     Lahey:    How does this relate to last meetings
               tutorial? misc: this is the same paper
               (modulo trivial fixups and reformatting) as
               last meeting.
     Maine:    refer to paper 93-185.
     Rolison:  Data entrees of a "type *name* ..." rather
               than "derived type" . Mover/ seconder
               accepted rewording.
     Motion    *PASSED* by unanimous consent.

     223       /non proc Martin/Rolison
     Martin:   identical to last meeting, but now with no
               edit.
     Rolison:  amend "cited constraint as cited text"
     Deferred until later.

     224, 225  /proc papers deferred

     227, 228, 215r2 chaotic discussion notetaker suffered

     *PASS* unanimous consent

     225       "use intrinsics" Ellis/Hoffert
     Weaver:   violent opposition. portability is seriously
               impacted. use statement is not a switch.
     Schonfelder: disagrees with Dick
     Maine:    reads conformance section
     Hoffert:  <manged> defines toggle.
     Maine:    what about real*8? namely could a USE
               "funny_math" module be defined to switch
               recognition of real*8? Likes a firm
               demarcation.
     Schonfelder: interfaces - implementations using
               language still standard. Notes that portable
               and standard conforming are different.
     Weaver;   non-standard features involve a "contract"
               between the vendor and the customer that is
               outside the standard.
     7-4 motion *PASSES*
     Ellis:    more about this on the letter ballot, no
               doubt.

3.7  Response to B9 Item C7 (July 15)
     231       Martin/Ellis
     Adams:    "early" objection, the wording seems a bit
               arrogant. Others opined the wording was
               "kind".
     Weaver:   Someone to take action item to do an email
               posting.
     Rolison:  spelling employing UK or USA rules?
     Ellis:    intent to flag soon via email
     Misc:     wordsmithing attempts. Edited by Hoffert and
               accepted y mover and seconder.

         Martin:    We will make some editorial changes.
         Result:    MOTION WAS WITHDRAWN.
         Maine:     There are many places in the document
                    where "name" and "entity" are confused.
