Subject: Issue 57 : definition of 'implicit team synchronization'
Reference: J3/06-007


Discussion of issue 57 (page 339)

We agree that a wording change is needed. 


Edit to J3/06-007

[199:14-15] Replace the final paragraph of 8.5.3 by

   Execution of an OPEN statement with a TEAM= specifier, a CLOSE
   statement for a file that is open with a TEAM= specifier, or a CALL
   statement for a collective subroutine is interpreted as if an
   execution of a SYNC_TEAM statement for the team occurred at the
   beginning and end of execution of the statement. This is called
   <<implicit team synchronization>>.

Note to Editor: Index the defined term as {synchronization!implicit team}.
