Subject:   Clarify relationship of coarrays and intrinsic assignment
From:      Van Snyder & Malcolm Cohen
Date: 2015 August 04

1. Introduction
===============

The requirements and prohibitions governing intrinsic assignment, and
the relationships of polymorphism, allocatability, array shape, deferred
length parameters, coarrays, and coindexed objects therein, are
confusingly organised.

Reading the introductory sentence of 7.2.1.2p2 and the third item, one
has the nonsense phrase "... the variable each deferred length type
parameter...."

The third item of 7.2.1.2p2 applies to character variables because,
unlike item (8) in the list in 7.2.1.2p1, it is not limited to
derived-type variables, but this is contradicted by 7.2.1.3p10.
There appears to be no reason for 7.2.1.3p10 to be giving permission
to do what is already allowed by table 7.8, other than causing a
contradiction.  7.2.1.3p8 and p9 also use "may" when "might" would be
better, but do not in themselves cause a contradiction.


2. Edits to 15-007r1
====================

[157:14] 7.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, p1, item (3),
         "neither a coarray nor a coindexed object"
         ->"not a coarray".

[157:25] 7.2.1.2p2
         "If <variable> is a coindexed object, the variable"
         ->"If the variable in an intrinsic assignment statement is a
            coindexed object,".

[158:1] 7.2.1.2p2, first bullet
        "shall not" -> "the variable shall not",
[158:2] second bullet
        "shall not" -> "the variable shall not",
        delete "and" at the end of that line.
[158:2+] insert new bullet
         "the variable shall be conformable with the expression, and"
[158:3] final bullet,
        after "each deferred length type parameter"
        insert "of the variable".

[159:6,9,11] 7.2.1.3p8, p9, p10, "may"->"might" thrice.
