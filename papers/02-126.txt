All comments (unless otherwise noted) apply to the January 2002 PDF
version
of  007.

1)          Section 13, page 277, line 3.  Replace a tautology with
current
status.

Proposal:  Change "Intrinsic subroutines may be elemental" to "Some
intrinsic
subroutines are also elemental"

2)          Page 278:17, make the section title singular, there is only
one
bit model

Proposal:  278:17, change "models" to "model"

3)          Page 279:23-24  The sentence is awkward and doesn't use the
correct terms.  I think the trailing "them" dangles.

Proposal:  Change 279:23-24 "The numeric manipulation and inquiry
functions
provide values related to the parameters and other constants related to
them."
To  "The floating-point manipulation functions (13.5.10) and numeric
inquiry
functions (13.5.6) the values of the parameters and other values related
to
the models."

4)          Page 280, note 13.6.  The last line of the example shows
more
than what it is intending to show and is confusing.

Proposal:  In note 13.6 Change CMPLX(Y=B, KIND=M, X=A) to
CMPLX((X=A, Y=B, KIND=M)

5)          Page 280, note 13.7  The description of BACK is untrue
(or misleading)  I'd read "indicate" to mean if it is present then the
scan is backwards.  But, it's also got to be TRUE

Proposal.  Note 13.7 Change description of BACK to "Controls whether or
not a string scan is to be from right to left (backwards)"

6)          Page 282:15  We have a whole section of character functions,
LEN seems out of place here and should be with the other character
functions like LEN_TRIM.

Proposal  Move 282:15 to just before 281:17

7)          Page 282:13  BIT_SIZE should go with the other numeric
inquiries; it's quite a bit like DIGITS.

Proposal Move 282:13 to just before 281:41
