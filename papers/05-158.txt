Title: Negative zero

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: FCD 4.4.2, 04-216

Basic Functionality: 4.4.2 of the standard requires behavior concerning
signed real zeroes that is inconsistent with common expectations.  If
all  intrinsic functions are prohibited from recognizing the difference
between positive and negative zero, then the following results are
required (all of which, to meet common expectations should be different):

AIMAG((0.0, -0.0)) -> 0.0
CMPLX(-0.0, -0.0) -> (0.0, 0.0)
CONJG((0.0, -0.0)) -> (0.0, -0.0) !
DBLE(-0.0) -> 0.0d0
DPROD(0.0, -0.0) -> 0.0d0
MAX(-1.0, -0.0) -> 0.0
MIN(1.0, -0.0) -> 0.0
REAL(-0.0d0) -> 0.0
ASIN(-0.0) -> 0.0
ATAN(-0.0) -> 0.0
SIN(-0.0) -> 0.0
SINH(-0.0) -> 0.0
TAN(-0.0) -> 0.0
TANH(-0.0) -> 0.0
TRANSFER(-0.0, 0.0) -> 0.0
MERGE(-0.0, 1.0, .true.) -> 0.0

There are other cases that are also arguably controlled by the existing
constraint (in which -0.0 appears as a value inside an array argument,
for example).  None of the above results meet common expectations.

Rationale: Many existing implementations already ignore this
constraint.  To force them to conform would decrease their quality of
implementation.  Of those intrinsic functions relevant to this
constraint, all should distinguish positive from negative zero, rather
than being prohibited from doing so.

Estimated Impact: Little.  Simply eliminating the constraint will require
no changes to existing implementations.  Existing Fortran programs
already have to accomodate negative zeros as results from implementations
that violate the constraint. In future, people will more often want
behavior consistent with usual practice among the rest of the numerical
software community.  Eliminating the constraint will  permit
implementations to accomodate this trend.

Detailed Specification:

Do not require the sign of real zero to be ignored in actual arguments to
intrinsic functions.
