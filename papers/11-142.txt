Reference: N1838, 11-137


The Fortran standard does not currently have a concept of rank
polymorphism, and the TR needs it to forbid the following:

    INTERFACE gerbil
        SUBROUTINE unknown (arg)
            REAL :: arg
        END SUBROUTINE unknown
        SUBROUTINE inchoate (arg)
            REAL, DIMENSION(..) :: arg
        END SUBROUTINE inchoate
    END INTERFACE gerbil

I do not think that a NOTE is enough to forbid this.


Edits:
------

[4:5+] Add the following paragraph:

    "In a generic interface, an assumed-rank dummy argument is not
disinguishable on the basis of rank from a scalar or an array of any
rank."


Edits to the standard (N1826):
------------------------------

[Page 285] At the end of para. 2 of 12.4.3.4.5 "Restrictions on generic
declarations" (defn of TKR compatible), change:

    ", and both have the same rank"
to
    ", and both have the same rank or either is of assumed rank."
