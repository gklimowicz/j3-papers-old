Subject:    <action-stmt> syntax rule
References: 16-007r2

1. Introduction
---------------

C501 excludes <end-function-stmt>, <end-mp-subprogram-stmt>,
<end-program-stmt>, and <end-subroutine-stmt> from R509
<execution-part>, which eventually includes <action-stmt> in R1139
<if-stmt>. C1142 excludes them from <action-stmt>.

The only places where <execution-part> appears in a syntax rule (and
those statements are therefore excluded), those statements appear later
in the same syntax rule, after a <contains-part>.

The only place where <action-stmt> is part of a syntax term excludes
those statements.

The only place where these statements being part of <action-stmt> is
important is in the list of branch target.

It would be clearer not to have them listed as part of the <action-stmt>
syntax rule, and then have them excluded by constraints everywhere the
syntax rules would have them appear.
