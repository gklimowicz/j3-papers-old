1. Introduction
---------------

There is no clear and explicit specification whether the scale factor
established by a P edit descriptor in a parent data-transfer statement
persists into a child data transfer statement.

There is a statement in subclause 12.5.2 "Connection modes" that the
OPEN statement cannot specify the scale factor, and that it is
implicitly zero.

There are three possibilities:

1. It is "implicitly" zero at the beginning of execution of every
   data-transfer statement.

2. It is "implicitly" zero at the beginning of execution of every parent
   data-transfer statement, continues to have the value established by a
   P edit descriptor when execution of a child data-transfer statement
   begins execution, and any change established during a child
   data-transfer statement persists when control returns to the parent
   data-transfer statement.

3. It's processor dependent.

There are several things that might be done. No matter which (if any) is
done, the following would be helpful:

[260:24- 13.4 Interaction between input/output list and format, after
NOTE 4] Insert a note:

"NOTE
   Because reversion of format control does not affect changeable modes,
   the scale factor persists. Example: The following format
   specification
   
       10 FORMAT ( F10.6, 2P, F10.6 )

   with the output statement

          WRITE ( *, 10 ) 0.125, 0.125, 0.375, 0.375

   produces the following output:

          0.125000 12.500000
         37.500000 37.500000
"

2. First strategy
-----------------

Specify explicitly that the value of the scale factor is zero at the
beginning of execution of every data-transfer statement.

[218:1 12.5.2p3 Connection modes] Replace the paragraph:

  "The scale factor is not a changeable mode of a connection. It cannot
   be specified in an OPEN statement. It is a changeable mode that has
   effect during execution of a single formatted data-transfer
   statement. It can only be specified by a <k>P edit descriptor
   (13.8.5). It is implicitly zero at the beginning of execution of
   every formatted data-transfer statement."

[273:13 13.8.5p1 P editing] The scale factor is not a changeable mode of
a connection. In the first sentence, delete "for the connection". Insert
sentences between the first and second:

  "The scale factor is a changeable mode that has effect during
   execution of a single data-transfer statement. It is implicitly zero
   at the beginning of execution of every data-transfer statement. If it
   is changed by a <k>P edit descriptor, that value persists until
   completion of execution of that data-transfer statement, or until it
   is changed by a <k>P edit descriptor. The value in effect when a
   child data-transfer statement (12.6.4.8) completes execution does not
   affect the value in effect during execution of a parent data-transfer
   statement (12.6.4.8)."

[273:14+ 13.8.5p1 P editing] Insert a note:

"NOTE
   Changing the value of the scale factor during execution of a
   child data-transfer statement does not change the value in effect
   during execution of a parent data-transfer statement."

3. Second strategy
------------------

Specify explicitly that the scale factor is zero at the beginning of
execution of every parent data-transfer statement, continues to have the
value established by a kP edit descriptor when execution of a child
data-transfer statement begins execution, and any change established
during a child data-transfer statement persists when control returns to
the parent data-transfer statement.

[218:1 12.5.2p3 Connection modes] Replace the paragraph:

   "The scale factor is not a changeable mode of a connection. It cannot
   be specified in an OPEN statement. It is a changeable mode that has
   effect during execution of a single formatted data-transfer
   statement. It can only be specified by a <k>P edit descriptor
   (13.8.5). It is implicitly zero at the beginning of execution of
   every formatted parent data-transfer statement (12.6.4.8). The value
   established by a <k>P edit descriptor in a parent data-transfer
   statement is the value of the scale factor when execution of a child
   data-transfer statement (12.6.4.8) begins. If the value is changed
   during execution of a child data-transfer statement, that value
   persists when control returns to the parent data-transfer statement."

[273:13 13.8.5p1 P editing] The scale factor is not a changeable mode of
a connection. In the first sentence, delete "for the connection". Insert
sentences between the first and second:

  "The scale factor is a changeable mode that has effect during
   execution of a single data-transfer statement. It is implicitly zero
   at the beginning of execution of every parent data-transfer
   statement. If it is changed by a <k>P edit descriptor, that value
   persists until completion of execution of that data-transfer
   statement, or until it is changed by a <k>P edit descriptor. The
   value established by a <k>P edit descriptor in a parent data-transfer
   statement (12.6.4.8) is the value of the scale factor when execution
   of a child data-transfer statement begins. If the value is changed
   during execution of a child data-transfer statement (12.6.4.8), that
   value persists when control returns to the parent data-transfer
   statement."

[247:23+ R1231 <inquire-spec>] Insert an alternative

   "  <<or>> SCALE = <scalar-int-variable>"

[251:36+ after ROUND= specifier in the INQUIRE statement] insert a
subclause

"12.10.2.27a SCALE= specifier in the INQUIRE statement

If the INQUIRE statement is executed while a parent data-transfer
statement (12.6.4.8) is in execution, the value of the
<scalar-int-variable> is the current value of the scale factor (13.8.5).
Otherwise, the value is zero."

4. Third strategy
-----------------

[218:1 12.5.2p3 Connection modes] Replace the paragraph:

   "The scale factor is not a changeable mode of a connection. It cannot
   be specified in an OPEN statement. It is a changeable mode that has
   effect during execution of a single formatted data-transfer
   statement. It can only be specified by a <k>P edit descriptor
   (13.8.5). It is implicitly zero at the beginning of execution of
   every formatted parent data-transfer statement.  Whether the value is
   zero at the beginning of execution of a child data-transfer
   statement, or the value established during execution of a parent
   data-transfer statement, is processor dependent. Whether the value
   established during execution of a child data-transfer statement
   persists as the value when control returns to the parent
   data-transfer statement is processor dependent."


[273:13 13.8.5p1 P editing] The scale factor is not a changeable mode of
a connection. In the first sentence, delete "for the connection". Insert
sentences between the first and second:

  "The scale factor is a changeable mode that has effect during
   execution of a single data-transfer statement. It is implicitly zero
   at the beginning of execution of every parent data-transfer
   statement. If it is changed by a <k>P edit descriptor, that value
   persists until completion of execution of that data-transfer
   statement, or until it is changed by a <k>P edit descriptor. Whether
   the value established by a <k>P edit descriptor in a parent
   data-transfer statement is the value of the scale factor when
   execution of a child data-transfer statement begins is processor
   dependent. If the value is changed during execution of a child
   data-transfer statement, whether that value persists when control
   returns to the parent data-transfer statement is processor
   dependent."

[247:23+ R1231 <inquire-spec>] Insert an alternative

   "  <<or>> SCALE = <scalar-int-variable>"

[251:36+ after ROUND= specifier in the INQUIRE statement] insert a
subclause

"12.10.2.27a SCALE= specifier in the INQUIRE statement

If the INQUIRE statement is executed while a parent data-transfer
statement (12.6.4.8) is in execution, the value of the
<scalar-int-variable> is the current value of the scale factor (13.8.5).
Otherwise, the value is zero."

[520:20+ A.2 Processor dependencies] Insert list items

"  o whether the value of the scale factor (13.8.5) at the beginning of
     execution of a child data-transfer statement (12.6.4.8) is zero or
     is the value established during execution of the parent
     data-transfer statement;

   o whether the value of the scale factor (13.8.5) when control returns
     from a child data-transfer statement (12.6.4.8) to a parent
     data-transfer statement is the value in effect when the child
     data-transfer statement began, or is the value in effect when the
     child data-transfer statement completed execution;
