Date:        June 10, 1996
To:          X3J3
From:        Richard Maine
Subject:     Edits made to X3J3/96-007


The following edits were made relative to X3J3/96-007 (N1176) to produce
X3J3/96-007R1, which has been sent to WG5 for "minor editing" prior to
its being passed to ISO for DIS balloting.

Changed headings and title page to reflect R1.  Other title page changes.

Page 52:7, first para of 5.1.1.7.  "providing" -> "provided".  Grammar.

Page 61, in section 5.2.10, changed 504 to 5.1 in the line following R532.
This was another artifact of the incorrect xref entry (see page 305 edit).

Page 169.  Added a - to the output for the -.5 example in note 10.12.
The omission of this - was a typo.  The SS does not suppress - signs,
and the same example in f90 shows the -.

192:5+ "its arguments" changed to "its dummy arguments" for consistency.

199:41 Next to last line of note 12.15.  "providing" -> "provided".  Grammar.

202:6 Second para of 12.4.1.2, "of listed" -> "listed".  Typo.

202:7 Second para of 12.4.1.2, "the dummy" -> "dummy". Typo.

Page 215 Added ", INTENT (IN)" to the declarations of the 3 dummy arguments
in note 12.36.  Explicit intent specification is required for
dummy arguments of elemental procedures.

232:13 First line in description of associated.  After "indicates", added
" whether or not".  Former wording doesn't really make sense.  The new
version is closer to the style used elsewhere, like in allocated.

232:39 In section on ASSOCIATED, case v.  "POINTER" -> "pointer".

256:7 In section 13.14.47, result value section, second line of case ii,
added the missing ")" to "LEN (STRING".

On page 262, moved lines 8-24 ("The pseudorandom number generator....
X2 equals X1") to follow line 45.  This moved it from the section
on random_number to the section on random_seed.  It was supposed to
go in random_seed inthe first place, but had been inserted in the
wrong section.

Page 305, line 30, changed R504 to R512.  This xref had been entered
into Frame a way that didn't correctly track the citation.
