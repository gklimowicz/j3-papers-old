OpenACC Liaison Report
======================

Information about OpenACC, including the current standard document,
training materials, and upcoming events can be found at
http://www.openacc.org/.

The current OpenACC standard is version 3.1. Version 3.1 of the OpenACC
specification was adopted November 2020.  The specification can be found
at https://www.openacc.org/specification. A notable feature of this
release is a definition for interactions with DO CONCURRENT when used
within OpenACC compute regions.

A new version of the specification is expected to be released in November
2021 and is expected to be called 3.2. This version is mostly an
organizational update, but has some user-facing changes. The most notable
change is an Error Handler API for registering custom error handlers
and cleanly shutting down the application.

News
-----
Progress continues on upstreaming support for OpenACC into the
LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project through the CLACC and FLACC
projects. More information on this compiler is available at the OpenACC
website, https://www.openacc.org/. A monthly call on this effort takes
place the first Thursday of every month and is open to anyone.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced at the OpenACC Summit in September
that their Cray Compilation Environment will be updated to support
OpenACC 3.0 in their Fortran compiler. This support is targeted for
public release in early 2022.

Applications
-------------
There are over 250 applications in production or development using
OpenACC, including:
 - Code LEO (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
 - NekCEM (Computational Electromagnetics)
 - INCOMP3d (3D incompressible Navier-Stokes solver)
 - Cloverleaf
 - MAESTRO and CASTRO (modeling stellar  explosions)
 - LSDalton (quantum chemistry)
 - SPECFEM-X (Geophysics)
 -  GTS (Fusion)
 And the usual suspects:
 - Gaussian 16
 - ANSYS Fluent
 - VASP 6
 - MPAS-A
 - COSMO
 - GAMERA for GPU
 - Quantum Espresso

More information on these can be found on the OpenACC
web site at https://www.openacc.org/success-stories.

Hackathons
----------
Since our last report (https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/21/21-160.txt),
there have been 9 OpenACC hackathons. These included events at NASA and
NOAA that included several important Fortran applications. Event dates
are posted at https://www.gpuhackathons.org/events. It is not a
requirement to use OpenACC directives to participate in these hackathons.

Community Engagement
--------------------
The OpenACC organization held its annual summit in September, which
included talks from various users and implementers. More than 600 people
signed up to attend the summit and more than 350 attended the event
live. All talks were recorded.

The OpenACC community slack is open to anyone interested and currently
supports a community of nearly 2700 members.
