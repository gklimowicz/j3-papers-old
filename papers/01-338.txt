[348:22-35] describes IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG. The FLAG argument is
specified as a scalar. However, the example uses IEEE_ALL
as an argument to IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG. IEEE_ALL is an array.

It is believed that the ability to specify FLAG as an array
is useful (in order to be able to inquire about the support
of all FLAGS with one invocation).
It is not sufficient to make IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG elemental,
since then the optional second argument X would affect the
shape of the result.

Edits:

[348:26] insert 'or a rank-1 array' after 'shall be scalar'.
Change 'Its value shall be' to 'The value of the scalar,
or the value of each array element, shall be'

[348:30] Change 'Default logical scalar' to 'The result is of
type default logical. It is scalar if FLAG is scalar, and
has the same shape as FLAG if FLAG is an array.'

[348:31:33] Replace with:
Result value:

Case (i):
The result of IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG(FLAG[,X]) when FLAG is scalar
has the value true if the processor supports detection of the
specified exception for all reals (X absent) or for real variables
of the same kind type parameters as X; otherwise it has the value false.

Case (ii):
The values of the elements of the result of
IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG(FLAG[,X]), if any, are the same
as would have been obtained if IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG,
with any optional X argument, had been applied
separately to corresponding elements of FLAG.
