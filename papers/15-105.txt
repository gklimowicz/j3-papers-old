NUMBER: F08/0127
TITLE: May an initial line begin with a semicolon?
KEYWORDS: Semicolon
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The Introduction to ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010, page xvi, states
  "A line in the program is permitted to begin
   with a semicolon."

Therefore, do the following 3 lines constitute a valid program.
;PROGRAM bad
PRINT *,'No'
END PROGRAM

ANSWER:

No, the example is not a valid program as it does not satisfy the
syntax rules and constraints.  As stated in 3.3.2.5 and 3.3.3.4, a
semicolon may be used to terminate a statement.  That is not the
case in the example, since there is no statement before the semicolon.

The semicolon does not appear anywhere else in the Fortran syntax and
therefore the example does not conform.

An edit is supplied to the Introduction to clarify the change in
Fortran 2008.

EDITS:

[xvi] Change "A line in the program" to "A continuation line".
