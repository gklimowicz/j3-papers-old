NUMBER: F08/0084
TITLE: Pointer arguments to PURE functions
KEYWORDS: PURE function, POINTER, INTENT(IN)
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

 Consider the following subprogram:

   Real Pure Function F( X )
     Real,Pointer :: X
     Real :: F
     f = 1.0
     x = 2.0    ! (A)
     Nullify(x) ! (B)
   End Function F

 This subprogram does not conform to Fortran 2003, because both
 statements (A) and (B) violate constraint C1272 which says
   "C1272 In a pure any designator with a base object that ...
          is a dummy argument of a pure function ... shall not
          be used ... [in] a variable definition context ...".

However, the corresponding constraint in Fortran 2008, C1283, is
missing the condition that applies the constraint to a dummy
argument of a pure function, except when has INTENT(IN).  Thus
the statements marked (A) and (B) do not violate C1283, and
therefore this subprogram appears to conform to Fortran 2008.

Was this subprogram intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this subprogram was not intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to re-insert the omitted condition.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

[312:31] In 12.7, constraint C1283, after "association",
         insert ", is a dummy argument of a pure function".
