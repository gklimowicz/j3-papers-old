All comments (unless otherwise noted) apply to the January 2002 PDF
version of  007 viewed on a CRT.

1)          Page 47, note 4.24, second line.  There should be a
reference
to 4.23 before the :

2)          Many of the boxes don't have one or more missing lines
around
them.  See for example Note 12.38 (misslin left line), Notes 12.26 and
12.37 (missing left and top line).  But Notes 12.50 and 12.51 look OK.

3)          Page 304, note 13.11 hosed up.

4)          Some things don't have an underscore in the TEXT version,
e.g
30    13.7.16          BIT SIZE (I)
on page 291

5)          Page 279:13.  There appears to be an extra space after "The"
in "The  model"

6)          Page 279:19-20     Change the "I" in emIn to lower case,
twice

7)          Page 304, the example, e.g. line 6.  The character used for
character delimination appears to be two characters on my screen.  A cut
and paste gives  >>``<<  which is two grace accents on my keyboard.
This
may just be a latex problem; but they don't look like the apostrophy or
quote described in section 3.

8)          Page 304:11.  There is an "}" after PROGRAM ECHO

9)          13.7.71 and 13.7.76 header lines need a comma before kind
in  [, MASK,KIND]  3 places.  I'd also fix 309:9 as I think most other
function references have a space between arguments.
