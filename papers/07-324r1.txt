Discussion

The editor is correct to point out that the text is a relic from the
past when units were treated as global across all images. An edit is
supplied to correct this. Another edit is needed in 2.4.2.

The editor asks "what is the connect team for an unconnected unit?".
9.10.2.32 tells us that it is empty, but this should be stated in the
main section on connect teams. An edit is supplied.

It is intended that if the file or unit in an OPEN statement is
connected and the connect team has more than one image, the connect
team is required not to change. An edit for 9.5.6.1 makes this clear.

There is a problem with preconnection. Apart from default input, any
preconnected unit has a connect team of all the images. This
means that before a unit is opened for team i/o, it has to be closed
(on all images, with synchronization). This seems very unfriendly.
We think it would be better for a preconnected unit to have a connect
team of one image and be preconnected to different files on different
images. Edits are supplied to effect this. If the user wants a bigger
connect team, an explicit open may be employed.

Edits to 07-007r3

[31:12] In 2.4.2 Program execution, para. 1, sentence 2, after
"data objects" add ", units,".

[209:12]. In 9.3.2 File existence, at the end of the final paragraph,
add a new sentence: "Its name shall differ from that of any
preconnected file on any other image".

[215:5] In 9.5.1 Referring to a file, at the end of para. 3, delete
", and on all images".

[217:16-19] In 9.5.6.1 General, replace para. 4 by:
    "If the file to be connected is not the same as the file to which
     the unit is connected, the effect is as if a CLOSE statement
     without a STATUS= specifier had been executed for the unit
     immediately prior to the execution of an OPEN statement. If the
     previous connect team (9.5.6.19) is of more than one image, the
     new connect team shall be the same."

[222:14-17]. In 9.5.6.19 TEAM= specifed in the OPEN statement, replace
the final paragraph by two paragraphs:

    "A unit that is neither connected nor preconnected has an empty
     connect team.

     A preconnected unit has a connect team consisting of the executing
     image. The unit identified by the value INPUT_UNIT in the intrinsic
     module_ISO_FORTRAN ENV is preconnected on image 1 and is not
     preconnected on other images."
