Subject: Data recommendations on Containers

Reference: 18-122r1, 18-110r1, 18-123

A poll among the committee members resulted in a request for
containers in standard Fortran.

Data subgroup believes that it would be better to have standard features
in Fortran that will allow developers to create general or
specific container objects.

It would be better to concentrate on the features of generic programming
rather than an implementation of containers.
