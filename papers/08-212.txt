Hi, Soma,

I apologize.  I should have sent this to you too.

Subject: J3 attendance - HP's membership is in jeopardy

Hi, Shivarama,

HP has not attended the past two J3 meetings, #183 and #184.  INCITS
rules say that if a member misses 3 out of 4 consecutive meetings,
he/she loses membership.

HP’s membership is currently in jeopardy.  HP must send a
representative to the next J3 meeting, #185, in Las Vegas, Nevada,
USA, August 11 - 15, 2008, in order to retain membership on J3.

HP’s membership will still be in jeopardy after meeting #185.  HP
must also attend J3 meeting #186 in Tokyo, Japan, November 16 - 21,
2008, to no longer be in jeopardy.

Thank you

/Stan Whitlock
 J3 secretary
