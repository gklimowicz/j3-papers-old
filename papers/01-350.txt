Subject:  Fix up Intro (again)

This paper is to fix up some commentary in the Introduction
as promised during 158, but not then done due to time constraints
and the number of papers passed (i.e., more important things).

Specifically, the description of inheritance & extends/extensible
is very awkward.  Better language should be provided.  This is
an attempt to do so.

EDITS

xiv: 15-16 Replace
"support: ... used),"

with
"support: extensible and extends in the definition of derived types
(which provide inheritance),"
