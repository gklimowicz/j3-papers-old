Subject: C13 - UTI 66 : LOGICAL
Date:    28-jul-2006

---------------------

Unresolved Technical Issue 66 (page 400) notes that the result of a
bits to logical conversion may not be a valid logical value and that
the words in the current text do not adequately address this. It is
suggested that language more like that of TRANSFER (which has to deal
with the same issue) should be used here.

The objective is to avoid referring to the result of a bits to logical
conversion as a logical "value".

Edits:
------

[399:28] In Result Value Case (ii), replace "the result has the value
whose physical representation is the same as the rightmost" with "the
physical representation of the result is the same as the rightmost".

[399:31,33] In Result Value Case (iii), delete "value" twice.

[399:33+] After the Result Value section of LOGICAL, add a Note:

Note 13.17a
The result of a bits to logical conversion may be used in a context
requiring a logical value only if the physical representation of the
result is valid as a logical value.
