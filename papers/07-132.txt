Subject: UTI 96: co-indexed actual arguments
References: J3/07-007

Discussion

In a subsection on allocatable and pointer dummy variables, [318:7-8] 
states: 

"If the actual argument is a co-indexed object, the dummy argument shall
 have the INTENT(IN) attribute."
 
UTI 96 (page 318) says that this is in the interests of preventing remote
allocation/deallocation or remote pointer assignment.

We agree.
