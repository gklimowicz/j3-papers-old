The item in the list of exclusions in 1.1p4 concerning physical properties
of the representation of quantities and the method of rounding,
approximating, etc. is a half truth, now that we have Clause 14.

Editor:

At the end of [1:35] insert "except by reference to the IEEE International
Standard {1.2p9} under conditions specified in Clause 14"
