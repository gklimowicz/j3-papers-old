Subject: UK-02 default accessibility of entities
Date: 2013 October 17

Reference: N1975, N1982

1. Specification

a. In a module, the default accessibility of entities from another module
   accessed by use association should be decoupled from the default
   accessibility of entities defined by the using module.

b. This should be done by a separate statement, not on the USE statement,
   to avoid confusion when multiple USE statements for a module appear.

c. Multiple specifications of the default accessibility shall not be
   permitted.

d. Specification of accessibility shall not be permitted for a module that
   is not referenced by a USE statement.

2. Syntax

a. Permit a module name to appear in a PUBLIC or PRIVATE statement.

b. At most one appearance of a module name in all the PUBLIC and PRIVATE
   statements in a module specification part is permitted.

3. Edits to 10-007r1

[intro] Update the new feature list
  "In a module, the default accessibility of entities accessed from
   another module can be controlled separately from that of entities
   declared in the using module."

[102:27] "<use-name>" -> "<access-name>".
{Remove useless sharing of term with the USE statement.}

[102:31] "<use-name>" -> "<access-name>",
         "named variable" -> "module, variable".
{Remove useless sharing etc.  Replace unnecessary verbiage with
 the extra syntax.}

[102:32+] add two constraints
  "C563a A module whose name appears in an <access-stmt> shall be
         referenced by a USE statement in the scoping unit that contains
         the <access-stmt>.
   C563b The name of a module shall appear at most once in all the
         <<access-stmt>>s appearing in a module."
{Required constraints, worded so as not to require a syntax rule ref.}

[102:34] after "in the list" insert
  "that is not a module name.  Appearance of a module name in an
  <access-stmt> specifies the default accessibility of entities accessed
  from that module.".
{Remove modules from receiving the attribute, add sentence for semantics.}

[103:3-] At the end of 5.4.1, insert new note

  "NOTE 5.26a
   The following is an example of using an accessibility statement on a
   module name.

   MODULE m2
     USE m1
     ! We want to use the types and procedures in m1, but we only want to
     ! re-export m_type and our own procedures.
     PRIVATE m1
     PUBLIC m_type
     ... definitions for our own entities and module procedures.
   END MODULE"
