NUMBER: F08/0112
TITLE: STAT= and ERRMSG= in ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE
KEYWORDS: STAT=, ERRMSG=, ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

  CHARACTER(80) text(0:100), msg
  INTEGER stat,istat(0:80)
  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:),y(:,:)
  ...
  ALLOCATE(x(10),STAT=stat,ERRMSG=text(stat)) ! A
  DEALLOCATE(x,STAT=stat,ERRMSG=text(stat))   ! B
  msg = ''
  ALLOCATE(y(999999,999999),STAT=istat(LEN_TRIM(msg)),ERRMSG=msg) ! C
  msg = ''
  DEALLOCATE(x,STAT=istat(LEN_TRIM(msg)),ERRMSG=msg) ! D

In each of the statements labelled A-D, there is a dependency between
the STAT= specifier and the ERRMSG= specifier (from STAT= to ERRMSG=
in A and B, and from ERRMSG= to STAT in C and D).  There appears to be
no prohibition against this (though there are many prohibitions
against other dependencies in ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE).

Are all these examples conforming, and if so, is the dependent
variable referenced with the value of the other variable at the
beginning of execution of the statement or at the end of execution of
the statement?

ANSWER:

These are not standard-conforming, as no interpretation is established
for them.  An edit is supplied to clarify this prohibition.

EDITS:

[132:4] 6.7.4 STAT= specifier, p1, append
  "The <stat-variable> shall not depend on the value of the
   <errmsg-variable>.".

[132:22] 6.7.5 ERRMSG= specifier, p1, append
  "The <errmsg-variable> shall not depend on the value of the
   <stat-variable>.".
