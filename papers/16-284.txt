----------

While the current text for EX editing (13.7.2.3.6) says "The scale
factor has no effect on output.", the text for P editing (13.8.5)
omits mention of the EX edit descriptor and thus leaves unspecified
the effect of a scale factor on input using an EX edit descriptor.

Note that such input is handled as if the F edit descriptor had been
used, and that hexadecimal-significand input always has an exponent so
is excluded from having a scale factor applied. However, a decimal
value would be valid for EX input and therefore the text needs to
include EX.
