Discussion:

Comment GB20 noted an incorrect article in the CFI_is_contiguous dv
parameter description, and proposed allowing a scalar objects. This
does not match the Description paragraph, nor the Fortran
IS_CONTIGUOUS function. There was objection to returning false for a
scalar being contiguous, so the compromise disallows them.  Edits
provided.


Edits to N1869:

In 5.3.5.6 in the description of the dv formal parameter to
CFI_is_contiguous, change "the object." to "an array. The base_addr
member of the C descriptor shall not be a null pointer."
{First edit makes it parallel to the Description (and IS_CONTIGUOUS in
Fortran). Added sentence disallows unallocated allocatable and
disassociated pointers.}

In 5.3.5.6,  Result Value paragraph, change "object" to "array".
