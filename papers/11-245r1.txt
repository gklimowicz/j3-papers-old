Reference: WG5/N1869, WG5/N1882

The third comment from DIN assumes that 29113 provides support for
interoperability of fixed-length allocatable or pointer variables.

That assumption is false (see fourth paragraph of subclause 5.3.8 of
29113):

   "If a dummy argument in an interoperable interface is of type
   CHARACTER and is allocatable or a pointer, its character length
   shall be deferred."

Consequently, Reinhold Bader, speaking for DIN, withdrew comment 3 in
the DIN ballot on WG5/N1869.

PL22.3 concurs.
