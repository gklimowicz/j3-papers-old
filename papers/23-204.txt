Introduction:
-------------

In order to help plenary more fully understand the design and
implications of the templates feature that the generics subgroup
has been working on and is proposing, we have prepared and presented
multiple presentations on the topic. The slides for these presentations
can be found in the Meeting Files in the folder
Tutorials/GenericsTutorialsJune2023.
