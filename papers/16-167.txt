Subject:   unallocated allocatable actual and nonallocatable optional dummy
Date: 2016 February 10
References: 16-007

DISCUSSION:

16-007 states that an unallocated allocatable data object shall
not be passed as an actual argument corresponding to a nonallocatable
dummy argument as in 16-007:

  [133: 11-13] 6.7.1.3

  "It shall not be supplied as an actual argument corresponding
   to a nonallocatable dummy argument, except to certain intrinsic
   inquiry functions."

Apparently such a data object can be passed as an actual argument
corresponding to a nonallocatable but optional dummy argument since
F2008.

Edit to 16-007:

[133:12] 6.7.1.3
After "nonallocatable", add " and nonoptional".

=== End ======
