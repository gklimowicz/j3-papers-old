ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5 N1203





US National Activity Report

WG5 meeting, July 1996





Since the last WG5 meeting (November 1995), the US Fortran standards

committee, X3J3, has met three times - November 1995, February 1996, and May

1996.  During these meetings the input for Corrigenda 3 and the Fortran 95 DIS

were completed as per WG5 requests.





Fortran 2000 requirements and priorities.  The US recommends that the Fortran

2000 requirements and their priorities be as described in document X3J3/96-115r2.

These requirements and priorities are reproduced here.  Note that 16 items in

this list are new US recommendations, identified since the last WG5 meeting;

note also that three items in WG5-N1155 (B10, B20, B23) are not included in this

list (see below).

	allow MERGE in constant expressions	71 (new US recommendation)

	named scratch files				73 (new US recommendation)

	passing specific/generic names		59 (new US recommendation)


The highest priority items should be firm requirements for Fortran 2000.

Medium and low priority items may "miss the train" if the schedule does not

permit their completion after integration of the technical reports and the highest

priority items into the draft standard document.  The US proposes that the

"minor technical enhancements" category contain small "stand-alone" items

that X3J3 may do, not do, add to, etc., according to the availability of resources.



The US recommends that WG5 withdraw three items from its preliminary list of

Fortran 2000 requirements (WG5-N1155).  These three items are:



WG5 number	Requirement title					Reason

42 (N1155/B23)	internal procedures as actual arguments		cost high, need low

48 (N1155/B20)	variable format specifiers			specs contentious,

need low

53 (N1155/B10)	private/shared data in parallel processes	cost very high, need

not clear



Finally, the US recommends that none of the Fortran 95 obsolescent features be

deleted in Fortran 2000.





Liaison reports, US recommendations.  Since the last WG5 meeting X3J3 has at

each of its meetings reviewed the status of each of the three technical reports

(TRs), the proposed TR on parameterized derived types (PDT), and the project on

conditional compilation; a liaison report documenting each such review has

been approved, sent to the corresponding project editor, and copied to WG5.



At this point the US believes that the floating point exception handling TR is

time critical, essentially complete, and has adequate consensus; therefore the US
supports moving this TR to the CD stage.



The allocatable components TR, while not time critical, is also essentially

complete, with adequate consensus except for the provisions for automatic

reallocation; the US supports moving this TR to the CD stage if the suggested

modifications are made regarding automatic reallocation.



The C interoperability TR, while time critical, appears not to be as far along and

does not have adequate consensus on its technical content; accordingly the US

does not support moving this TR to the next stage of ISO processing.



The proposed parameterized derived type TR is essentially complete, but there is

not yet adequate consensus on its technical contents.  Because of this, and the

belief that they are not time critical and interact with many other parts of the

language, the US does not support making parameterized derived types into a

TR.



The US supports continuing with the separate conditional compilation part of

the Fortran standard, but does not have a strong preference at this time as to

which alternative approach is chosen.





Fortran 77.  At its May 1996 meeting X3J3 voted unanimously, without

discussion, to reaffirm its earlier recommendation that the ANSI Fortran 77

standard be withdrawn and to approve responses to the comments associated

with the public review that occurred over a year ago.
