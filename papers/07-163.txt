Subject: CAF examples of STOP and ALL STOP
Date: 2007 February 07
References: 07-007, 07-155

I think we should add examples of using STOP and ALL STOP to terminate
some or all of the images. I propose the examples below as a starting
point, to be incorporated in Notes as seen needed:

----------------------
! Example of ALL STOP:
ALLOCATE(WORK_ARRAY, STAT=STATUS)
IF(STATUS/=0) ALL STOP ! Terminate all images ASAP

----------------------
! Example of STOP:

TYPE(IMAGE_TEAM) :: MY_TEAM
REAL, DIMENSION(100)[*] :: X=0.0
REAL, DIMENSION(100) :: DX

INTEGER :: ITERATION, LOCAL_STAT, SYNC_STAT
CHARACTER(LEN=1024) :: MESSAGE
LOGICAL :: TEAM_CONVERGED=.FALSE.

! Iterative algorithm where a local error may occur on some images
! The images are partitioned among several teams
DO ITERATION=1,100

   ! Calculate DX, setting LOCAL_STAT>0 an error occurs
   IF(LOCAL_STAT>0) STOP ! Initiate normal termination
     ! This may free non-coarray memory and CPU cycles to the OS
   ! Note that such a STOP may occur inside a third-party library
   ! It may also be due to the execution of exit() in a C subprogram

   ! Coordinate with the rest of the team:
   SYNC TEAM(MY_TEAM, STAT=SYNC_STAT)
   IF(SYNC_STAT==SYNC_STOPPED_IMAGE) THEN
      ! We cannot continue without our team
      ! Write data to a file, including X on other images of the team
      STOP
   ELSE IF(SYNC_STAT/=0) THEN
      WRITE(*,*) "SYNC TEAM ERROR ON ",THIS_IMAGE(), " MSG=",
      TRIM(MESSAGE)
      ! Save some debugging/restart local data to a file
      ! An unrecoverable image/network failure may have occurred
      ! rendering co-array data unaccessible
      STOP
   END IF
   ! Check for convergence of X and set the flag TEAM_CONVERGED
   IF(TEAM_CONVERGED) THEN ! All images have the same convergence flag
      ! Process the final X
      STOP ! Stop updating X
   END IF
   ! Continue with calculating DX locally and update X:
   X=X+DX

   ! Now coordinate all the teams together:
   SYNC ALL(STAT=SYNC_STAT, ERRMSG=MESSAGE)
   IF(SYNC_STAT==SYNC_STOPPED_IMAGE) THEN
      ! Some other images/teams have stopped already
      EXIT ! Stop the iteration
   ELSE IF(SYNC_STAT/=0) THEN
      WRITE(*,*) "SYNC ALL ERROR ON ",THIS_IMAGE(), " MSG=",
      TRIM(MESSAGE)
      ! Save some debugging/restart local data to a file
      STOP
   END IF
   ! Exchange data with the other teams as necessary

END DO

! The team this image belongs to may continue working
! and continue to use X from all images, or stop altogether
