Subject: Fortran 2015 proposal for G0.d edit specifier
Date: August 20, 2013
References: 13-244r1

Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~

At meeting 201 in Delft, June 2013, the following proposal
from paper 13-244r1 was accepted for inclusion in Fortran
2015:

---
The g0 edit descriptor had a ".d" added in response
to public comments as a part of Fortran 2008.  The requirement
is that ".d" be absent when the list item is not real or complex
should be eliminated to make it optional and/or ignored when
the list item is not real or complex.  A specific behavior should
be selected for interpretation of ".d" when used with g0
and the list item is of type integer, logical, or character.
---

This paper supplies the edits to specify that the .d is ignored 
when the list item type is integer, logical or character.
