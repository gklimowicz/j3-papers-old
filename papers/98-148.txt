TITLE: Result of NULL intrinsic associated with CHARACTER(*) dummy argument
KEYWORDS: NULL intrinsic, assumed character length parameter,
          argument association, pointer association

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: Consider the following program.

      PROGRAM P
        CALL SUB(NULL())
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE SUB(C)
          CHARACTER(*), POINTER :: C

          PRINT *, LEN(C)
        END SUBROUTINE SUB
      END PROGRAM P

According to 7.1.4.1 [91:27-30], "The data type, type parameters and rank
of the result of the intrinsic function NULL when it appears without an
argument are determined by the pointer that becomes associated with the
result.  See Table 7.2."  In this case, the pointer that becomes associated
with the result is the corresponding dummy argument when the result appears
as an actual argument.

However, according to 5.1.1.5 [51:14-18], a dummy argument of type character,
with a character length parameter of *, "assumes the length of the
associated actual argument when the procedure is invoked."

Is this a standard conforming program?  If so, how is the length of C
determined, and what should be the output of this program?
