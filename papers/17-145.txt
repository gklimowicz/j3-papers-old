Subject: IEEE_MODES_TYPE defined in wrong intrinsic module
Date: 2017 April 03


Discussion:

Section 17.2 Derived types, constants, and operators defined in modules
paragraph 2 states the module IEEE_EXCEPTIONS defines the derived type
IEEE_MODES_TYPE.  All examples in the document that reference this derived
type USE IEEE_ARITHMETIC, not IEEE_EXCEPTIONS.

Paper J3/14-196r1 introduces contains specifications and syntax for
conformance with ISO/IEC/IEEE/60559:2011.  The syntax for feature (u)
specifies a new data type in IEEE_ARITHMETIC called IEEE_MODES_TYPE.
In paper J3/14-198r1, the edit:

  [406:27+] 14.2 Derived types and constants defined in the modules, p2
  Add new bullet:
    "-IEEE_MODES_TYPE is for representing the floating point m odes."

mistakenly places this bullet in the list of data types defined in the
IEEE_EXCEPTIONS module, not the IEEE_ARITHMETIC module.


Edits:
17.2 Derived types, constants and operators defined in the modules p2
[448:18] Delete "IEEE_MODES_TYPE is for representing the floating point
         modes."

17.2 Derived types, constants and operators defined in the modules p3
[448:29+] Add new bullet "IEEE_MODES_TYPE is for representing the floating
          point modes."
