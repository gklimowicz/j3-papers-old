Subject:    Problem with TARGET, dummy arguments, undefinition

1. Introduction
===============

Suppose one has

  type :: T
    real, allocatable :: C1(:)
    real, pointer :: P2(:,:)
  end type T

  subroutine S ( A, I, J )
    type(t), intent(out), target :: A
    allocate ( a%c1(i*j)
    a%p2(1:i,1:j) => a%c1
  end subroutine S

Since we haven't provided the TARGET attribute for components, this
requires the effective argument to have the TARGET attribute, else the
association status of the P2 component becomes undefined when S returns.

This is absurd.

I hope we don't need to go to WG5 to get permission to repair this
oversight.

Maybe it needs an interp.

", unless the pointer and target are components of the same derived-type
dummy argument".
