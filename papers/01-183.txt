Issue 245 (page 361)

This issue notes that we need to indicate that an entity of type C_PTR
becomes undefined when an object which it is associated with reaches
the end of its lifetime.

Edit: [360:35] add

    A variable of type C_PTR which is associated with a variable which
    becomes undefined by the execution of a RETURN or END statement
    also becomes undefined upon execution of the RETURN or END statement.

Edit: [361:35-39] replace J3 internal note with

    17) The execution of a DEALLOCATE statement causes a variable
        of type C_PTR to become undefined if the variable is associated
        with a target or allocatable array that is deallocated.

Issue 217 (page 387):

The issue questions the usefulness of multiple negative values for
the C kind type parameters for floating point data types defined in
the ISO_C_BINDING module.  Negative values indicate that no
corresponding Fortran kind type exists for the C type.  Original spec
and syntax provided only for a single negative value (-1) in the case
where there was not Fortran kind which was equivalent to the C type.
The additional values were added at the suggestion of full committee
we make no change at this time and delete the unresolved issue.

Edit: [387:38-44] delete
