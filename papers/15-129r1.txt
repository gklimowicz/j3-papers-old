Discussion
----------

In his recent ballot (see N2045) Malcolm Cohen wrote

"(d) FAIL IMAGE is insufficiently specified.
- The syntax is "FAIL IMAGE <stop-code>".  I see no purpose in using the
<stop-code> BNF rule here."

We propose removal of the optional stop-code. If the program wishes to
write a message he/she can do this with a write statement ahead of the
FAIL IMAGE statement.

In his recent ballot (see N2045) Malcolm Cohen also wrote

"I think it would be clearer to state explicitly that image termination
is not initiated by this statement, e.g.

  " Neither normal nor error termination is initiated, but no further
statements are executed by that image."

An edit is provided for this.
