Subject:    Initial undefinition of variables

1. Introduction
===============

It is not obvious what "initially" means in 16.6.4, which says that
variables that are not initially defined are initially undefined.  Does
"initially" mean "when the program begins execution" or "when the
program, a subprogram, or a BLOCK construct begins execution?"  The
latter seems a bit weird, because local variables of a subprogram or
BLOCK construct that have the SAVE attribute but not initialization are
"initially" undefined but if they are assigned a variable and then if
the subprogram or BLOCK construct is executed again, they are not
"initially" undefined.

This should be described in 16.6.6 "Events that cause variables to
become undefined".  If it is described elsewhere, that other place is
the wrong place, and that description can be deleted.

========

[520:12+ 16.6.6p1(1-)] Insert a list item:

"  (0)  When a subprogram or BLOCK construct begins execution, local
        variables that do not have the SAVE attribute become undefined."
