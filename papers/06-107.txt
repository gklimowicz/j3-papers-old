NUMBER: F03/0076
TITLE: Scope of Fortran names of procedures with binding labels
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, dummy procedures
DEFECT TYPE: CLARIFICATION/ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following conforming:

module A
   interface
      subroutine CProc() bind(C,name="AnExternalCProcedure")
      end subroutine
   end interface   
end module

module B
   interface
      subroutine CSub() bind(C,name="AnExternalCProcedure")
      end subroutine
   end interface   
end module

ANSWER:

The standard's current wording is such that his is not conforming. The
name of an external procedure is a global entity and it is unique to a
given procedure. That is, the external C procedure AnExternalCProcedure,
must be given a unique Fortran name inside a Fortran program.

However, the question is whether this was intended or whether it
happened by virtue of improper integration of binding labels (which
should be global entities, rather than the Fortran name) with the
existing words for Fortran external procedures (which have only one
name, the Fortran name, and therefore it should be global). Forbidding
examples like tone one above violate basic principles of modularity and
introduce global entities without justification. The Fortran names given
to the external C procedure AnExternalCProcedure should be local to the
scopes of modules A and B respectively, not of global scope. 

Correcting this problem may be done in the next revision of the
standard, if it is deemed that the answer to this Interp ought to be
yes.
