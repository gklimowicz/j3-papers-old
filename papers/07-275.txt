NUMBER: F03/0101
TITLE: Is UDDTIO output suitable for namelist and list-director input
KEYWORDS:
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:

The first paragraph of 10.9.2 says that the form of the values produced by
list-directed output is the same as that required for input.  It also says
values are separated blanks or commas, etc.

The first paragraph of 10.10.2 has similar words for namelist output.  It
also requires that the variable name be produced in upper case and that
the output consist of name-value pairs.

Is it intended that output produced by used defined derived type routines
conform to these rules?

ANSWER:

No, it was not intended to constrain the user derived type output values.
There should be an exception similar to the one for adjacent undelimited
character values.  User derived type output fields do not need to be
readable by either namelist nor list-directed input
