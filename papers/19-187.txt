Subject: Request for interpretation: REDUCE in constant expressions
Date: 2019-July-29


1. Introduction
The OPERATION argument of the REDUCE intrinsic function is permitted
to be a user defined function that meets the specified requirements.
A constant expression is an expression that can be used as an
initializer, in declaring a named constant, or as a kind type
parameter. Constant expressions in previous revisions of the
standard could be evaluated at compile time.

There is no restriction preventing the use of the REDUCE intrinsic
function in a constant expression. The lack of this restriction
permit expressions that result in invocation of user functions in
constant expressions.

2. Interpretation Request

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F18/xxx
TITLE: REDUCE intrinsic in constant expressions
KEYWORDS: REDUCE, constant expression
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Submitted

Section 10.1.2 Constant expression states:

 "A constant expression is an expression with limitations that make
  it suitable for use as a kind type parameter, initializer, or
  named constant.  It is an expression in which each operation is
  intrinsic, and each primary is
  ...
  (6) a reference to a standard intrinsic function that is trans-
      formatoinal other than COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, GET_TEAM, NULL,
      NUM_IMAGES, TEAM_NUMBER, THIS_IMAGE, or TRANSFER, where each
      argument is a constant expression."

Question:

REDUCE is a transformation function that can invoke a user function.
Was it intended that REDUCE be allowed in a constant expression?

Answer:

No, it was an oversight to allow REDUCE in a constant expression.
An edit is provided to fix this oversight.

Edit:

[158:32]
  after "NUM_IMAGES,"
  insert " REDUCE,"
  to make the entire list item read
  "(6) a reference to a standard intrinsic function that is trans-
       formational, other than COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, GET_TEAM,
       NULL, NUM_IMAGES, REDUCE, TEAM_NUMBER, THIS_IMAGE, or
       TRANSFER, where each argument is a constant expression."
