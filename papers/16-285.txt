1. Introduction
===============

Interp F08/0013 introduced text that is in 7.5.6.3p1 "When finalization
occurs": "If the variable is an allocated allocatable variable that
would be deallocated by intrinsic assignment, the finalization occurs
before the deallocation."

This overlooked allocated allocatable ultimate components.

Finalization of an allocatable subobject during intrinsic assignment
needs to be clarified.

2. Edits to 16-007r2
====================

[84:28 7.5.6.3p1 "When finalization occurs"] After "variable" insert ",
or a subobject thereof,".

[84:32 7.5.6.3p2 "When finalization occurs"] Replace "component" with
"subobject".
