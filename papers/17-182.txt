1. Opening of the Meeting: 9:00 am, June 26, 2017
    ** /WG5 **
WG5:2. Opening business
    2.1 Introductory remarks from the Convener
        The convenor welcomed participants, especially those who were
        attending WG5 for the first time.  He noted that this was the
        eighteenth, and last, occasion on which he and Dan Nagle would
        jointly chair a Fortran standards meeting.

    2.2 Welcome from the Host
        Reinhold Bader welcomed participants on behalf of DIN
        and the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre.

    2.3 Local arrangements
        Reinhold Bader described local arrangements and invited
        participants to dinner at the Neuwirt restaurant on the Wednesday
        evening.  There were to be two guided tours of local facilities
        after the close of the meeting on the Tuesday and Thursday
        evenings.

    2.4 Appointments for this meeting
        The drafting committee would be Reinhold Bader, Daniel Chen,
        Toon Moene, David Muxworthy (chair), Jon Steidel and Masayuki
        Takata. David Muxworthy would act as secretary and John Reid as
        librarian and as editor of the Disposition of Comments document
        in response to the CD ballot.

    2.5 Adoption of the Agenda
        The agenda was adopted.

WG5:3. Matters arising from the Minutes of the Boulder 2016 Meetin
            [N2109]
    There were no items not otherwise on the agenda.

WG5:4. Status of Boulder 2016 Resolutions [N2108]
    With regard to resolution B4 and the strategic plan for WG5 (N2016)
    the convenor said it would be necessary during the meeting to decide
    whether or not to produce a second CD.  In either case the ultimate
    publication date of July 2018 would be met.

WG5:5. Reports
    5.1 SC22 Matters (Convener)
        John Reid reminded members that he was resigning as WG5 convenor
        at the SC22 plenary meeting in August 2017.  There would also be
        a change in the SC22 convenorship with David Keaton from the USA,
        taking over at that meeting.  A new requirement by JTC1, that all
        participants in working group meetings formally register with ISO
        (v. SC22N5210) was considered inappropriate for this group.
        The group's standpoint was to be as inclusive as possible and not
        to exclude those who might contribute to the work.  This matter
        would be taken up at the SC22 plenary meeting.

    5.2 National Activity Reports
        Canada: The most recent SCC (Standard Council of Canada) quarterly
                meeting was in early June.  The committee draft of the
                next Fortran standard was approved.
        Germany: Reinhold Bader was now formally a DIN committee member
                and attended one DIN meeting per year.  He was the only
                active member for Fortran in Germany, other members
                having ceased Fortran activity.
        Japan:  The Fortran working group had eight members and met 5-6
                times a year, face to face. The translation work for
                F2008 had not proceeded enough for publication by the
                end of its life. Japan voted for the CD ballot with some
                editorial comments. A WG5 meeting in Tokyo meeting was
                planned for 2019.
        Netherlands: The Programming Languages Committee of NEN had
                ceased to function.  It was not clear whether it had been
                formally disbanded.  Toon Moene continued as an
                individual expert member of WG5.
        UK:     A report was in N2128.
        USA:    The main activity was that of PL22.3, meeting twice to
                work on the DIS.


    5.3 Report from Primary Development Body (INCITS/PL22.3 Chair)
        PL22.3 was charged with developing the draft standard and had
        done so.

    5.4 Reports from other Development Bodies (Editors/Heads)
        There were currently no contributing development bodies.

    5.5 Liaison Reports:
         INCITS/J11 (C): Dan Nagle
            C had not been followed in detail since the Cplex project
            terminated.
         MPI: Bill Long
          - The fault tolerance proposal was still in limbo.
            Enough cases were discussed during the December meeting to
            challenge the ULFM proposal and the working group was
            instructed to go back and work on them again.
          - The next major item for consideration was MPI Sessions.
         UPC: Damian Rouson
            Not present, and no report this meeting.
         IFIP/WG2.5: Van Snyder
            A meeting had been proposed for this summer but would not
            take place.
         OpenMP: Bill Long
          - There was a week-long face to face meeting last month,
            where progress was made on various topics. OpenMP 5.0 was
            still on track to be released at SC'18. For this year's SC,
            a "beta" preview draft of OpenMP 5.0 (TR6) would be released.
            The two major new features that were expected for TR6 were
            memory directives and accompanying runtime APIs, and OMPD
            (an interface for third-party debuggers and the OpenMP
            implementation). There were also some additional tasking
            features that were expected to be introduced, some
            clarifications on the use of Fortran allocatables/pointers
            with devices, and probably some language to account for
            "newer" C++ features (e.g. lambdas).
          - The memory directives would include the directives described
            in the released TR5 document, and the API would probably also
            define some predefined allocators for memories optimized for
            various attributes (e.g. bandwidth-optimized)
         WG9 (Ada): Van Snyder
            WG9 and Ada Europe had a joint meeting in conjunction with a
            conference on software reliability, in Vienna, during the
            week of 16 June.  Van Snyder was requested to ask Randy
            Brukardt or Erhard Plodereder if WG9 has prepared separate
            WG23 annexes for Ada as a whole, and SPARK, the high-
            reliability subset of Ada.
         WG23 (Vulnerabilities): Dan Nagle
          - There was a WG23 meeting the previous week where work
            continued on the base document 24772-1.  Work would resume
            on the Fortran annex (24772-8) when time was available.
            Members of WG5 were asked to volunteer to help the progress
            the Fortran part of 24772.
          - Cplex had completed its contribution and their document
            had gone to WG23 for inclusion in the C part.
         OpenACC:  Gary Klimowicz
             OpenACC 2.6 is hoping to complete sometime in 2017.
             Proposed features include:
           -  Manual Deep Copy: a relatively minor change to the data
              clause behavior that would allow a user to perform a manual
              deep copy. OpenACC is continuing to investigate true deep
              copy, but are looking for a prototype implementation before
              proposing adoption.
           -  A serial compute construct for use between parallel compute
              constructs that helps avoid unnecessary data movement.
           -  Query routines that allow the application to detect
              available devices and properties of the devices.
           -  Support for an error callback routine so an application can
              gracefully exit if there is a fatal error in device code.
           -  An if and if_present clause on the host_data construct
              to direct calls to either host addresses or device
              addresses, depending on where the data resides.
           -  A no_data clause on compute constructs that would behave
              like present-or-don't-create.
           -  Data clause modifiers, such as copyin(readonly:x) that
              should allow for more aggressive code optimization.

            OpenACC anticipates a minor release 8-12 months following 2.6
            where they hope to address deferred topics:
           -  Partially shared memory
           -  Reductions across multiple loops
           -  Asynchronous data constructs and the "present" table
           -  Reductions as a data clause
           -  Several others
            More information is available at
              http://www.openacc-standard.org/.

            The current version of the proposed specification can be
            found at OpenACC 2.6 Specification Update (June 2017)
            (https://www.openacc.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/
               OpenACC_2pt6_Specification_Update_ISC17.pdf).

--- NB
    From this point the detailed review of the draft of the revised
     standard proceeded throughout the meeting in PL22.3 mode, addressing
     agenda items WG5:6 and WG5:7.

WG5:6. Consideration of the comments from the ballot of the CD revision
   of the Fortran standard and construction of responses.

WG5:7. Construction of edits to the CD revision of the Fortran standard
   to correspond to the CD ballot responses and any other changes deemed
   desirable.

**/WG5**
    There was a discussion with Damian Rouson on detailed arrangements
    for the 2018 WG5 meeting.  Richard Gerber had been co-opted as
    co-host; the meeting would be held at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory;
    it would be possible to stay in LBL Guest House but it was too
    early to reserve this accommodation.  A file giving further
    information was available on the meeting website and was subsequently
    allotted number N2136.

    The reunion meeting for former Fortran committee members was being
    organized separately.

   There was a discussion on the first draft of the revised Strategic
   Plan for WG5.  The essential choice was whether or not to produce
   a second CD.  In either case final publication of the standard was
   expected to be earlier than the present forecast date of July 2018.
   It was decided that the window for further technical changes had
   closed and that the draft standard at the end of the meeting should
   be the DIS, not a second CD.

   There was a review of the first draft of a Disposition of Comments
   document to respond to the CD ballot.  Minor edits were suggested.

**/WG5**

    It was suggested that the outline schedule for the reunion meeting in
    June 2018 could be:
     Saturday evening: dinner
     Sunday morning:   presentation(s)
     Sunday afternoon: expedition, possibly to Alcatraz
     Sunday evening:   dinner

    There was a review of the latest draft of the resolutions.  Minor
    edits were proposed.

    Under agenda item 10 there was an hour-long discussion on the
    criteria to be used in planning the next revision of the Fortran
    standard.  This was in the context of the revised Strategic Plan
    being developed at the meeting and the discussion paper N2126
    (A Strategy for Reckoning the Content of the Next Revision).
    The debate was chaired by Steve Lionel as in-coming WG5 convenor.
    There was general concern that the standard had moved ahead of the
    language in compilers available to users, giving the impression that
    Fortran was slowing down.  Moreover different compilers implemented
    different subsets of the standard, thus inhibiting both development
    and portability of programs.

    There was a need to investigate what Fortran users wanted to do in
    the language which was not currently possible and to find out what
    features in other languages were actually used, not simply talked
    about.  Fortran was said to be the only language which built
    interoperability into its standard.  New features should be adopted
    only if they had long-term viability and features which might have
    only a minor benefit for users but a negative effect on compiler
    construction or performance should be avoided.  The debate was
    adjourned, to be continued the following day.

    Steve Lionel thanked John Reid for helping with ISO procedures with
    regard to the change of convenorship.

    The meeting adjourned at 4:35 and was followed by the meeting social
    event at the Gasthof Neuwirt in Garching.  Entertainment there was
    provided by "Classic goes Bluegrass" with the host as lead fiddle.

   Updated drafts of the resolutions and the Strategic Plan were examined
   and minor changes suggested.  Members were asked to check the latest
   version of the Disposition of Comments document and to report any
   errors to the convenor.

   The convenor's report to SC22 was discussed and minor edits were
   suggested.

      now attained voting rights.

      Gary Klimowicz is now the respresentative for NVIDIA and Mark LeAir
      is the alternate.  Bob Scollard is no longer with the company.

      The alternate to Bill Long has retired; a new alternate will be
      appointed later.

4.7 Comments from members

    Dan Nagle: INCITS needs to approve the appointment of a new
    Treasurer. Need signature card for the bank account. We need to have
    someone starting at the October meeting.

    Malcolm Cohen will make N2134 = DIS today.  We will have a 17-007r2
    later that includes line numbers.  DIS has no blue for hyperlinks,
    and no line numbers.


This concluded the PL22.3 business for meeting 213, and PL22.3 was
adjourned at 9:55.

** /WG5 **

WG5:8. Consider the Fortran defect reports (interpretations) in J3/17-006.
    There were no interpretations required/requested this meeting.

   A subgroup of three, Bill Long, Dan Nagle and John Reid, was appointed
   to check that the edits arising from this meeting were incorporated
   correctly into the proposed DIS (N2134).  The Project Editor advised
   that hyperlinks in the document would be black, that is
   indistinguishable from normal text, and that the DIS would not have
   line numbers.

WG5:9. WG5 Business and Strategic Plans
    9.1 Goals for 2017-2020
WG5:10. Start planning for the further revision of the Fortran standard.

   The discussion on planning the next revision of the Fortran standard
   resumed, again chaired by Steve Lionel.  Scheduling was debated,
   resulting in edits to the Strategic Plan.  It was agreed that a web
   survey of users would be instituted, organized by Steve Lionel.  The
   suggestions would first be processed by PL22.3 at its October
   meeting. The survey would be closed prior to the February 2018 PL22.3
   meeting and further processing done at that time. At the June 2018 WG5
   meeting a first cut at a work plan would be produced.

WG5:11. Closing Business
    11.1 Future meetings
       As discussed in the PL22.3 meeting

    11.2 Any other business
       No other business was raised.

WG5:12. Adoption of Resolutions [N2131]
   Resolutions G1 to G5 and G10 to G12 were approved by unanimous acclaim
   and resolutions G6 to G9 were approved by unanimous consent.
   Responding to resolution G1 John Reid, the retiring convenor, said he
   had much enjoyed working with WG5 members over the years, thanked them
   for the support they had given him and said that he proposed to
   continue working with Fortran as an ordinary WG5 member.

WG5:13. Adjournment
   The WG5 meeting adjourned at 12:15 on Thursday, June 29, 2017 and was
   followed by tours of the LRZ computing facilities conducted by Volker
   Weinberg and Reinhold Bader.
