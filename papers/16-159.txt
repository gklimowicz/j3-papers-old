Subject:   Edit: Accessibility of a parent component

QUESTION:

There has been discussions via email about when a parent component is
accessible.

The standard states that the parent component has the accessibility
of the parent type as follows: [p80: 2-6]

  "An extended type has a scalar, nonpointer, nonallocatable, parent
   component with the type and type parameters of the parent type.
   The name of this component is the parent type name. It has the
   accessibility of the parent type. Components of the parent
   component are inheritance associated (16.5.4) with the
   corresponding components inherited from the parent type. An
   ancestor component of a type is the parent component of the type
   or an ancestor component of the parent component."

Is the accessibility of the parent type mentioned in the above
referring to the scoping unit in which the parent type is declared
or the scoping unit where the parent component is referenced?

Consider the following two programs:

A.

Is the following program standard comforming?

  Module A
    private
    Type A_t
      Integer i
    End type
    Public A_t
  End module

  Module B
    Use A
    private
    Type, extends(A_t) :: B_t
    End type
    Public B_t
  End module

  Module C
    Use B
    Type, extends(B_t) :: C_t
    End type
    Contains
      Subroutine sub(this)
        Type(C_t) :: this
        This%B_t%A_t%i = 4   !! 1. Is This%B_t%A_t%i accessible?
        This%B_t%i = 4       !! 2. Is This%B_t%i accessible?
      End
  End module

B.

  Module AB
    private
    Type A_t
      Integer i
    End type
    Type, extends(A_t) :: B_t
    End type
    Public B_t
  End module

  Module C
    Use AB
    Type, extends(B_t) :: C_t
    End type
    Contains
      Subroutine sub(this)
        Type(C_t) :: this
        This%B_t%A_t%i = 4   !! 1. Is This%B_t%A_t%i accessible?
        This%B_t%i = 4       !! 2. Is This%B_t%i accessible?
      End
  End module

ANSWER:

The intention of the standard is that a parent component has the
accessibility of the parent type in the scoping unit where it is
declared. Therefore,

Program A: 1 is accessible
           2 is accessible
Program B: 1 is not accessible
           2 is accessible

An edit is provided to clarify it.

EDITS to 16-007:

[80: 4] In 4.5.7.2 Inheritance, paragraph 2, after "type",
add "in the scoping unit where it is declared"
