Interp F03/0141 as balloted
---------------------------

Interp F03/0141 passed WG5 ballot with changes

Comments on the ballot were:

While I agree with the answer, I think the proposed edit is more confusing
than clarifying (a procedure name does not have an interface). I'd suggest
adding suitable text to 11.2.1 instead, perhaps something like

[252:24+] The interface of any local identifier of a procedure is that of
the procedure, except that its name is replaced by the local identifiers'
name.

On reflection, I agree with the comment that the edit
does not really make sense.  Here is an alternative edit:
[260:2] After "scoping unit" insert
  ", except that if the interface is accessed by use association,
   there may be more than one local name for the procedure".
{Yes, here we really do want "may", because we are giving permission.}
If it's not otherwise clear, we might want to also say
  "If a procedure is accessed by use association, each access shall be
   to the same procedure declaration or definition."

NUMBER: F03/0141
TITLE: More than one specific interface for a procedure
KEYWORDS: Specific interface
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider the example:

  module A
  contains
    subroutine S ( X )
      real :: X
    end subroutine S
  end module A
  module B
    use A, only: T => S
  end module B
  module C
    use A, only: U => S
  end module C
  program P
    use B ! Access the procedure name T
    use C ! Access the procedure name U
    ! T and U are different names for the same procedure.
  end program P

Is this program conforming?

The procedure S defined in the module A has two explicit specific
interfaces in program P.  The sixth paragraph after constraint C1211
in subclause 12.3.2.1 says "A procedure shall not have more than one
explicit specific interface in a given scoping unit."

ANSWER:

It was intended that this program be conforming.  An edit is provided
to correct this.

EDITS:

[260:2] After "scoping unit" insert
  ", except that if the interface is accessed by use association,
   there may be more than one local name for the procedure".
{Yes, here we really do want "may", because we are giving permission.}
Append a sentence at the end of the paragraph:
  "If a procedure is accessed by use association, each access shall be
   to the same procedure declaration or definition."
