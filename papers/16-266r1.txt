From:       Van Snyder & Steve Lionel
Subject:    Comments on Clause 13
References: 16-007r2
Date: 2016 October 11

1. Edits
--------

[277:7-8 13.7.2.3.8p2 Input/output rounding mode]
Replace "decimal value" with "decimal or hexadecimal value" twice.

[280:16 13.7.6p3 User-defined derived type editing]
Replace "that derived type" with "the derived type of
the item".

[281:6-7 13.8.1.2p1 T, TL and TR editing]
Replace "the left tab ... of that record" with
"character position one of that record becomes the left tab limit"
{because this is easier to parse (and shorter) than the existing
inside-out phrase}.

[289:29 13.11.3.3 Namelist input values]
Before the sentence beginning "Such a sequence", inset the
sentence "The delimiters may be apostrophes or quotes; the value of
the <DELIM= specifier>, if any, in the <OPEN statement> for an
<external file> is ignored."

[289:34+ NOTE 13.36 13.11.3.3 Namelist input values]
Delete the first and third sentences of this note, which read as
normative text; they have been inserted in the previous edit. The
note remains with the sentence "The delimiter is required..."

[290:2 13.11.3.4p1(3) Null vaues]
Insert "nonblank" before "value separator".

[291:21 13.11.4.3p3 Namelist output records]
Replace "will be produced by namelist formatting" with "is placed".

[291:23 13.11.4.3p3 Namelist output records]
Replace "is produced by namelist formatting" with "is placed in
the output record".

2. Optional edits at the editor's discretion
--------------------------------------------
[273:27 13.7.2.3.3p1 E and D editing]
[274:12 13.7.2.3.4p2 EN editing]
[275:8 13.7.2.3.5p2 ES editing]
Replace the comma before "otherwise" with a semicolon.

3. Rejected edits
-----------------

[267:20-21 C1306] Replace the constraint:

"C1306 (R1308) <w> shall be positive for L or A edit descriptors [and
may be positive or zero for all other edit descriptors]. {Because the
syntax for <w> doesn't allow a sign.
(This adds no value.)

[269:22-32 13.4p9] Replace "in a manner identical to the way it is
positioned when" with "as if by"; delete "is processed".  {Compare to
[278:35 13.7.4p5].}
(The text on 278 adds a much longer description of the process
that would be necessary to repeat here. The current wording is fine.)

[270:7-8 13.5p4] Replace "in a manner identical to the way it is
positioned when" with "as if by"; delete "is processed".  {Compare to
[278:35 13.7.4p5].}
(See above.)

[271:15+ 13.7.2.1p1(3)] Insert a note:

"NOTE 13.7a
   The effect of the scale factor is described in 13.8.5."
(Nowhere here is the scale factor even mentioned.)

[273:3 13.7.2.3.2p7 F editing]
Append a sentence: "The scale factor has no effect
on hexadecimal input editing." {If it's true.  It should also be stated
in 13.8.5.  Compare to [274:9 13.7.2.3.4p1].}
(This topic needs to be explored further - a separate paper will be
written for it.)

[276:2- NOTE 13.13+ ES edit descriptor]
Insert a note:

"NOTE 13.13a
  The effect of the ESw.dEe edit descriptor is the same as the effect of
  the 1PEw.dEe descriptors."
(While true, such a note doesn't add value.)

[276:10 13.7.2.3.6p2] Insert "decimal" before "digits".
(Unnecessary - this text is discussing the number of digits - what those
digits are is described in line 21.)

[277:25 13.7.2.4p1] Append a sentence "The scale factor has no effect on
B, O, or Z editing." {If it's true.}
(See edit for 273:3 above.)

[282:14 13.8.5p1] Insert "only" before "the editing done...".
(Unnecessary.)

[285:23 13.10.3.2p3] Replace "<do-variable> in the input list becomes"
with "<do-variable>s in the input list become" {because there might be
more than one of them}.
(The existing text already allows for that.)

[289:34+1-5 NOTE 13.36] The first and third sentences of NOTE 13.36
appear to be normative, and the first sentence is (improperly) written
as normative text.  Make the first and third sentences normative, in a
paragraph at [289:34+ 13.11.3.3p7+.  Leave the second sentence in the
note.
(Replaced with an edit in section 1.)

4. Questions and comments without edits
---------------------------------------

JOR did not investigate these questions.

[281:4-7 13.8.1.2p1] The relationship of the left tab limit to a data
transfer statement executed after a nonadvancing data transfer statement
to the same unit should be explicitly specified.  It shouldn't be
necessary to prove a theorem involving "immediately prior to nonchild
data transfer."

[282:13-30 13.8.5] The relationship of P editing to hexadecimal input
during F editing should be described here.  The relationship of P
editing to a data transfer statement executed after a nonadvancing data
transfer statement should be obvious here.  Something like "The value of
$k$ is zero at the beginning of execution of a [nonchild?] data transfer
statement."  If that's true.

[283:24-29 13.10.2p2] Can r be zero?

[285:24+1-6 NOTE 13.31] NOTE 13.31 is probably not precisely correct in
using the term "a list-directed input record" if list-directed input
occurs after a nonadvancing input statement.  Perhaps "all blanks
encountered during list-directed input" would be better.

[287:8-13 13.10.4p9-10] If character sequences are both preceded and
followed by value separators, null values would be produced. This
contradicts 13.10.4p12.

[287:18+1-2 NOTE 13.33] Is the length of a list-directed output record
bounded by the RECL= specification in the OPEN statement?

[287:29-38 13.11.2p2] More needs to be said about constraints and
restrictions on <designator>, especially concerning pointer and
allocatable components, whether a pointer component can appear after a
<part-ref> with nonzero rank, whether two <part-ref>s with nonzero rank
can appear, ....

[288:23-289:39 13.11.3.3] Subclause 13.11.3.3 could be substantially
shortened and simplified by reference to list-directed input.

[289:1 13.11.3.3p1] Can r be zero?

[290:2 13.11.3.4p1(3)] This appears to imply that input to an array A
using "A= ,10" specifies a value for A(3), i.e., there are two null
values.  The discussion of blanks as null values appears to contradict
subclause 13.11.3.5.

[291:12+1-2 NOTE 13.40] Is the length of a namelist output record
bounded by the RECL= specification in the OPEN statement?
