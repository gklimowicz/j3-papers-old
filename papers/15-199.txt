From: Van Snyder
Subject: Issues arising from editor's report for 15-007r1, 15-184
Date: 2015 August 05

In 15-184, the following edit was rejected:

REJECTED [64:29] 4.5.2.2 Accessibility, p1,
        insert after the first sentence:
          "An <access-spec> on the <derived-type-stmt> specifies the
           accessibility of the type name."
  This edit is wrong, since sentence 1 and the inserted sentence are partly
  contradictory.
ACTION: Try again to work out how this should be done.  Either completely
        reword the first sentence, or better, insert the second sentence
        into 5.5.2 so it does not contradict 5.5.2.

[94:9] 5.5.2 Accessibility attribute, p2,
       Before "Identifiers for which an <access-spec> is not..." insert

  "An <access-spec> in a type declaration statement specifies the
   accessibility of all the entities declared by that statement.  An
   <access-spec> in a <derived-type-stmt> specifies the acccessibility of
   the derived type name.  Accessibility can also be specified by an
   <accessibility-stmt>."
