This is a response to 06-339r1,
which was a reworking of paper 06-278 which was deferred from meeting 177.

Q. [42:7+ note 4.1, last sentence]
   Are (type bound?) generics resolvable at compile time?

A. Yes.  They are resolved to specific type-bound procedures.

---
Q. [42:20-22] Add UDDTIO to the list. It can change the parameters

A. No.  UDDTIO is merely syntax for a procedure reference.  The only
   changes it can make are via the already-listed mechanisms.

---
Q. Back in the good old days, an elemental function was pure, so it wasn't
   needed in the list at [50:27]. Now, we have IMPURE elemental functions.

A. Agreed.

EDIT. [50:27] Add "elemental," to the list.

---
Q. [61:23 and 30] I believe C449 and C453 are incorrect, but
   I don't understand what they are trying to do.

A. This is addressed by UTI 094.
   Answering UTI 094 is beyond the scope of this paper.

---
Q. [63:note 4.33 end] Can UDDTIO also determine the shape?

A. Only via one of the already-listed mechanisms.
   UDDTIO is just a procedure reference.

---
Q. [64:22] Should C461 be worded similar to C449? It seems to be
   about the same things.

A. No.  C461 is about the situation where an initialisation expr
   is required.  C449 is (a) incorrect, and (b) about the other cases.
