Discussion
----------

This paper contains notes regarding the edit activity resulting in the
creation of the TS 18508 drafts J3/14-130 and WG5/N2007.  The edits
are based on WG5/N1996.

Papers used as edit sources for Part I are:

14-102r2
14-104r2
14-105r3
14-107r2
14-110r1

14-113r1

Part I also includes additional edits needed for proper integration of
the paper edits (denoted as "New") and has modifications of some edits
to correct errors of editorial scope (denoted as "Modified").

Technical repairs are documented in Part II.


Part I: Edits in papers passed at J3 meeting 203 and editorial repairs
======================================================================

TS Introduction
---------------

[iv:p4] New. {Additional edit: Add at the end of Introduction, para 4,
the Corrigendum 2 reference. Matches edit [1:3] below. Result is that
the TS is upward compatible with F2008 + Corrigendum 2.}


TS Clause 1 Scope
-----------------

[1:3] Done. {14-107r2}


TS Clause 3 Terms and definitions
---------------------------------

[5:13] New. {Additional edit: Replace the definition of current team
with "the team specified in the CHANGE TEAM statement of the innermost
executing CHANGE TEAM construct, or the initial team if no CHANGE TEAM
construct is active".  This then matches the changes in The
corresponding text defining "current team" 5.1.}

[5:25+] New. {Additional edit: Add a definition for "failed image".
Copy text from 5.8.}


TS Clause 5 Teams
-----------------

[9:3-4] Done. {14-112r2}

[9:4-6] Done. {14-110r1}

[9:5] Not done. {14-112r2} {The edited sentence was replaced by
14-110r1.}

[9:15+] New and Modified. {Additional required edit: The definition of
"established" has to appear in the normative text of the TS.  Just
adding it to the Edits in Clause 8 is not sufficient.  Adding the text
from 14-110r1 edit [28:25+] here. Also, modified to make needed
technical repairs. See Part II below.}

[9:18-19] New. {Additional edit: In the fourth sentence of 5.2
TEAM_TYPE, delete "that includes the executing team". The changes in
14-113r1 allow assignment of team variables, so is it now possible to
have a scalar variable of type TEAM_TYPE that is accessible (in a
module, for example) that is not part of the current team family
tree.}

[9:22-23] Done. {14-113r1}

[9:24-33] Done. {14-113r1}

[9:34] Done. {14-113r1 and 14-112r2 - duplicated edit.}

[10:5+] Modified. {14-110r1} {Moved new constraint to [10:16+] to be
in order with the existing ones, and added a reference back to the
rule, following the pattern of the existing constraints.}

[10:17] Done. {14-112r2}

[10:17-18] New. {Additional edit: In C508 the reference for TEAM_TYPE
is "defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module".  This is not
consistent style in C604 which uses a subclause reference. LOCK_TYPE
in 10-007r1 also uses a subclause reference. To be consistent, change
"defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module" to "(5.2)".}

[10:18+] New. {Additional edit: Add a needed constraint as follows:
"C506a (R502) No <coselector-name> shall appear more than once in a
<change-team-stmt>."}

[10:18+] Done {14-110r1}

[10:20] Done. {14-113r1}

[10:20] Done. {14-112r2}

[10:21] Done. {14-113r1}

[10:21] Done. {14-113r1}

[10:22-23] Done. {14-113r1}

[10:23+] Modified {14-110r1} {Following the three references added "of
ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010" since these are references to the base standard
and not parts of the TS. Also deleted the text about changing final
upper bounds. See Part II for additional edits.}

[10:28] New. {After the first sentence add a sentence to require that
the whole set of images in the team execute the same CHANGE TEAM
statement: "All nonfailed images of the team containing the executing
image that is identified by <team-variable> shall execute the same
CHANGE TEAM statement."}

[10:38] Done. {14-110r1}

[10:38+] Done. {14-110r1}

[11:1-7] Modified {14-110r1} {Replaced "<team_id>" with "team
identifier" which was defined in 5.1. Changed "with the value" to
"with a value" because there might be more than one ancestor
team. Finally, the wording of the second sentence seems vague. Clearer
to explicitly separate the effect of changing a team (changing the
local image index and number of images) and what cosubscripts do
(determine an image index).  Replaced the second sentence with "The
coarray shall be established in that team or an ancestor of that team
and the cosubscripts determine an image index in that team." At the
end of the second paragraph, add a similar establishment requirement:
"The coarray shall be established in an ancestor of the current team
and the cosubscripts determine an image index in the team identified
by TEAM_ID."}

[11:1-4] Not done. {14-112r2} {The whole paragraph was replaced by
14-110r1.}

[11:7+] Modified. {14-110r1} {The stated edits did not match the text
at the beginning of the Note. Made the array A uniformly the one in
the initial team and B the associated one in the CHANGE TEAM
block. Change the comments "Iterate" and "Halo exchange" to "Iterate
within team" and "Halo exchange across team boundary" to clarify that
the halo exchange illustrated does not include halo exchanges between
images within a team.}

[11:7+2] Done. {14-112r2}

[11:7+22] Done. {14-112r2}

[11:8-] Done. {14-112r2}

[11:15-16] Done. {14-112r2}

[11:15, 12:1-2, 12:3-6] Done. {14-112r2}

[12:6+] Modified. {14-112r2} {Changed the text to be replaced to
"coarrays regarded as".}

[12:10-11] Modified. {14-113r1} {The second sentence in this edit
technically omits the initial team, which has a value for any of its
team variables initially defined rather than by executing FORM
TEAM. Appended to the new sentence: "or shall be the values of the
team variables for the initial team".}

[12:17-] Done. {14-102r2}

[12:18-19] Done. {14-112r2}

[12:23] New. {Additional edit: Change "definitions of variables fail
when that variable" to "definitions of a variable on the image fail
when that variable". The current text has a plural/singular mismatch,
and is not clear that the variables involved are on the failed image.}

[12:24] Done. {14-112r2}

[13:2+] Done. {14-112r2}


TS Clause 6 Events
------------------

[15:8-9] Done. {14-104r2}

[15:8-9] New. {After the edit above from 14-104r2, append the sentence
at [30:3-4]. The sentence in 8.7 that edits 8.5.2 paragraph 3 to
exempt changes to event variables from segment rules, similar to
atomics, is normative and should appear in cause 6 of the TS where
event variables are introduced. The text at [33:11] is amended to
remove the new sentence, which is already added to the base standard
in 8.5.2.}

[15:24] Done. {14-104r2}

[15:26-27] Done. {14-104r2}

[15:29] Done. {14-104r2}

[15:30-33] Done. {14-104r2}

[15:34] Modified. {14-112r2} {Minor wording change of "an" to
"another" before the second EVENT POST, to improve clarity.}

[16:3] Done. {14-104r2}

[16:5-7] Done. {14-104r2}

[16:8-10] Done. {14-104r2}

[16:14-19] Done. {14-104r2}


TS Clause 7 Intrinsic procedures
--------------------------------

[17:8] Done. {14-112r2}

[17:9] New. {Additional required edit: In 7.1p2 include MOVE_ALLOC
(added to the TS by 14-107r2) to the list of current intrinsics
modified by the TS, ordering the list to be alphabetical.}

[17:12-16] New. {Insert better wording for consistency of atomic
operations.  In 7.2 delete the fourth sentence (ordering in unordered
segments is processor dependent) and replace the second sentence with:

"The effect of executing atomic subroutines in unordered segments on a
single atomic object is as if the subroutines were executed in some
processor-dependent serial order, with none of the accesses to that
object in any one subroutine execution interleaving with those in any
other."}

[17:16] New. {While the assignment of the value to OLD is not part of
the atomic operation, the determination of that value IS part of the
atomic operation. Add that the sentence.}


[17:22] New. {Additional edit: In 7.3p1, first sentence, add
"nonfailed" before " image of the current team" to be consistent with
the rest of the paragraph.}

[17:28] Done. {14-112r2}

[18:19], [19:6], [19:37], [20:10] Done. {14-112r2}

[19:27] Done. {14-112r2}

[23:34] Done. {14-112r2}

[23:36+] Done. {14-112r2}

[23:40] Done. {14-104r2}

[23:40-41] New. {Additional edit: Move "to EVENT[2]" earlier in
sentence, after "posts" to improve readability.}

[24:1] Done. {14-111r2}

[24:3+] Modified. {14-111r2} {The second sentence of the edit, "If
TEAM is present..." belongs at the beginning of the Result Value
paragraph. Moved.}

[24:4-6] Done. {14-111r2}

[24:9] Done. {14-111r2}

[24:10] Done. {14-111r2}

[24:19-20] Done. {14-112r2} {Edit actually on line 19 only.}

[24:34 - 25:7] New. {Replace the SUBROUTINE TT example to GET_TEAM
with a new one that is more clear about which teams are in effect.}

[26:10+] Modified. {14-107r2} {The reference (8.5.2) is to the base
standard, so added that qualification in the text.}

[26:27] Done. {14-112r2}


TS Clause 8 Required editorial changes
--------------------------------------

[27:24] New. {Additional required edit: At the end of the last
additional facility list entry, append "and simulate failure of an
image". Need to update the list to include the FAIL IMAGE statement
introduced by 14-102r2.}

[27:30+] New. {Additional edit: Replicate the new definition of
"failed image" at [5:25+] with subclause numbers changed.}

[28:3] New. {Replace the definition of "current team" with the new
definition at [5:13].}

[28:22+] New. {Additional edit: Add new construct and statements into
the syntax list in 2.1 High level syntax as follows: In R213
<executable-construct> insert alphabetically
"<change-team-construct>"; in R214 <action-stmt> insert alphabetically
"<event-post-stmt>", "<event-wait-stmt>", "<fail-image-stmt>",
"<form-team-stmt>", and "<sync-team-stmt>".}

[28:23] New. {Additional required edit: Modify the first edit to move
only the first 3 paragraphs of 5.1. The new paragraph 4 in 5.1 should
be moved to  2.4.7 instead. See [9:15+] above.}

[28:23] New. {Additional edit: Change the beginning of the edit
instructions to place the new text after paragraph 1 if 2.3.4, instead
of "At the end", to keep the Notes in 2.3.4 at the end of the
subclause.}

[28:25+] Modified. {14-110r1, first edit} {Instead of inserting the
paragraph in the Clause 8, insert ad edit with instructions to move
5.1 para 4 to 2.4.7 since the text from 14-110r1 is now duplicated in
5.1. See [9:15+] above.}

[28:25+] Modified. {14-110r1} {second and third edits, modified to
\uwave form, and made into separate edits.}

[28:25+] Modified. {14-110r1} {final edit, modified to \uwave form.}

[28:31] New. {Additional required edit: The new constraint and the
changes made to R624 at [10:38] and [10:38+] by 14-110r1 need to be
replicated in Clause 8, replacing the existing edit at [28:31].}

[28:32-34] New. {Additional required edit: Modify the instructions for
moving the text in 5.4 to the base standard to account for new changes
in 5.4 - two paragraphs starting after C508 instead of one starting
after R624, and removing the reference to GET_TEAM.}

[29:24] Done. {14-112r2}

[29:29] {Additional required edit: Remove the Fortran standard
reference that was added in 5.3, and change the subclause reference at
the end of C506 to 13.8.2.26.}

[29:31+] Moved. {14-102r2} {Paper has edit at [29:37+] which is not
the correct order. Moved.}

[30:31] Done. {14-112r2}

[30:40] Modified. {14-112r2} {Changed the resulting text from "error
condition occurs other than STAT_FAILED_IMAGE" to "error condition
other than detection of a failed image occurs". The original implied
that STAT_FAILED_IMAGE was an error condition, rather than an integer
constant.}

[32:1-] Done. {14-111r2}

[32:1-] Modified. {14-107r2} {Instead of a new edit, I combined the
MOVE_ALLOC changes into the existing edit for NUM_IMAGES and
THIS_IMAGE.}

[32:6] Done. {14-112r2}

[32:6+] Modified. {14-107r2} {Reformatted the edit for changing the
MOVE_ALLOC title to match the style of NUM_IMAGES. Also added an edit
to remove the reference to the Fortran standard in the moved text.}

[33:12-13] Done. {14-104r2}

[33:26+] Modified. {14-102r2} {Changed last character of the edit from
"." to ";" since insert is in the middle of the list.}

[33:7] New. {Additional edit: Changed "image was member" to "image was
a member".}

[33:27-28] Done. {14-112r2}



TS Annex A
----------

[36:15] Modified. {14-112r2} {Simplified the 5 statement IF construct
to "read_checkpoint = this_image() > images_used".}

[36:36] Done. {14-112r2}

[37:6] New. {Additional edit: Added the program name to the END
PROGRAM statement to be consistent with other example codes.}

[37:10+] Modified. {14-110r1} {The A.1.4 example code has a PROGRAM
statement with no program name, which is a syntax error. Added name
row_column, and also added the name to the END PROGRAM statement.}

[37:20 - 38:44] Modified. {14-105r3} {The example code has a PROGRAM
statement with no program name, which is a syntax error. Added name
work_share, and also added the name to the END PROGRAM statement. Also
undo continuations in some cases to allow for longer lines in pdf
file. Converted comments on the USE statement to ONLY clause.}

[37:36] Not done. {14-112r2} {Text replaced by 14-105r3.}

[37:37] Not done. {14-112r2} {Text replaced by 14-105r3.}

[38:46-39:17] Modified {14-104r2} {Edit in paper started at 38:45
which removed the subsection title. Changed to start at 38:46 to
retain title. In first paragraph, change "that has a given" to "that
have a given".}



Part II: Technical repairs
===========================

[9:15+] {The new edit from 14-110r1 describing how a coarray becomes
"established" omits the case of a declaration in a BLOCK construct
(10-007r1, 5.3.6.3p3). In addition, an associating coarray is
established by the CHANGE TEAM statement execution, whereas for a
dummy argument it is not on entry to the procedure.  But the
associating coarray concept is modeled on argument association, so the
two cases should have parallel wording. Reworded the paragraph with
these issues addressed as follows.}

"A nonallocatable coarray that is neither a dummy argument, host
associated with a dummy argument, declared as a local variable of a
subprogram, nor declared in a BLOCK construct is established in the
initial team. An allocated allocatable coarray is established in the
team in which it was allocated. An unallocated allocatable coarray is
not established. An associating coarray is established in the team of
its CHANGE TEAM block. A nonallocatable coarray that is a dummy
argument or host associated with a dummy argument is established in
the team in which the procedure was invoked.  A nonallocatable coarray
that is a local variable of a subprogram or host associated with a
local variable of a subprogram is established in the team in which the
procedure was invoked.  A nonallocatable coarray declared in a BLOCK
construct is established in the team in which the BLOCK statement was
executed."

[10:23+] {The edit from {14-110r1} contains the following 2
paragraphs:

"Within a CHANGE TEAM construct, a coarray that does not appear in a
<coarray-association> has the corank and cobounds that it had when it
was established, apart from its final upper cobound.

Within a CHANGE TEAM construct, the final upper cobound of a coarray
is determined from the number of images in the current team."

The value of the final upper cobound affects two parts of the
standard.

1) The rule that cosubscripts always being within the cobounds:
10-007r1:[125:21-22] "The value of a cosubscript in an image selector
shall be within the cobounds for its codimension."  Similar wording
appears at 10-007r1:[93:2-3].

2) The value returned by the ucobound intrinsic, in
10-007r1:[395:17-18] "The final upper cobound is the final cosubscript
in the cosubscript list for the coarray that selects the image with
index NUM IMAGES( )."  The value of NUM_IMAGES() is not specified to
be associated with any particular team, since that concept did not
exist in F2008.  However, the logical reading of the current text
would be the value of NUM_IMAGES() at the point where UCOBOUNDS() is
invoked.

There is a basic conflict between these two cases in the context of
teams.  For an image selector that includes a team variable, the rule
in (1) would require that the final upper cobound be the one at the
time the coarray was established, so that the full range of the final
cosubscript is available within the rule.  On the other hand, (2)
implies that the final upper cobound is that based on the number of
images in the current team.  The wording in 14-110r1 assumes that (2)
is correct, requiring a change to the rule in (1).  Alternatively,
keeping the rule in (1) implies modifying the edit in 14-110r1 and the
wording in the Result Value for UCOBOUND.

In either case, the rule at 10-007r1:[125:24-25] "An image selector
shall specify an image index value that is not greater than the number
of images." needs to be modified to account for teams.

The two alternatives are:

A) Keep the current rule (1) unchanged, and have the final upper
cobound set at the point of establishing the coarray, and not changed
by changing teams.  Edits for this option:

14-110r1:[10:23+] In the first of the two paragraphs quoted above,
delete ", apart from its final upper cobound" and delete the second
paragraph.  This leaves:

"Within a CHANGE TEAM construct, a coarray that does not appear in a
<coarray-association> has the corank and cobounds that it had when it
was established."

[28:31+] Add a new edit:
"{In 6.6 Image selectors, edit the last sentence of the second
paragraph as follows.}

An image selector shall specify an image index value that is not
greater than the number of images \uwave{in the team specified by
<team-variable> if it appears or in the current team otherwise}."

[33:9+] Add an edit in 8.9 to modify UCOBOUND:
"{In 13.7.172 UCOBOUND, edit the Result Value as follows.}

The final upper cobound is the final cosubscript in the cosubscript
list for the coarray that selects the image with index
\sout{NUM_IMAGES( )} \uwave{equal to the number of images in the
current team when the coarray was established.}"


B) Have the final upper cobound of an already established coarray
(potentially) changed at the beginning a CHANGE TEAM block.  Edits for
this option are required at

[28:28+] to add a new subclause "8.5a Edits to Clause 5" and edit the
second sentence of the fourth paragraph of 5.3.6.3 Explicit-coshape
coarray.

[28:31+] Add 2 new edits, the first to edit the second sentence of the
second paragraph of 6.6 Image selectors, and the second that
duplicates the edit from Option A to edit the last sentence of the
second paragraph in the same subclause.

Option A seems less disruptive to basic Fortran concepts and simpler,
so those edits are included in the TS draft.}
