Subject:  Missing items from clause 19.6 Definition and
          undefinition of variables
Date: 2017 October 02

Discussion
----------

Section 19.6.3 Variables that are initially defined does not
cover EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE or TEAM_TYPE variables, or derived
types which are fully default initialized.

Section 19.6.5 Events that cause variables to become defined
does not mention the team variable specified in a FORM TEAM
statement gets defined if the FORM TEAM is successful.

Edits are provided to add these items.

Edit to 17-007r2
--------------

[527:33+] In 19.6.3 Variables that are initially defined add
"(6+) variables of a type whose components are all
initially defined;"

[530:10+] In 19.6.5 Events that cause a variable to become
defined add "(34+) Successful execution of a FORM TEAM
statement causes the team variable to become defined.".
