Subject:    IMPORT is incomplete
Date: 2015 October 08

1. Introduction
===============

IMPORT is like USE in some ways, and moreso with its new features.

It would be useful if an import name could be renamed by an IMPORT
statement, using the same syntax as for a USE statement, for some of the
same reasons that renaming is useful during use association.

IMPORT is a new feature, at least as far as its use in BLOCK is
concerned.  We shouldn't need a new license from WG5 to finish it before
claiming it's finished.

2. Edits
========

[286:7-8 R1211 import-stmt] Replace "<import-name-list>" with
"<import-list>" twice.

[286:10+ R1211+ import-stmt+] Insert a syntax rule:

"R1211a <import> <<is>> [ <local-name> => ] <import-name>"

[286:33+ C1211+ 12.4.3.4 IMPORT statement] Insert a constraint:

"C1211a (R1211) If <local-name> => appears, the optional double colon
        shall appear."

[287:12+ 12.4.3.4p5+ IMPORT statement] Insert a paragraph:

identified by <local-name> within the scoping unit; it is not accessible
by using its <import-name> within the scoping unit."
