         not be adopted as an ANSI standard.

         Rationale for recommendation not to adopt ISO/IEC 1539-3:2000

           ISO/IEC 1539-3 is neither widely supported nor used.

        "PL22.3 has advised INCITS and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5
         that ISO/IEC 1539-2 should be stabilized.  The
         intention of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5 is that ISO/IEC
         1539-2 be withdrawn when alternatives to its facilities
         are completely provided by ISO/IEC 1539-1.

         PL22.3 approves the following responses listed below for 2011
         Systematic Review of ISO/IEC 1539-2:2000 (Ed 2, vers 2) ,
         Information technology - Programming Languages - Fortran - Part
         2: Varying Length Character Strings

           Question 1: Recommended action

5. Adjournment

Motions:

  3a) PL22.3 recommends to the INCITS EB to approve the adoption
      of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 as an ANSI standard.

  3b) PL22.3 recommends to INCITS EB that ISO/IEC 1539-3 should
      not be adopted as an ANSI standard.

      Rationale for recommendation not to adopt ISO/IEC 1539-3:2000
      as an ANSI standard:
        ISO/IEC 1539-3 is neither widely supported nor used.

  3c) PL22.3 has advised INCITS and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5
      that ISO/IEC 1539-2 should be stabilized.  The
      intention of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5 is that ISO/IEC
      1539-2 be withdrawn when alternatives to its facilities
      are completely provided by ISO/IEC 1539-1.

      PL22.3 approves the following responses listed below for 2011
      Systematic Review of ISO/IEC 1539-2:2000 (Ed 2, vers 2) ,
      Information technology - Programming Languages - Fortran - Part
      2: Varying Length Character Strings

        Question 1: Recommended action
          Answer 1: Stabilize

        Question 2: Has this International Standard been adopted or
                    is it intended to be adopted in the future as a
                    national standard or other publication?
          Answer 2: yes, it is INCITS/ISO/IEC 1539-2:1994:[R2009]

        Question 3: Is the national publication identical to the
                    International Standard or was it modified?
          Answer 3: Identical

        Question 4: Is this International Standard used in your country
                    without national adoption or are products used in
                    your country based on this standard?
          Answer 4: Unknown

        Question 5: Is this International Standard, or its national
                    adoption, referenced in regulations in your country?
          Answer 5: Unknown
