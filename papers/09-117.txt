Subject: UTI 154, KIND of VALUE in ATOMIC_DEFINE/REF
Date: 2009 January 26
References: 09-007, 09-102

Discussion:

UTI 154 points out that the KIND for a VALUE integer argument to
ATOMIC_DEFINE or ATOMIC_REF is not specified, and that the wording
describing the action of the subroutine is subsequently
flawed. Because of the limited set of values for logical variables,
there is no corresponding problem for VALUE arguments of type
logical. The options provided by the editor are to specify the kind
for VALUE or to modify the action description.

Specification of the kind (as equal to atomic_int_kind) has the
drawback of requiring explicit kind specification for integer literal
constant arguments, since atomic_int_kind might be different from the
default kind. For example,

call atomic_define (i[3], 0)

would effectively be disallowed, even though this is what the user
would naturally write.

This is also unnecessary for logical values, (where forcing the use of
a kind specifier is even more unnatural) so is either unnecessarily
restrictive or asymmetric.

Therefore, the option of changing the action description is reflected
in the edits below.

Edits to 09-007:

[337:24] Change the last sentence of the description of the ATOM
argument in "13.7.20 ATOMIC_DEFINE ..." to "If its kind is the same as
that of VALUE or its type is logical, it becomes defined with the
value of VALUE. Otherwise, it becomes defined with the value of
INT(VALUE,ATOMIC_INT_KIND).".

[338:6-7] Change the last sentence of the description of the VALUE
argument in "13.7.21 ATOMIC_REF ..." to "If its kind is the same as
that of ATOM or its type is logical, it becomes defined with the value
of ATOM. Otherwise, it is defined with the value of
INT(ATOM,ATOMIC_INT_KIND).".
