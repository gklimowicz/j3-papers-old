Subject: Can child I/O statements be advancing I/O statements?

NUMBER:
TITLE: Can child I/O statements be advancing I/O statements?
KEYWORDS: UDDTIO, ADVANCE=
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

[175:30-31] of Fortran 2003 states:
    An advancing input/output statement always positions a record file
    after the last record read or written, unless there is an error
    condition.

Since a child I/O statement does not position a file after the last
record, this implies that a child I/O statement cannot be an advancing
I/O statement.

[189:6-9] of Fortran 2003 states:
    The ADVANCE= specifier determines whether advancing input/output
    occurs for this input/output statement. If YES is specified,
    advancing input/output occurs. If NO is specified, nonadvancing
    input/output occurs (9.2.3.1). If this specifier is omitted from
    an input/output statement that allows the specifier, the default
    value is YES.

This clearly states that any data transfer statement is an advancing
I/O statement if the value 'NO' is not specified for the ADVANCE=
specifier.

These two statements seem to contradict each other.  If a child I/O
statement does not have an ADVANCE= specifier with the value 'NO', is
it an advancing I/O statement?


DISCUSSION:

The answer to this question affects the value for the IOSTAT variable
for child READ statements in some situations.  For example, in the
following program, the value of "stat1" should be equal to IOSTAT_EOF
if the child READ statement is advancing, but it should be equal to
IOSTAT_EOR if the statement is nonadvancing.

      MODULE m
        TYPE t
          CHARACTER(2) :: x(2)
        CONTAINS
          PROCEDURE :: readT
          GENERIC :: READ(FORMATTED) => readT
        END TYPE
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE readT(dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
          CLASS(t), INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
          INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: unit
          CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: iotype
          INTEGER, INTENT(IN)  :: v_list(:)
          INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: iostat
          CHARACTER(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg
          READ (unit, '(2a2)', IOSTAT=iostat) dtv%x
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

      PROGRAM p
        USE m
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(t) t1
        CHARACTER(3) :: c = '123'
        INTEGER stat1
        READ (c, *, IOSTAT=stat1) t1
        PRINT *, (stat1 == IOSTAT_EOR), (stat1 == IOSTAT_EOF)
      END PROGRAM


ANSWER:

No, such a child I/O statement is not advancing.  Edits are provided
to correct this inconsistency.


EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[189:7]  After "If YES is specified", insert
         "for a nonchild input/output statement".

[189:8]  After "If NO is specified", insert
         "for a nonchild input/output statement, or if an
         input/output statement is a child statement".
