Discussion

It is not intended to use the term "co-array" for an element or section of
an array co-array. For example, [319:25-27] says: "The actual argument shall
be a co-array or a subobject of a co-array without any co-subscripts,
vector-valued subscripts, non-co-array allocatable component selection,
or pointer component selection.".

It is desirable to say this clearly in Section 2.


Edit to J3/07-007

[20:11]. At the end of the first paragraph of 2.4.6 Co-array, add
"An element or section of an array co-array is not a co-array."
