Subject: Dummy arguments of assumed type and size

1. Introduction
---------------

It is a requirement of the user community that a dummy argument which is
assumed-type assumed-size can be associated with a scalar actual argument.
That functionality is not provided by TS 29113 as published.

Furthermore, the semantics in TS 29113 for character actual arguments being
associated with an assumed-type assumed-size dummy are poorly specified, as
the number of elements in the dummy is the number of elements in the actual
times the character length of the actual divided by the character length of
the dummy, and the dummy does not have any character length.

these problems should be fixed in any corrigendum to TS 29113, and in any
case as an integration issue in Fortran 2015.

This paper replaces part (D) of 13-261.

2. Edits to 10-007r1
--------------------

In addition to the edits in TS 29113 subclause 9.7:

[294:28] 12.5.2.4p13 rewrite:
 - split the first sentence into a separate paragraph
 - replace the rest with a new paragraph

  "If the actual argument is a noncoindexed scalar, the corresponding dummy
   argument shall be scalar unless
   \begin{itemise}
   \item
   the actual argument is default character, of type character with the C
   character kind (15.2.2), or is an element or substring of an element of
   an array that is not an assumed-shape, pointer, or polymorphic array,
   \item
   the dummy argument has assumed rank, or
   \item
   the dummy argument is an assumed-type assumed-size array.
   \end{itemise}
{Allow scalar to associate with an assumptive dummy.}

[298:30] 12.5.2.11p1,
  after "represents an element sequence if"
  change "it" to
    "the dummy argument is not assumed-type and the actual argument".
{If the dummy argument is assumed-type, we don't have traditional sequence
 association - especially in the case of character, otherwise we get a
 divide by NaN trying to calculate the number of elements.}

[299:g+] 12.5.2.11p4+, insert new paragraph
  "If an assumed-type dummy argument is an assumed-size array and the
   actual argument is scalar, the dummy array has exactly one element.
   Otherwise, an assumed-type assumed-size dummy array has the same number
   of elements as the actual argument."
{New thingo semantics in "sequence" association.}
