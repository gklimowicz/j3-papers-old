1. Opening of the Meeting
The meeting opened at 09:00 on 3rd August 2015.

2. Opening business
2.1 Introductory remarks from the Convenor
The convenor welcomed participants, especially those attending WG5 for the
first time, Tom Clune and Bob Scollard. He said that the principal
objectives of the meeting were to construct the draft TS on further coarray
facilities and to decide on new proposals for the revision of Fortran 2008.
There was an open WG5 straw ballot on Fortran 2008 interpretations.

2.2 Welcome from the Host
Jane Sleightholme welcomed participants on behalf of BSI and BCS.  The
co-host, Ian Chivers, was not present because of his wife's illness.  The
meeting sent best wishes for her rapid return to health.

2.3 Local arrangements
Jane Sleightholme invited participants to dinner at the Salieri restaurant
on the Wednesday evening.  The BCS Fortran Specialist Group had contributed
towards the cost of the dinner.

2.4 Appointments for this meeting
The drafting committee was Reinhold Bader, Daniel Chen, Toon Moene, David
Muxworthy (chair), Steve Lionel and Masayuki Takata.  David Muxworthy acted
as secretary and John Reid as librarian.

2.5 Adoption of the agenda [N2052]
The preliminary agenda was adopted, subject to two minor amendments: at
item 6 'DTS' was changed to 'TS' and at item 7 '15-006' was changed to
'15-006r1'.

3. Matters arising from the minutes of the Las Vegas 2014 Meeting [N2020]
There were no items not otherwise on the agenda.

4. Status of Las Vegas 2014 Resolutions [N2021]
There was nothing to report.

5. Reports
5.1 SC22 Matters (Convener)
John Reid had been re-appointed as convenor for the period to September
2017.  He said that he would not stand for a further term.

Document archive.  The document archive had been re-arranged at NAG's
request.  Older documents (to N2019), and other WG5 pages, would remain on
the NAG site but all new WG5 numbered documents would be on ISO's Livelink
system.  All documents would be accessible via the 'Complete Document
Register'.  Some members had had difficulty accessing documents without
entering passwords.

[N2064 gathers numerous country proposals to new features in F2015:

  US-22     15-193         Purity enhancement
  US-23     15-204r1       Command line on images .ne. 1
  US-24     15-194         Specification expressions
  US-25     15-202         SIGN with mixed kind
  US-26     15-203         Pointer args to SAME_TYPE_AS
  US-271    15-142r2       SELECT RANK
  US-28     15-197         DO CONCURRENT locality specs]

5.2 National Activity Reports
Canada:      There was little standards activity related to Fortran.
Germany:     Reinhold Bader was now officially representing DIN.
Japan:       The Japanese Fortran Group had ten members and met once per
             month.  Preparation for the Japanese version of Fortran
             2008 continued but was progressing slowly because of lack
             of resources.
Netherlands: Toon Moene was now an advisor to, rather than a member
             of, the Programming Languages Committee of NEN.
UK:          A report was in N2060.  The main activity had been in
             participating in email discussion on development of the
             Further Coarray TS.
US:          The main activity was that of PL22.3.  The US had voted
             approval in the SC22 ballot on the Further Coarray TS. There
             would be a US TAG meeting on the Thursday of the meeting.

5.3 Report from Primary Development Body (INCITS/PL22.3)
Development had been proceeding to schedule.  Some new proposals were
available for consideration at this meeting.  The Project Editor summarized
items which had been incorporated in the latest Working Draft of the full
language standard, j3/15-007r1.

5.4 Reports from other Development Bodies (Editors/Heads)
Further Coarray TS: Bill Long
     The TS had been approved in the recent SC22 ballot and the
     comments from national bodies would be considered at this meeting.

5.5 Liaison Reports:
NCITS/PL22.11 (C): Dan Nagle
     The CPLEX work, to provide parallel facilities in C, was continuing
     and was approaching completion.  An estimated completion date was not
     yet available.

MPI: Bill Long
     MPI 3.1 had been published. This was mainly a corrections update to
     3.0.  The plan for MPI 4.0 included deprecating mpif.h in favour of
     using the modules. It was planned to delete mpif.h in MPI 5.0.

UPC: Damian Rouson
     UPC retained broad support with multiple vendors and academic groups
     producing compilers.  However, there appeared to be no movement toward
     merging into the standard, which led to the technical issue that UPC
     must decide to "rebase" against each new C standard (see
     https://goo.gl/LGrKQC), which in turn raised the question of how
     potential future conflicts would be handled.  A personal impression
     was that the path forward was clearer for UPC++, which had a very
     clear and well-worn path toward standardization.  UPC++ was being
     developed in a "compiler-free" manner by simply defining a set of
     templates in a "upcxx" namespace.  As is often the case with C++
     growing by agglomeration, adding UPC++ to the C++ standard might be no
     more than changing the namespace to "std".  We might do well to keep
     an eye on developments with UPC++.

IFIP/WG2.5 [Numerical Software]: Van Snyder
     Philip Sharp of the University of Auckland, New Zealand, had attended
     the recent WG2.5 meeting and had expressed interest in joining WG5 and
     possibly PL22.3.

[Ada: Van Snyder
     Liaison report from WG9. Discussed maintenance scheme that they are
     following. Produced a corrigendum. Van will help with correcting
     the interoperability with Fortran annex. (Currently recommends
     things like REAL*8)]

OpenMP: Bill Long
     OpenMP 4.1 had been released.  It added support, compared to
     OpenMP 4.0 for
     - Allocatable enhancement
     - Finalization
     - Procedures bound by name to a type
     - Type extension

     Fortran 2003 features still missing from OpenMP 4.1:
     - IEEE Arithmetic issues covered in Fortran 2003 Section 14
     - Parameterized derived types
     - The PASS attribute
     - Procedures bound to a type as operators
     - Overriding a type-bound procedure
     - Polymorphic entities
     - SELECT TYPE construct
     - Deferred bindings and abstract types
     - Controlling IEEE underflow
     - Another IEEE class value

     OpenMP 5.0 would try to finish support for Fortran 2003.  There was an
     "interoperability" subgroup that was discussing interactions with
     other parallel models, but was mainly focused on shared-memory
     threading (C++), and not on distributed models like coarrays.

WG23 (Vulnerabilities): Dan Nagle
     Eight new vulnerabilities had been defined, six of them related to
     parallelism. The Fortran Annex was being developed to incorporate
     these.

OpenACC: Bob Scollard
     OpenACC now had several high profile success cases, particularly in
     the weather / climate community, which were largely Fortran code
     bases.  The majority of these codes currently targeted systems with
     X86 host + NVIDIA Tesla GPUs.

     The committee was working on an OpenACC 2.5 specification, with
     several minor changes to the current version.

     The biggest item that users had requested was support for 'deep copy.'
     This is deferred until the next major release.  Deep copy was similar
     to sourced allocation in Fortran. However, implementing this
     capability in systems with physically, logically, and virtually
     separated memories and address spaces was a significant
     challenge. Implementing deep copy in a way that was efficient, useful,
     and easy to understand was also a significant challenge.

     More information was available at http://www.openacc-standard.org/.

The convenor said that from this point the following agenda items would
proceed in parallel:

6.  Construct the TS on Additional Parallel Features in Fortran.
7.  Consider the Fortran defect reports (interpretations) in J3/15-006r1.
8.  Confirm the list of deficiencies and discrepancies in Fortran 2008
    to be addressed in the next revision.
9.  Review of the current draft of the next revision.
10. WG5 Business and Strategic Plans

[In fact no business was transacted for agenda items 7 and 9.]

{agenda 8} Subgroups considered the new proposals to address deficiencies
in Fortran 2008 which were listed in N2069.

** /WG5 **

It appeared that WG5 was intending to endorse all the items carried forward
from 2014 and many of those put forward this year.  Vendors present were
asked for their reaction.  Most were still working on Fortran 2008 and
would start on Fortran 2015 only when that was completed, which could be up
to three years in the future.  gfortran, working in a different
environment, was giving very low priority to user-defined derived-type
input-output and parameterized derived types and would adopt Fortran 2015
features according to user demand.

** /WG5 **

{agenda 8} There was a brief presentation and straw vote on each of the
proposals considered by subgroups the previous day. It was decided that
taking country votes would not be appropriate.  The vote would be on the
concept, not necessarily on the detailed edits.  In some cases there was
discussion on amending the proposal but each vote was taken on the item as
presented.  [The results follow merged with J3 business:  WG5 and J3 votes
are as marked.]

{agenda 10} A draft Strategic Plan for 2015 - 2018 was discussed.  This
showed the Further Coarray TS being completed one month earlier than
previously scheduled and the full language revision five months later than
previously scheduled, in July 2018.  After discussion the plan remained
unchanged.  [N2070-1]

In 2013 Van Snyder had introduced a draft TS on Units of Measure in Fortran
(ref N1969, N1970, N1977).  It would be useful for his sponsors to know why
WG5 had not adopted this project.  The convenor agreed to provide a

airport.  Detailed information would be distributed in due course.

Reinhold Bader asked WG5 for its preference for dates for the 2017 meeting.
It was decided to hold it on June 26 to 30.

** /WG5 **

{agenda 6} A revised, almost complete, draft Disposition of Comments
document for the SC22 ballot on TS 18508, was presented and discussed.  No
amendments were proposed. [N2066-4]

{agenda 10} A revised Strategic Plan (N2070) was discussed and approved,
the principal change being the addition of a statement that a future
revision would not start before 2017.  It was agreed that the committee
needed to take a long-term strategic view and not continue with simply
adding individual features.  Also, more notice should be taken of vendors'
resources.

The Plan scheduled a new work item vote for the revision to take place in
September to December 2016.  This was queried, given the revised JTC1
Directives.  The matter was not resolved at the meeting. [According to JTC1
Directive 2.3.1 (2015 version) a NWIP vote is not required for a revision.]
It was noted that avoiding a vote would not affect the schedule.

The Convenor's Report to SC22 (N2071) was discussed.  Comments were
welcomed but had to be made immediately.

{agenda 8} Attention was drawn to a document (N2073) listing the new
language features approved at this meeting.

A draft of the resolutions (N2067) was discussed and minor edits suggested.

           WG5: straw vote with 3 options and undecided:

            1: Basically what the actual text of the standard says now:
               Accessing a PROTECTED item by a USE statement will hide
               the host association, and therefore the item will be
               protected.

            2: Continue to allow a submodule to USE its ancestor, but
               say that PROTECTED has no effect in this case.

            3: Decide that it was a mistake to allow a submodule to
               access its ancestor module by use association, and
               forbid it.

             SV: Option 1: 3  Option 2: 1   Option 3: 9   Undecided: 2

           of DO CONCURRENT?" [Snyder]

           WG5: straw vote with 2 options and undecided:

            1: It was intended that nonadvancing input/output on a
               single unit not be permitted during more than one
               iteration of a DO CONCURRENT construct.

               An edit is provided to address this oversight.

            2: It was intended that nonadvancing input/output not be
               permitted within a DO CONCURRENT construct.

               An edit is provided to address this oversight.

            SV: Option 1: 3   Option 2: 8   Undecided: 4

5.2 Closing business

5.3 Review of action items

   1) Stan Whitlock will send the J3 minutes 15-215 to Lynn Barra
      (lbarra@itic.org)

   2) Malcolm Cohen is planning to have a new 15-007r2 by the beginning
      of September, 2015 [it will not include collectives or teams from
      TS 18508]

   3) Dan Nagle to put new 14-018 "change pages for F2008 for Corrigenda
      1, 2, & 3" as new standing document 018

   4) Van Snyder will update 15-010 "J3 Work Plan" and Dan Nagle will
      put it as new standing document 010

   5) For the next meeting (m208, Las Vegas, October, 2015), we will
      move to A/B/C groups for reviewing the draft:

        Group A (JoR):  Introduction - Chapter 7
        Group B (Data): Chapters 8 - 12
        Group C (HPC):  Chapter 13 - Annex C

        Everyone should look for processor dependencies not in the
        Introduction and should be critical of the content of Annex C

      Some instructions from the editor:

        (1) editing instructions should give the whole subclause heading
            and paragraph number (you can say "same subclause" if it's the
            same as the previous edit)
        (2) when moving/deleting please include the first few and last few
            words of the text to be moved/deleted
        (3) NOTEs are not numbered in the source so they also need
            context and/or contents
        (4) BNF rules should give the name not just the number

        This will help the editor to work efficiently and reduce the
        likelihood of an editing mistake
