Subject: HUGE is incomplete. C_LOC has a redundant description.
Date: 2022-March-03
Reference: 22-007, 22-117

JOR has reviewed 22-117 and has chosen John Reid's revised edit below 
as a clarification for the CD, and does not believe the other
edits proposed in 22-117 are necessary and/or appropriate.

The description of the HUGE intrinsic function is "Largest model value",
which is incomplete if the argument is of enumeration type.

EDITS 

[353 Table 16.1 HUGE] After "value" add " or last enumeration value" so
that the text reads "Largest model value or last enumeration value.".

[398:2 16.9.96p1 HUGE] After "value" add " or last enumeration value" so
that the sentence reads "Largest model value or last enumeration value.".

END of EDITS
This mirrors the wording in NEXT and PREVIOUS.
