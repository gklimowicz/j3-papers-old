NUMBER: 000067
TITLE: Writing zeros
KEYWORDS:  list-directed output, namelist output
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

The standard currently requires a real zero to be
written in exponential form when using list-directed
or namelist output.

QUESTION: Is this requirement intentional or an oversight?

ANSWER: The requirement is an oversight, but is not an appropriate
        problem to fix in Fortran 95 via an interpretation.

EDIT: None.
