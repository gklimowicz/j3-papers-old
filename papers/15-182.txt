These editorial suggestions are intended not to change technical
content.

[113:18-19 R560] Eliminate the extraneous blank line.

[121:19 6.2p2] Replace "data object" with "variable" (that's what
appears in the title of 16.6.5, which is referenced here).

[121:20 6.2p2] Append a sentence: "A variable becomes undefined when
events described in 16.6.6 occur."

[131:3-4 C639] <source-expr> can only appear if SOURCE= appears.  The
constraint would be clearer if SOURCE= appeared earlier.  Replace C639:

"C639 (R626) If SOURCE= appears, each <allocate-object> shall be type
      compatible (4.3.2.3) with <source-expr>, and <source-expr> shall
      be a scalar or have the same rank as each <allocate-object>."

[157:24+3-5 Table 7.8]  Replace the three lines specifying numeric types
with the single simpler line
"numeric intrinsic type     &      numeric intrinsic type\\"

[164:4 7.2.2.3p10] Replace "If no <bounds-remapping-list> appears" with
"If <bounds-remapping-list> does not appear".

[332:13 13.8.1p3] Replace "no ... or" with "neither ... nor".
