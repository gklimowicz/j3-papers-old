The first sentence of paragraph 7 of subclause 10.1.11
"Specification expression" [168:1-3] states

      If a specification expression includes a
      specification inquiry that depends on a type
      parameter, array bound, or cobound of an entity
      specified in the same /specification-part/,
      the type parameter, array bound, or cobound
      shall be specified in a prior specification of
      the /specification-part/.

One problem with this sentence is that a specification
inquiry can depend on the type of an entity without
depending on its type parameters.  Another problem is
that it does not account for implicit declarations.
Edits are provided.
