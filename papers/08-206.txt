Subject: Editorial stuff concerning "transfer of control"
Date: 2008 June 10

1.  Introduction

2.4.5 is poorly structured.  It ought to specify the normal execution
sequence first, then the exceptions.  Rather, it specifies one
exception, then the normal sequence, then some more exceptions.

2.4.5 doesn't explain how execution proceeds when execution of a
procedure completes.  RETURN [307: 12.6.2.7p1] just says it completes
execution of a procedure (in the case an alternative return is not
taken, which is explained by reference to branching).  END is defined in
terms of RETURN.

FORALL and WHERE constructs are not mentioned in 2.4.5.  We can't just
add them to the second list item because they do not have "implicit
internal branching".  DO CONCURRENT is not properly treated in 2.4.5; it
isn't really like other DO constructs in that it does not have "implicit
internal branching".

The term "transfer of control" is not defined.  There is an indirect
suggestion of its meaning where 8.2p1 specifies that it is the result of
a branch, but this is circular reasoning.  8.2p1 says that procedure
references and control structures also cause transfer of control, but
the term is used in several places where this is clearly not desired.
Subclause 2.4.5 specifies the execution sequence.  The term "change the
normal execution sequence", with reference to 2.4.5, should be used
instead.

Assuming the term "transfer of control" means "change the normal
execution sequence," it is almost always used incorrectly; it usually
ought to be "branch".

2.  Edits w.r.t. 08-007r2.

[11: 2.1.11+] ----------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert a subclause:

"2.1.11a branch
change the normal sequence of execution (8.2)"

[18: 2.1.79+] ----------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert a subclause:

"2.1.79a Normal execution sequence
execution of executable constructs in the order in which they appear
(2.4.5)"

[31: 2.4.5p1] ----------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete "When ... point."  It will reappear later.

[31: 2.4.5p1] ----------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "effect of execution" by "effect of the <<normal
execution sequence>>".

{Define the term "normal execution sequence", which will be used in
8.2.1.}

[31: 2.4.5p1] ----------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert "within a scoping unit" before "are executed in the
order".

[31: 2.4.5p1] ----------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the first list item by:

"o When a procedure is invoked, the specification expressions within the
   <specification-part> of the invoked procedure, if any, are evaluated
   in a processor dependent order.  Thereafter, the execution sequence
   proceeds to the first executable construct appearing within the
   scoping unit of the procedure after the invoked entry point.

"o When execution of a subroutine invoked by execution of a CALL
   statement completes, execution of the CALL statement that invoked the
   subroutine completes.  When execution of a function completes,
   evaluation of the expression in which it was invoked either continues
   or completes.  When execution of a final subroutine or a user-defined
   input/output subroutine that was invoked as part of another process
   completes, that process either continues or completes.

"o Branching (8.2, 9.11.3, 9.11.4, 12.6.2.7) changes the execution
   sequence by explicitly specifying a new starting place, within the
   same scoping unit as the branch, for the execution sequence."

[31: 2.4.5p1] ----------------------------------------------------------
Editor: After "DO constructs" in the second list item, insert "other
than DO CONCURRENT constructs" or "that are not DO CONCURRENT
constructs".

[31: 2.4.5p1] ----------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert list items after the second one:

"o  A DO CONCURRENT construct (8.1.7) cases a <block> to be executed a
    specified number of times.  During execution of the <block> the
    sequence of execution proceeds as specified in this subclause, but
    the order of execution of the <block>s is not specified."

"o  A WHERE construct (7.2.3) causes <where-body-construct>s to be
    executed.  During execution of a <where-body-construct> the sequence
    of execution proceeds as specified in this subclause, but the order
    of execution of the <where-body-construct>s is not specified."

"o  A FORALL construct (7.2.4) causes a <forall-body-construct> to be
    executed a specified number of times.  During execution of the
    <forall-body-construct> the sequence of execution proceeds as
    specified in this subclause, but the order of execution of the
    <forall-body-construct>s is not specified."

[52: 4.4.3: NOTE 4.8] --------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "transfer of control" by "branch (8.2)".

[128: 6.6.3.2p2] -------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "When ... statement" by "When a RETURN or END statement
is executed".

{We don't want the executable constructs after the point of execution of
the procedure to start executing until after the allocatable variables
are deallocated.}

[169: 8.1.2.1p1] -------------------------------------------------------

Editor: Replace "Transfer of control" by "Branching (8.2)" to remove any
possibility that "transfer of control" might be interpreted as a
procedure reference.  8.2.1 explicitly says that there are transfers of
control that are not branches.

[169: 8.1.2.1p2] -------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete 8.1.2.1p2 because it is repetitive of 2.4.5.

[169: 8.1.7.4p1] -------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the paragraph by

"The <<range>> of a block DO construct is the <do-block>."

The remainder of the paragraph is repetitive of 8.1.2.1p1.

At least replace "transfer of control" by "branching (8.2)".

[169: 8.1.7.4p2] -------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "transfer of control" by "branching (8.2)".

[177: 8.1.7.6.1p1] -----------------------------------------------------
Editor: After "DO statement" insert "other than a DO CONCURRENT
statement" or "that is not a DO CONCURRENT statement".

[179: 8.1.7.6.3p5] -----------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the first "transfer of control" by "branch (8.2)" the
second by "branching", and the third by "branch".

[186: 8.2.1p1] ---------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the first two sentences to use the definition of
execution sequence in 2.4.5:

"<<Branching>> alters the normal execution sequence (2.4.5).  When a
branch occurs, the next statement executed is the branch target
statement, in the same scoping unit, that is labeled by the label in the
branch, instead of the one that appears next in sequence in the main
program or subprogram."

Editor: Replace second "transfer of control" by "changes in the normal
execution sequence".

[186: 8.2.2p1] ---------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the paragraph by:

"Execution of a <<GO TO statement>> causes a branch to the branch target
statement identified by the label."

{Use the definitions of "branch" and "branch target statement" in
8.2.1.}

[186: 8.2.3p1] ---------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "a transfer of control ... is the one" by "a branch
occurs to the branch target statement"

{Use the definitions of "branch" and "branch target statement" in
8.2.1.}

[186: 8.2.4p1] ---------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "transfer of control" by "branch".  Insert "is the one"
before "identified".  Replace "is executed next" by a comma.  The result
is "The branch target statement is the one identified by the first
label, the second label, or the third label, depending on...."

{Use the definitions of "branch" and "branch target statement" in
8.2.1.}

[307: 12.6.2.7p1] ------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "transfers control to the" by "branches (8.2) to the
branch target".  Replace "transfer of control" by "branch".

{Use the definitions of "branch" and "branch target statement" in
8.2.1.}

[600] ------------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the index items "transfer of control" by "branch",
especially the ones on pp 237-238, because they actually use the term
"branch".  Add an index item for "branch" in 12.6.2.7p1.
