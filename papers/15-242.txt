Discussion
----------

In 13.1p5 the sentence concerning specific names of intrinsics should
be in \obs font. These were made obsolescent in B.3.12. An edit is
provided to convert this sentence to obsolescence font.

In 13.8.71 EVENT_QUERY, the description of the COUNT variable says "If
no error condition occurs, COUNT is assigned the value of the count of
EVENT; otherwise, it is assigned the value -1."  If an error condition
does occur, the COUNT is defined to be -1. COUNT is INTENT(OUT).
EVENT_QUERY is an atomic subroutine.  However, 13.5 Atomic
subroutines, para 5 says "If the STAT argument is present in an
invocation of an atomic subroutine and an error condition occurs, it
is assigned a processor-dependent positive value, and any other
argument that is not INTENT(IN) becomes undefined.".  This implies
that COUNT becomes undefined if an error occurs and STAT is
specified. This contradicts the description of COUNT on EVENT_QUERY.
An edit is provided that assumes the semantics in EVENT_QUERY are
intended.

In 13.8.153 REDUCE the description of the OPERATION argument says it
"should" implement an associative operation. A suggestion seems
inadequate here. A requirement is needed.  And edit is provided to
change "should" to "shall".


Edits to 15-007r2:
------------------

[321:17-18] 13.1 Classes of intrinsic procedures, para 5, convert the
last sentence "Specific names of standard intrinsic functions
... 13.7." to \obs font.

[325:7-8] 13.5 Atomic subroutines, para 5, change "any other argument
that is not INTENT(IN) becomes undefined" to "any other argument,
except the COUNT argument of EVENT_QUERY, that is not INTENT(IN)
becomes undefined".

[395:35] 13.8.153 REDUCE..., int the OPERATION argument description,
change "OPERATION should implement" to "OPERATION shall implement".
