Subject: Edits for US 2.14 Intrinsic and nonintrinsic modules

One item in n1510 asks whether an Intrinsic module
and a nonintrinsic module can have the same name
in the same program.

This paper borrows edits from 159 to answer yes.
These edits are against 02-007r3.

EDITS:

11:41-42   Change  "A program unit may be
a main program, an external subprogram, a module,
or a block data program unit."
	   to      "A program unit may be
a main program, an external subprogram, a nonintrinsic module,
or a block data program unit."


19:3 Change "dummy argument," to "dummy argument, intrinsic module,"
 in the list of program constituent examples.  There's another
 list in 2.5.1 but since it's incomplete, leave it alone.

245:3 Change "a module" to "a nonintrinsic module" in the redefinition
of program unit.

246:4-5  Add after "A nonintrinsic module is defined by a
module program unit or a means other than Fortran" the sentence

"A module defined by a module program unit is
a nonintrinsic module."
