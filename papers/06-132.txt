Subject: Team Formation in Co-Array Fortran
Reference: WG5 worklist item, Co-Array Fortran
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The current CAF proposal specifies a team of images as a set of images that
are collaborating in a computation.  The members of the team are
specified by an rank-one default integer array that holds the image
indices, with no duplication.  Teams are used in collective operations
such as synchronization.

The specification of a team in the current CAF proposal works fine as long
as the number of members of a team is small.  Unfortunately the current
proposal does not scale to large numbers of processors.

Team formation can require significant resources, as communication schedules
must be calculated, stored and the results shared across team members.
In the current CAF proposal, team formation must be done each time a team
is used.  This will likely mean that collectives operations cannot take
advantage of O(log n) algorithms (where n is the number of team members).

Because processor counts now exceed 150 K and will certainly exceed at
least one million in the lifetime of CAF, it is proposed that the cost of
team formation be amortized by providing intrinsic functions to both form
and destroy a team.
