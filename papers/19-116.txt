Paragraph 2 of the introduction on page xiii, second bullet (Data

operations (also known as .EQ. and .NE.)".  The first "=" should 
be "==" indicating the equality operator.

An edits is provided to fix this.

Edit to 18-007r1:
------------------

[xiii] Introduction, p2, bullet 2, sixth sentence 
Change "= and /= operators" to "== and /= operators"
