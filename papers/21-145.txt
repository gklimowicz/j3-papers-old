1. Introduction

(A)Paragraph 2 in clause 11.1.2.2 says
"an EXIT statement or CYCLE statement statement that belongs to a construct
that contains the block is executed."

"CYCLE statement statement" above should be changed to "CYCLE statement"
as "statement" appears twice.



(B) C1570 in Paragraph 1 in clause 15.6.2.6 says
"C1570 (R1541) If RESULT appears, the entry-name shall not appear in any
specification or type declaration statement in the scoping unit of the
function program."

The term "function program" above should be changed to 
the proper term "function subprogram".



(C)Paragraph 3 in clause 17.2 says
"The type IEEE_CLASS_TYPE, for identifying a class of floating-point
 values. Its only possible values are those of named constants defined in
 the module: IEEE_SIGNALING_NAN, IEEE_QUIET_NAN, IEEE_NEGATIVE_INF,
 IEEE_NEGATIVE_NORMAL, IEEE_NEGATIVE_DENORMAL, IEEE_NEGATIVE_ZERO,
 IEEE_POSITIVE_ZERO, IEEE_POSITIVE_SUBNORMAL, IEEE_POSITIVE_NORMAL,
 IEEE_POSITIVE_INF, and IEEE_OTHER_VALUE. The named constants IEEE_-
 NEGATIVE_DENORMAL and IEEE_POSITIVE_DENORMAL are defined with the same
 value as IEEE_NEGATIVE_SUBNORMAL and IEEE_POSITIVE_SUBNORMAL
 respectively."

The first appearance of IEEE_NEGATIVE_DENORMAL should be changed to
IEEE_NEGATIVE_SUBNORMAL, as the former is defined as the alias of the
latter in the last sentence.

Therefore this paper suggests modifying (A)Paragraph 2 in clause 11.1.2.2,
(B)C1570 in Paragraph 1 in clause 15.6.2.6, and (C)Paragraph 3 in clause
17.2 in ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5/N2184 as follows.


2. Edits to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5/N2184

(A) Paragraph 2 in clause 11.1.2.2 [184:1]
Change
   "an EXIT statement or CYCLE statement statement that belongs to a
    construct that contains the block is executed."
to
   "an EXIT statement or CYCLE statement that belongs to a construct
    that contains the block is executed."


(B) C1570 in Paragraph 1 in clause 15.6.2.6 [335:31]
Change
   "C1570 (R1541) If RESULT appears, the entry-name shall not appear in any
    specification or type declaration statement in the scoping unit of the
    function program."
to
   "C1570 (R1541) If RESULT appears, the entry-name shall not appear in any
    specification or type declaration statement in the scoping unit of the
    function subprogram."


(C) Paragraph 3 in clause 17.2 [458:19]
Change
   "The type IEEE_CLASS_TYPE, for identifying a class of floating-point
    values. Its only possible values are those of named constants defined
    in the module: IEEE_SIGNALING_NAN, IEEE_QUIET_NAN, IEEE_NEGATIVE_INF,
    IEEE_NEGATIVE_NORMAL, IEEE_NEGATIVE_DENORMAL, IEEE_NEGATIVE_ZERO,
    IEEE_POSITIVE_ZERO, IEEE_POSITIVE_SUBNORMAL, IEEE_POSITIVE_NORMAL,
    IEEE_POSITIVE_INF, and IEEE_OTHER_VALUE."
to
   "The type IEEE_CLASS_TYPE, for identifying a class of floating-point
    values. Its only possible values are those of named constants defined
    in the module: IEEE_SIGNALING_NAN, IEEE_QUIET_NAN, IEEE_NEGATIVE_INF,
