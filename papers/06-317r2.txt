Subject: Issues 42 & 43, teams for preconnected units
Reference: J3/06-007r1, J3/06-258, J3/06-338r1

Discussion of issues 42 and 43 (page 220)

The intention is not to affect the behaviour on image 1 of preconnected
units and the units INPUT_UNIT, OUTPUT_UNIT, ERROR_UNIT, but to
limit their use on other images to simple output. The main mechanism
for parallel i/o is the direct-access file, connected through an
OPEN statement.

We agree that the present wording is overly restrictive, and that the
connect team for INPUT_UNIT should be image 1.

While discussing this paper we realized that the description of the
CLOSE statement did not explain that it causes team synchronization.
This was only explained in the description of SYNC TEAM.

If some of the images have initiated termination, the implicit
synchronization implied by the CLOSE statement for a unit with a
connect team that has more than one image (8.5.3) will fail. The IOSTAT
variable can be used to catch the error there, or, if there isn't one,
abnormal termination will occur. This is addressed in 06-338r1.

Edits to J3/06-007r1

[220:7-10] Replace the last paragraph of 9.4.5.17 TEAM= specifier:
"Units connected to a preconnected file, other than the unit identified
by the value INPUT_UNIT in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV have a
connect team consisting of all the images. If an image with index
greater than one executes an input/output statement on one of these
units, it shall not be a READ statement. The unit identified by the
value INPUT_UNIT in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is preconnected
with a connect team consisting of image 1 on image 1 and is not
preconnected on other images."

[220:10+] Add a new sentence to the end of Note 9.24:
"File positioning statements are not allowed for preconnected units,
including units preconnected to OUTPUT_UNIT and ERROR_UNIT, since they
have a connect team that has more than one image. The FLUSH and INQUIRE
statements are allowed for preconnected units."

[221:17+] Add a new paragraph
"If an image executes a CLOSE statement, all images in the connect
team of the unit specified shall execute a CLOSE statement for the unit
with the same status. There is an implicit team synchronization
associated with the execution of a CLOSE statement for a unit with a
connect team that has more than one image (8.5.3)."
