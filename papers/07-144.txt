[593]---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: In ``nesting of include files'' replace ``files'' by ``lines''.]

[594]---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Before ``the order of finalization...'' insert:]

o  the order of finalization of components of objects of derived type
   (4.5.6.2),

[Editor: After ``the order of finalization...'' insert:]

o  whether and when an object is finalized if it is allocated by pointer
   allocation and it later becomes unreachable due to all pointers
   associated with the object having their pointer association status
   changed (4.5.6.3),

o  the kind type parameter of enumerations and enumerators (4.6),

[Editor: After ``the positive integer values...'' insert:]

o  the allocation status of <allocate-objects> if an error occurs during
   execution of an ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement (6.3.4),

[Editor: After ``the value assigned to the <errmsg-variable>...'' insert:]

o  the blank padding character for intrinsic relational operations applied
   to objects of nondefault character kind (7.1.5.6.1, 7.2.1.3), [Notes
   7.27 and 7.42 -- where is the normative support for this?]

[Editor: In ``the kind of a numeric intrinsic...'' replace ``of'' by ``the
kind type parameter value of the result''

[Editor: Before ``the order of evaluation...'' insert:]

o  the character assigned to the variable in an intrinsic assignment
   statement if the kind of the expression is different and the character
   is not representabe in the kind of the variable (7.2.1.3),

[Editor: Before ``the manner in which the stop code...'' insert:]

o  how soon an image terminates if another image executes a stop statement
   (8.4),

[Editor: After ``whether particular control characters...'' insert:]

o  the form of values in an unformatted record (9.1.3),

[Editor: After ``the set of allowed names for a file'' insert:]

o  whether a named file on one image is the same as a file with the same
   name on another image (9.2), [Note 9.4 -- where is the normative
   support for this?]

o  the set of external files that exist for a program (9.2.1),

[Editor: After ``whether a unit can be connected...'' insert:]

o  the result of performing input/output operations on a unit connected to
   a file that is also connected to a C stream (9.4.3),

[and delete the similar but inferior one at the top of [595].]

[595]---------------------------------------------------------------------

[Editor: Some items near the middle of the page are not in order according
to the cited subclauses.]

[Editor: In ``the file connected to...'' delete ``to''.]

[Editor: After ``whether POS=...'' insert:]

o  the form in which a single value of derived type is treated in an
   unformatted input/output statement if the effective list item is not
   processed by a user-defined derived-type input/output procedure
   (9.5.3),

[Editor: After ``the result of unformatted...'' insert:]

o  the negative value of the {\tt unit} argument to a user-defined
   derived-type procedure if the parent data transfer statement accesses
   an internal file (9.5.4.7.2),

o  the manner in which the processor makes the value of the {\tt iomsg}
   argument of a user-defined derived-type procedure available if the
   procedure assigns a nonzero value to the {\tt iostat} argument and the
   processor therefore terminates exection of the program (9.5.4.7.2),

o  the action caused by the flush operation, whether the processor
   supports the flush operation for the specified unit, and the negative
   value assigned to the IOSTAT= variable if the processor does not
   support the flush operation for the unit specified (9.8),

[Editor: Before ``the variable in POSITION=...''; insert:]

o  the case of characters assigned to the variable in a NAME= specifier in
   an INQUIRE statement (9.9.2.14),

[Editor: Take ``with an I/O rounding mode of NEAREST...'' out and shoot
it, then replace it with

o  which value is chosen if the I/O rounding mode is NEAREST and the value
   to be converted is exactly halfway between the two nearest
   representable values in the result format (10.7.2.4),

[Editor: After ``the field width for the B0...'' insert:]

o  the blank padding character for nondefault characters (10.7.5) [Note
   10.17 -- where is the normative support for this?]

[596]---------------------------------------------------------------------

[Editor: In ``the file position'' insert ``an internal file of default
character kind or'' before ``an external''.]

[UTI 100 appears to heve been addressed; Editor: Delete it.]

[I can't figure out to what text UTI 108 applies.  There's no ``paragraph
above'' that appears to be relevant.  Editor: Delete UTI 108.]
