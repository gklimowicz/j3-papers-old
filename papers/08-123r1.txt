To:          J3
From:        Malcolm Cohen/Stan Whitlock
Subject:     Interpretation request on i/o specifiers.
Date: 2008 February 14


NUMBER: F03/0114
TITLE: Inconsistent restrictions on i/o specifiers.
KEYWORDS: I/O specifier, default logical
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

All of the i/o specifiers that return INTEGER values permit any kind
of integer to be used, even though this is likely to cause problems
with small integers.  But all of the i/o specifiers that return
LOGICAL values require "full-size" (default) logical variables, even
though every kind of LOGICAL can represent every LOGICAL value,
viz .TRUE. and .FALSE..

Should these be consistent, i.e. should every kind of LOGICAL be
allowed for EXIST=, NAMED=, OPENED=, and PENDING=?

ANSWER:

Yes, these should have been consistent.  Edits are provided.

EDITS:

Replace every occurrence of \si{default-logical-variable} in clause 9
with \si{logical-variable}.

Delete the BNF definition of and constraint for
\si{default-logical-variable} in clause 6.
