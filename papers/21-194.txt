Subject: US-26 Short Circuit Operators subsumed by US-22
Date: 2021-October-19

In WG5 N2170, Resolutions from the August 2019 Meeting in Tokyo, WG5
resolved: "US-22, replaced if necessary by US-26". US-22 is "Conditional
expressions. Permits conditional evaluation of parts of the logical
expression in an IF statement." US-26 is: "Short-circuit logical operators
(.ANDTHEN. and .ORELSE.)"

Since US-22 was completed (see J3 papers 18-274, 20-142, 21-157r2 and
21=162r1), the requirement was met and US-26 will not be further developed
for Fortran 202X. Short-circuit logical operators may still be useful and
should be considered for a future revision.
