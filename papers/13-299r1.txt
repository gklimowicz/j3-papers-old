Subject: For editorial consideration concerning DATA statements
Date: 2013 October 14

1. The problem
--------------

Subclause 5.4.7, paragraph 2, says "If a nonpointer object has default
initialization, it shall not appear in a <data-stmt-object-list>."

Consider the following definitions and declarations:

  type :: T
    integer :: I = 3
    real :: X = 42.0
  end type

  type(t), parameter :: P = t()
  integer :: A(p%i), I

1 data ( a(i), i = 1, p%i ) / 1, 2, 3 /

Statement 1 is prohibited by 5.4.7p2, but this is clearly nonsensical,
because it is not initializing p%i (which is constant).


2. Edits
--------

[5.4.7p2 104:7] Replace "object" with "variable".


3. Suggestion for F2015 Wart Removal
------------------------------------

NOTE: This is for consideration only if 13-353 is not accepted.

Requirement:
Require diagnosis of an attempt to explicitly initialize a
default-initialized variable in a DATA statement.

Rationale:
Processors are not required to report violation of this because it is
not a constraint.  This can cause delayed portability problems if some
processors ignore it as a convenient extension.

Specification:
Make the requirement, that a variable whose type has default initialization
is not permitted to appear in a <data-stmt-object-list>, into a constraint.

Syntax:
No new syntax.

Edits to 10-007r1:

[104:7] 5.4.7p2, delete.

[104:31+] After C567 insert new constraint
  "C567a (R536) A <variable> that is a <data-stmt-object> shall neither
         have default initialization nor be a subobject of a variable that
         has default initialization."
