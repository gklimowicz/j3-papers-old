Subject: Public Comment Procedures
Date: 2008 May 15

The purpose of this paper is to express J3's intentions
for the handling of Public Comments received concerning
the Committee Draft 08-007r2 of Fortran 2008.

This document contains steps of J3's internal processing
not useful to comment submitters, but useful to J3.

J3's process will entail:

1) comments should be submitted electronically to
              f2008-ballot-comments-ext@sun.com
2) comments will be acknowledged in a timely manner
   by an email sent to the sender (normally, within a business day)
3) each comment will receive a unique number which will
   be included in the response sent
4) the Public Comment will be posted to the J3 email list,
   and will be posted as a J3 meeting paper (the comment
   document will be in a format suitable for a J3 meeting
   paper, see standing document 013) with the subject
   of "Public Comment #" where # is the number assigned in 3)
5) at the end of the Public Comment period, a summary listing
   of all the comments will be made into a J3 meeting paper
6) J3 will process these comments at meeting 185 (August 2008)
7) responses to all comments will be gathered into a
   single document
8) the response document will be sent to all comment submitters
   and will be a J3 meeting paper

The use of a spreadsheet program may be useful for step 5) above;
in that case, the format of the J3 paper should be PDF.
