Subject:    Delete outdated material in Annex C
Date: 2015 October 13


Discussion:
-----------

Several explanatory notes in annex C are now 25 years old and are now
presumed to be obvious/uninteresting.  While their deletion is not
crucial, cleanup of this sort allows the Annex to remain more
relevent, and thus useful for its readers.
