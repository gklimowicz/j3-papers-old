Subject: Assumed-shape entities with NULL base address

INTRODUCTION:

The changes to CFI_establish described in 11-168r1 imply that
it is possible to create a descriptor which has the attribute
CFI_attribute_assumed and a base_addr with value NULL. This
is OK if the resulting descriptor can only be used as an input
for CFI_section or CFI_select_part.


EDITS to N1854:

[16:14-18] Replace the whole paragraph by

"CFI_establish establishes a C descriptor for an assumed-shape array,
 an assumed character length object, unallocated allocatable object,
 or a data pointer.
 If base_addr is not NULL, it is for a nonallocatable entity which
 is a scalar or a contiguous array. If base_addr is NULL, the
 established C descriptor is for an unallocated allocatable, a
 disassociated pointer, or is a C descriptor that has the
 attribute CFI_attribute_assumed but does not describe a Fortran
 assumed shape array. The properties of the object are given
 by the other arguments.

 Note 5.6+:
   A descriptor with attribute CFI_attribute_assumed and
   base_addr equal to NULL can be used as the argument /result/
   in calls to CFI_section or CFI_select_part, which will
   produce a descriptor for a Fortran assumed shape array."

{This also subsumes the changes in this paragraph from 11-168r1}.
