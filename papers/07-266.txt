NUMBER: F03/0096
TITLE: Can a read statement change the unit value?
KEYWORDS: Read statement, unit value
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:

Is it allowed to change the value of a variable which supplies the unit
number to an read statement?

Page 219:16 says the value of any input/output specifier shall not depend
on any input-item.  If you trace back, the unit= is a specifier in a READ
statement.

Note 9:40 on page 196 gives the example
         READ(N)  N, X(N)
and discusses how the changes in N work.

In F77 the similar example had READ(3).
In Fortran 90 this was changed to READ(N) (on page 126) and was normative.
In F95 the example was changed to a non-normative note.

The words prohibiting the example usage appear to be new to F03.



ANSWER:
Yes, the example is intended to be allowed as a backwards compatibility
feature.  Edits will be supplied to make this clear.
