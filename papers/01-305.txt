Subject: Interp 6 (Character length specification of a function result)

WG5 members in London considered Interp 6 and recommend as
follows. The HISTORY mentions the action recommended by WG5.

NUMBER: 000006
TITLE: Character length specification of a function result
KEYWORDS: character, function result
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM main
      CHARACTER(8) arg, func
      EXTERNAL func
      CALL sub(arg, func)
      END PROGRAM

      SUBROUTINE sub(arg, func)
      CHARACTER(*) arg, func
      CHARACTER(8) str
      str = func(arg)
      ...
      END SUBROUTINE

      CHARACTER(8) FUNCTION func(arg)
      CHARACTER(*) arg
      ...
      END FUNCTION

Some implementations error the reference to FUNC in subroutine SUB and some
do
not.  The implementations that do not error the reference to FUNC use
essentially the following as the argument for allowing the reference:

  The rules for when an asterisk can be used to specify character length are
  specified on in section 5.1.1.5 (middle of page 51 of the Fortran 95
  standard).

    * The first rule states that an asterisk may be used to declare a dummy
      argument of a procedure.  It is clear that FUNC is a dummy argument of
      SUB.

    * The third rule says that in an external function, the length of the
      result may be specified within the function itself with an asterisk
but
      if the result length is so specified, any invoker of the function must
      specify the character length of the function result as something other
      than an asterisk.  But the function that is being invoked in the above
      example does not declare its result length using the asterisk, so this
      rule does not apply.

Is the above sample program a standard conforming program with respect to
the
concept of declaring the function result length in the invoking program as
an
asterisk?

ANSWER: Yes. When item (1) on page 51 is applied to the argument func of
sub,
        it tells us that its length is 8 for the call from the main program.
