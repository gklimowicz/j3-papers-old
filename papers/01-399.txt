Subject:	Response to 357R1, Part 2.  Rewrite of 9.9
From:	Dick Hendrickson
Date:	December 6, 2001

In 357R1 Van proposed merging 9.5.3 into 9.9.  He gave edits to do the merge and also asked a few questions about what was intended.  This paper gives a final set of edits to accomplish the merge and also implicitly answers his questions.  Subgroup followed most of Van's suggestions, but not all.  Paper 393R1 shows what the final version of 9.9 should look like.  The 393R1 paper version and the .doc file uses different fonts to distinguish inserts and deletes; they might not show up in the .txt versions.
