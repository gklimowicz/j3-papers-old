TITLE:    Bounds remapped pointer assignment and ASSOCIATED
KEYWORDS: pointer assignment, bounds-remapping, ASSOCIATED
DEFECT TYPE: Error
STATUS:   Erratum

QUESTION:

Case (v) of intrinsic inquiry function ASSOCIATED [305:5-9] says

      If TARGET is present and is an array target, the result is true if
      the target associated with POINTER and TARGET have the same shape,
      are neither of size zero nor arrays whose elements are zero-sized
      storage sequences, and occupy the same storage units in array
      element order. Otherwise, the result is false. If POINTER is
      disassociated, the result is false.

This will cause the intrinsic to return false if the POINTER is pointer
assigned to the TARGET with bounds-remapping (POINTER and TARGET can be
of different ranks).  The same issue also exists for case (vii).

Is the POINTER associated with the TARGET if the POINTER is pointer
assigned to the TARGET with bounds-remapping?


ANSWER:

No, it is not intended that POINTER and TARGET are associated after pointer
assignment using a bounds-remapping that changes the shape or rank.  This
was a conscious decision made in response to a Fortran 90 interpretation
request concerning dummy arguments that are different shaped versions of
the same array in the calling procedure.
