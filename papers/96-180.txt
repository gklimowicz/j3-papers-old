                        Meeting 139 Minutes

Note:  The numbering provided in the minutes follows the agenda for sections 1
       and 5 and parts of some other sections.  All technical work performed
       during the meeting is contained in section 2.

1.1  Opening Business

     Meeting #139 of the X3J3 ANSI Fortran Standards Committee was held at the
     Sunrise Suites Hotel in Las Vegas, NV, November 11 through 15, 1996.
     Jerry Wagener was the Chair;  Larry Rolison as vice-chair led certain
     discussions;  Stan Whitlock took the minutes.

1.2  Meeting objectives (work plan) and Chair's report

     Objectives for the meeting were the items listed in the X3J3 work plan,
     paper X3J3/96-115r6, plus making arrangements for the February, 1997,
     joint meeting of X3J3 and WG5.  Miles Ellis, convener of the WG5
     ISO Fortran working group, was present.

1.3  Adoption of agenda

     Motion (Moved by C. Dedo; seconded by L. Meissner): adopt amended agenda.
     Passed: unanimous consent.

1.4  Review Meeting 138 action items

         o  S. Whitlock to communicate to J. Martin the questions X3J3 had
            about paper X3J3/96-121.
            Action:  done.

1.5  Secretarial arrangements

     The secretary for this meeting is S. Whitlock, who volunteered.  The
     secretary for meeting #140 (joint with WG5) will be L. Meissner, who
     volunteered.  The secretaries for meetings starting with #141 will
     be on a rotating basis, using a selection algorithm from L. Rolison.
     He has chosen to go alphabetically through the membership list so the
     secretary for meeting #141 is K. Bierman.

     The minimum contents for the minutes are who presided, who was the
     secretary, and all formal actions taken.  Anyone can request to have
     something placed in the minutes;  details of discussions will be in
     the minutes if and only if a scribe is appointed for that discussion.

1.6  X3/OMC report

          Brief report provided by J. Wagener.

1.7  WG5 report

     M. Ellis reported on ISO and WG5 business:

         o     SC22 approved the Conditional Compilation proposal as Part 3 of ISO 1539 (David Epstein project
          editor)

         o     ISO has always claimed the copyright on Draft International Standards documents.  Now it claims
          the copyright on all Working Group documents.  SC22 is opposed to this since it limits document
          transmission outside the Working Group.


                                                       X3J3/96-180
                                                       Page 2 of 23

         o     ISO is considering electronic distribution in 3 steps:  diskette, plus email, and then plus server.
          SC22 opposes the use of diskette and already uses email.  The copyright issue above may limit the
          usefulness of servers.

         o     ISO has removed generic Postscript as a distribution format;
          ASCII and PDF are allowed.

         o     The "old" rules for processing DIS ballots were to allow some "editorial" changes to the passed
          DIS.  The Fortran 95 DIS is being processed under these rules.

          The "new" rules will not allow any changes (maybe extremely minor typographical fixes) or the DIS
          is rejected and must start again as a Committee Draft (CD).  This means that the procedure will be
          to have 2 or more CD ballots with the last CD ballot clearly identified as the last chance to make
          changes.

         o     The Fortran 95 DIS ballot period is 26-Sep-1996 to 26-Jan-1997.

         o     WG5 has the following work items:

              -     Fortran Standard part 1 - Fortran 2000
              -     Exception Handling Technical Report (TR) - Proposed Draft Technical Report (PDTR)
               ballot has not yet started
              -     Data Type Enhancements TR - PDTR ballot has not yet started
              -     Interoperability with C TR - should have a document by the end of 1996 so a PDTR ballot
               could start in Spring, 1997
              -     Fortran Standard part 2 - Varying String Module
              -     Fortran Standard part 3 - Conditional Compilation

          o    The schedule for Fortran 2000 is:

              -     Technical work completed by Feb-1998
              -     Integration work completed by Feb-1999
              -     2 CD ballots
              -     1 DIS ballot

1.8  Treasurer's report

     Brief report provided by M. North.

1.9  Beginning membership report

     There are 19 members present.  Walt Brainerd (who had missed 2 of the last 3 meetings and thus whose
     membership was in danger) was present.  David Levine has left HP;  the new principal representative is
     Reva Sacks;  Rich Bleikamp will remain the alternate.  Visitor:  Miles Ellis (WG5 Convener).

1.10 Local arrangements

1.11 Comments from members

     Edits for the Minor Technical Enhancements (abbreviated MTE), as listed in paper X3J3/96-115r7, can
     either be deferred until the Fortran 95 DIS is passed or can be created against document X3J3/96-007r1.  In
     any case, the editor will not be updating the F95 document for F2000 until sometime after F95 passes.

2.0  Technical Work

2.1  F2000 Requirement R.1 Derived-Type I/O - paper X3J3/96-177

     Straw vote:  Should the user be allowed to define derived-type I/O in unformatted I/O?
               Yes=11, No=0, Undecided=5

     Motion: (R. Bleikamp/S. Whitlock)  Accept paper X3J3/96-177 as the functional spec for Derived-Type I/O.
          Passed:  unanimous consent.

     The I/O subgroup will consider extending derived-type I/O to intrinsic types (list-directed and NAMELIST
     I/O could be a problem).  The subgroup will consider at a later time whether all I/O within the derived-type
     I/O definition should be non-advancing.

2.2  F2000 Requirement R.2 Asynchronous I/O - papers X3J3/96-158, r1, r2, X3J3/96-164

     The I/O subgroup will roll option #2 of paper X3J3/96-164 into the revision of paper X3J3/96-158.

     Straw vote:  Spell out ASYNCHRONOUS?  Yes=4, No=7, Undecided=4
     Straw vote:  Use HANDLE= / use ID= / undecided.  1 / 10 / 6
     Straw vote:  Add an ASYNC statement?  Yes=6, No=0, Undecided=10
     Straw vote:  Now that we understand what the ASYNC statement is, add an ASYNC statement?
               Yes=15, No=0, Undecided=1

     Motion: (R. Bleikamp/J. Adams)  Accept paper X3J3/96-158r2 as syntax for async I/O.

         Straw vote:  Spell out ASYNCHRONOUS / abbreviate as ASYNC / undecided.  9 / 7 / 1
         Straw vote:  Should all variables in the I/O list be protected?  Yes=4, No=3, Undecided=11
         Straw vote:  Allow only PURE functions in any part of I/O list?  Yes=9, No=2, Undecided=6

     Vote on original motion:  Passed:  unanimous consent.

     Motion: (L. Rolison/C. Dedo) X3J3 communicates its work on async I/O to HPF and ask them to cease
          development of async I/O.  Failed:  Yes=3, No=11

     Motion: (K. Bierman/L. Meissner)  J. Wagener to communicate to HPF our actions on async I/O.
                Passed:  unanimous consent.

     J. Wagener circulated a draft of the message he would send to HPF.

                                                       Page 4 of 23


2.3  F2000 Requirement R.3 Procedure Pointers - paper X3J3/96-174

     Straw vote:  Like the concept of a named INTERFACE block?  Yes=13,  No=0, Undecided=3

     DATA subgroup will reconsider whether to add a requirement that procedure pointers should require an
     explicit interface; the current proposal has no such requirement.

2.4  F2000 Requirement R.4 Interval Arithmetic

     Paper X3J3/96-156 describes interval arithmetic in more detail.  Paper X3J3/96-065 was the preliminary
     specification.

     Paper X3J3/96-166 describes I/O of intervals.

     Paper X3J3/96-171 gives reasons why interval arithmetic should not be implemented as a module.

     Paper X3J3/96-173 describes how to make interval arithmetic optional.

         Straw vote:  Pursue interval arithmetic as an intrinsic data type where the processor may provide 0 or
                   more interval KINDs?  Yes=6, No=7, Undecided=4

     Paper X3J3/96-175 addresses intervals in mixed-mode arithmetic

         Straw vote:  Allow mixed-mode arithmetic of intervals with other numeric data types?
                   Yes=10, No=4, Undecided=3

2.5  F2000 Requirement R.5 Parameterized Derived-Types - paper X3J3/96-176

     Paper X3J3/96-141r1 passed at meeting #138 as specs.

     Motion: (K. Hirchert/R. Maine)  Accept X3J3/96-176 plus X3J3/96-141r1 as syntax for Parameterized
          Derived-Types.

         Straw vote:  Retain restriction that parameters must be declared in order of appearance?
                   Yes=5, No=5, Undecided=7

     Vote on original motion:  Passed:  Yes=13, No=2

2.6  MTE M.4 Specifying Pointer Lower Bounds - paper X3J3/96-154

     Motion: (J. Martin/R. Maine)  Accept paper X3J3/96-154 as the edits for MTE M.4.
          Passed:  unanimous consent.

2.7  MTE M.6 Extended Initialization Expressions - paper X3J3/96-165

     Straw vote:  Option #3 (plus all conversion intrinsics)?                Yes=15, No=0, Undecided=1
     Straw vote:  Option #4 (plus all elemental intrinsics except math)?  Yes=10, No=2, Undecided=3
     Straw vote:  Option #5 (include all elemental intrinsics)?              Yes=6, No=7, Undecided=3

     Motion: (L. Meissner/J. Adams)  Do option #4 as specs for MTE M.6.  Passed:  unanimous consent.

     Note:  Option #4 means that MTE M.6 will subsume MTE M.9 (allow MERGE in constant expressions)

                                                       Page 5 of 23


     Straw vote:  Create a MTE to allow a named constant as part of a COMPLEX constant?
               Yes=10, No=3, Undecided=3

     Motion: (L. Rolison/S. Whitlock)  Create MTE M.17 to allow named constants in complex constants.
          Passed:  Yes=9, No=2.  L. Rolison is the champion.

2.8  MTE M.10 Named Scratch Files - paper X3J3/96-169r1

     Motion: (C. Dedo/S. Whitlock)  Accept paper X3J3/96-169r1 as specs and syntax for MTE M.10.
          Passed:  Yes=7, No=5

2.9  WG5/Miscellaneous list of Fortran 2000 Requirements - papers X3J3/96-168 and X3J3/96-178

     Paper X3J3/96-178 records the straw votes taken on the requirements in X3J3/paper 96-168 that will be
     communicated to Christian Weber and the WG5/misc subgroup.

2.10 Interoperability with C - paper X3J3/96-153

     J. Wagener exchanged mail with M. Hennecke during the meeting, reporting that X3J3 suggests that the
     fewest restrictions be placed on the argument types.  M. Hennecke explained that "assignment of a variable
     argument list makes a true copy" meant that a copy of each of the args is made so after VB=VA, a callee
     can modify any of the args in its actual argument VB without affecting the args in the original VA.

2.11 Object-Oriented Fortran

     Tutorial by J. Cuthbertson - based on paper X3J3/96-114

     Paper X3J3/96-172 describes a minimal proposal for OOF.

         Straw vote:  X3J3 wants J. Cuthbertson to send paper X3J3/96-172 to the WG5/DATA reflector?
                   Yes=13, No=1, Undecided=2
         Straw vote:  X3J3 wants to keep run-time resolution of pointers in OOF?  Yes=6, No=6, Undecided=4

2.12 Conditional Compilation - paper X3J3/96-162r1

     Papers X3J3/96-160, X3J3/96-161, and X3J3/96-163 contain comments and responses on the CoCo spec.
     David Epstein received input from X3J3 on the CoCo spec.

3.0 Scribe notes for strategic direction discussion - paper X3J3/96-155
     Scribe Notes by L. Meissner

     Cuthbertson:  What is meant by: "We should consider canonizing compiler flags ..." ?
     A (Bierman):  At present, with each new version users have to change their makefiles or equivalent that
          specify compiler options.
     Cuthberston:  Then how can portability be achieved?
     A:  Use POSIX as a model.  Establish a set of flags that others may eventually adopt.
     ===
     J. Adams:  Content of the Fortran standard language should NOT be frozen after F2000.  New ideas will
          emerge that should be incorporated.
     A:  That is not being proposed.
     ===


                                                       X3J3/96-180
                                                       Page 6 of 23


     R. Maine:  Some additional objectives, besides those listed in 96-155, may be even more important:

       1. Expressive power of the language.  Some data abstraction improvements can be made that will improve
          this area.

       2. Evolution  - obsolescence issues: "never remove anything" vs. "clean it up as fast as possible".  An
          approach rejected a few years ago should perhaps be reconsidered: standardize a subset language.
          Such reconsideration should not necessarily be influenced by the current unstandardized subsets, whose
          objectives do not emphasize language evolution.

     J. Martin:  Agree that the objectives in 96-155 are too restrictive; expressiveness should be added.  We are
          now at a threshold regarding parallelism; Fortran's response must be as bold as its response in
          the 1950s to the assembly language crisis. Fortran must look to the future.

     R. Hendrickson:  Don't standardize a subset now.  There is still heavy use of legacy features, so they would
          have to be accommodated somehow in any subset implementation.  A standard without legacy
          features would be difficult to construct: During construction of such a standard, we would still need
          to consider how actual implementations of the subset will treat legacy features.

     ===

     K. Bierman:  The list in 96-155 was intentionally short to emphasize which objectives are most important.
          Is innovation the business of a standards committee?  Certainly not the central business.  Agree that
          innovation in parallelism is justified to spread costs.

          The focus should be on customer requirements as currently recognized.  Ultimately we are going to
          have the same interoperability issues that we face today with C.  That is, system interfaces will be
          defined and we will want to bind to them.

          8 years ago, had we been trying to add OOF, the logical contender would have been Smalltalk.
          5 years ago it would probably have been objective C and C++ (perhaps eiffel, but I didn't say it).
          2 years ago it would clearly have been C++.  Today it's probably C++ and Java.

          Had we been faster off the mark, we could have seen ourselves free to invent an object model.  But
          today is both too late, and too soon.  It's too late to be innovative, and too soon to recognize the
          sure winner.

          Efforts such as CORBA to bridge the gaps result in hideous interfaces that, to date, customers have
          largely avoided.

     ===

     J. Adams:  What ever happened to the "Core Plus Modules" model of the early 1980s?

     M. Ellis:  We have conflicting requirements: preservation of legacy codes vs. developing new tools to
          support new paradigms; meanwhile, a language can't keep growing forever.  Two possibilities that
          have been suggested are obsolescence and subsetting.  Or a totally new language, as once proposed?

     L. Meissner:  Perhaps Fortran can continue to grow.  Some vendors seem committed to continue support of
          old standard features as well as old vendor extensions.  Computers are getting larger and faster;
          word processors and other common software products keep growing at a faster rate than Fortran.

     K. Bierman:  In the long term, the problem is irreconcilable.  Some other languages have split into two

                                                      X3J3/96-180
                                                       Page 7 of 23


          separate standards.  The worst approach is to bury the problem with a compromise that satisfies
          nobody.  Two separate languages would be better than that.

     T. Warnock:  The needs of some users change very little.  Emphasis should be on satisfying the current
          needs of users, in ways that they can use to get good answers quickly.  Elegance is only a means to
          an end, and should not interfere with solving real user problems.

     W. Brainerd:  Keeping extra old features is not cost-free; may be partly responsible for the high current cost
          of Fortran compilers.  But removing a few little features every 5 years solves nothing and merely
          irritates users.  Maybe it would be better to start a new effort with new people.

     B. Runyan:  Why keep obsolescent features in standard?  Remove them and let vendors supply them as
          extensions.

     A (Warnock):  There are legal reasons to keep them in.

     A (Bierman):  The question is how old features interact with new ones.  These interactions need to be
          standardized.

     R. Maine:  Agree that a bigger language imposes costs.  Even if it is obvious that vendors will keep old
          features, we should not keep adding.  Keeping features in a standard is more expensive than
          permitting them as extensions.  Agree that deleting a few at a time is annoying and gains little.
          Maybe a split is warranted, but would have to be done very carefully, and would need to be done
          by a knowledgeable group, such as two halves of current committee.

     A (Bierman):  That would not work.

     R. Hendrickson:  Agree that deleting everything on current obsolescent lists would not significantly reduce
          the size of the language.

          Recent creations of X3J3 have worked well - X3J3 should not be restricted to "canonizing" existing
          vendor extensions.  Early language innovation came from vendors, but vendors are now creative
          only in areas such as command line flags; only X3J3 is looking at the broad language design
          picture.

     M. Ellis:  Current standards bodies have the momentum and long range perspective required for a continuing
          process.  The current "major - minor revision" model seems to require action too often: we feel
          impelled to do something every four or five years.

     C. Dedo:  We should keep in mind where we really want Fortran to go in the long run.  What should be our
          time frame?  I believe that it is the years 2001-2012.  What will the world be like then?  What
          features will users want?

          Please remember that the Fortran user community is large and diverse.  The users are not solely or
          even primarily those who create high-powered numeric applications.  There are many other
          application areas.  Some user groups would strongly disagree with the priorities listed in 96-155.

          We need to put much more emphasis on human productivity.  What is cheap?  Disk space is cheap,
          RAM is cheap, even compute cycles are cheap.  What is expensive?  People's time is expensive.
          Mistakes are horribly expensive.  So is ill will from customers.  Therefore, anything that we can do
          to make people more productive, i.e., allow them to create their applications with less effort and
          fewer mistakes is well worth doing.

     A (Bierman):  Other languages emphasize productivity;  this should not be a major criterion for Fortran.

     L. Meissner:  A major advantage of Fortran is the available safety features.  We should make them easier to
          enforce.

     T. Warnock:  For large users, our ambition always grows faster than our hardware.  Waiting for answers is
          not productive.

     J. Cuthbertson:  Our experience agrees with Bierman:  run-time performance and compiler speed are
          important.  Old features are wanted and must be supported, regardless of their standardization status.

     B. Kearfott:  Productivity has various aspects.

     Straw vote:  Remove the concept of "obsolescent/deleted" features in Fortran 2000.
               Yes=7, No=4, Undecided=5

     Paper X3J3/96-167 was available after this discussion took place.


4.4  Reaffirm/withdraw Fortran 90 (X3J3/96-152, 96-157)

     Paper X3J3/96-157 points out that FORTRAN 77 is not a subset of Fortran 95 so Fortran 90 should remain a
     standard so FORTRAN 77 programs will be standard-conforming.

     Motion: (S. Whitlock/L. Meissner) X3J3 recommends to X3 to reaffirm Fortran 90.  A roll call vote is
          required.

         Move to table until May-1997:  (L. Meissner/R. Maine).  Passed: Yes=12, No=3

5.5  Approval of meeting 137 minutes

D.2  Subgroups

Due the changing nature of work that needs to be accomplished as the committee moves into development of the
Fortran 2000 standard, work groups generally vary from meeting to meeting as the work load dictates.  The Chair
suggests work groups prior to each meeting and then the membership and responsibilities of each work group are
fine-tuned (usually dependent on the actual attendance) the morning of the first meeting day.  For this meeting, the
work groups were:

      JOR:       Responsible for the development and maintenance of the Journal of Development
                 (standing document 004)
                 C. Dedo, L. Rolison, B. Runyan, S. Whitlock (Head)

      HPC:       Responsible for numerical computing topics; in particular, high performance computing
                 K. Bierman, D. Hendrickson (Head), B. Kearfott, T. Warnock

      Data       Responsible for language design topics related to data and data structures such as
                 procedure variables and parameterized derived types
                 J. Cuthbertson (Head), M. Ellis, D. Epstein, K. Hirchert, R. Maine, J. Martin

      I/O:       R. Bleikamp (Head), W. Brainerd, L. Meissner, J. Adams
