NUMBER:  F03/0034
TITLE:  IEEE_LOGB()
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, logb()
DEFECT TYPE:  ???
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

What is logb(denormal)?  Is it of the hardware representation,
or is it as if the hardware had an unbounded exponent range?

What is logb(NaN)?  logb(-INF)?  logb(+INF)?

DISCUSSION:

logb() should be defined as if the hardware representation had
an unbounded exponent range.

logb(NaN) should be the same NaN; shall be a NaN.

logb(-INF) shall be +INF

logb(+INF) shall be +INF
