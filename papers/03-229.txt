Subject:  Edits incorporated in 03-007

This paper describes the changes in J3/03-007 relative to the
previous f2k draft, J3/02-007R3.  All page/line references are
to J3/02-007R3 unless otherwise noted.

Comments from the editor are in a separate paper; this one
is restricted to changes made.  It is my belief that the
changes mentioned in this paper need no action unless J3
disagrees with the changes.  In those cases where I believe
action to be needed, I have duplicated or elaborated on the
issue in the separate paper of comments.

This includes edits from papers (all 03-):

The character set example in Note 4.14 was also redone in an attempt
to use Japanese characters as in the f90 standard.

The following papers were done as is:

  103r3  108r3  109r1  110r2  111r2  112r2  114r1  115r1  116r2

  158r3  159r2  164r1  165+166R1     167r2  170r1  171r2  173
  174r1  176    179    184    186

The following papers were done with changes as noted.  The changes
were all pretty minimal changes, restricted to purely editorial items
such as punctuation.  Several of these "changes" are just explanations
how I interpreted vague or conflicting instructions.  I mostly avoided
technical fixups, even when I considered them to be "obvious"
solutions to simple oversights.

  paper 03-101r2
    [388:13] Duplicates edit in 03-188r1.

  paper 03-104r2
    [475:34] I assume you meant to keep the existing ", &" at
    the end of the line instead of literally replacing the whole
    line with this.  It would be nonsense if I did this replacement
    literally.

  paper 03-105r3
    [382:15-16] Also "provides"->"provide"

    [384:1-20+] The C_LOC in the editorial intruction here
    undoubtedly is a "typo" for C_F_POINTER.

    Slight overlap between the edits here and those in 03-107r2
    section 1.14 (passed as part of 03-171r2).  I merged the
    [383:2] edit from 03-107r2 1.14 into this paper rather than
    applying the edit and having this paper just override it.
    That edit delted a redundant "scalar" in item (3)(c) of
    the description of the argument to C_LOC (became item (2)(c)
    in the revised description of this paper).

  paper 03-113r3
    [53:22+] I wasn't sure where to put this.  Other previously
    passed papers deleted the constraint right before where this
    says to insert it and moved the subsequent constraint.  I just
    put this right after the ones added at [53:18+].

    [56:11+] Deleted "section".  ISO just uses the section numbers
    without any label.  In cases where something additional is
    needed for clarity, they want us to say "subclause" instead
    of section.  We call them "sections" informally, but the ISO
    term is "subclause".

    [433:37+] "Abstract Types" -> "Abstract types"

  paper 03-119r1
    [386:2]  Paper 03-120r1 has different changes to this same
    material.  The edits from 03-120r1 do achieve the same thing,
    in addition to other changes.  I used the edits from 03-120r1.

  paper 03-120r1
    [381:14] Corrected serial list punctuation.  (We use a comma
    before the "and" in lists of 3 or more items).

  paper 03-122r1
    Fixed data-component-part -> component-part
    Paper 03-166 changed this bnf term.

  paper 03-130r2
    [226:3-] We use numbered first-level items, not lettered ones.

    I assume that the second [226:3-] insertion goes after the
    first one.

    Two consecutive paras used different quote styles for the
    same strings (single vs double).  I changed them all to
    single quotes.  (Most consistent with other surrounding text
    would be to use no quotes at all, but I didn't do that change.)

  paper 03-138r1
    [53:2+] I assume both R442 refs are intended as R445 of 03-166,
    which is what R442 of 03-0007r3 turned into.  R442 of 03-166 would
    make no sense at all here.

    [398:28]  There is no 4.5.1.5 in 03-166.  I assume you mean 4.5.4.

  paper 03-145r1
    [432:37] 4.5.1.8 -> 4.5.1.1
    There is no more a 4.5.1.8; this is where most of the material
    from it went.

  paper 03-153
    Changed the period in the first "sentence" to a colon.  The
    colon doesn't work particularly well either, as there is an
    explanatory para between this "sentence" and the example, but
    it is better than the period.  We don't just put noun phrases
    in the document and treat them like sentences.

  paper 03-154r3
    [40:13+] It wasn't clear to me whether this was intended as
    a separate para.  I appended it to the preceeding para.

    [142:16] Paper 03-147r1, passed after 03-145r1, explicitly
    overrode this edit.

  paper 03-156r1
    My suggestion to put the new sentence at the end of the para
    instead of the middle was accepted on the floor, but doesn't
    appear to have made its way into the R1.  I did it per the
    floor amendments instead of per the R1.

  paper 03-162r2
    [111:4] This edit duplicates UK E3.  Fortunately, both edits
    are word-for-word identical, so I didn't have to decide how to
    resolve the conflict.

  paper 03-172r1
    [180:5]  This edit didn't say where on the line to add this.  I
    assumed at the end (no other place seemed to make any sense at
    all).  I also capitalized it.

    [392:26+] I guessed this was intended as a separate para, although
    that wasn't clear from the instructions.  I omitted the period
    before the xref; an xref in parens is not a separate sentence as
    this appeared to be trying to make it.

  paper 03-177
    [73:16-26] Changed the first "may be" to "is" and the second one
    to "are".  Paper 03-107r1 seems schizophrenic in that it
    explicitly changes 2 cases similar to this one way (19:23-24)
    and then makes 2 changes the opposite way in rewriting this.
    The "may be" is also inconsistent with usage in the other type
    specifier subclauses of 5.1.1.

    [83:10] This edit conflicts with one of some other paper.  That
    sentence isn't even there any more.  Didn't do this.

    [83:12] This edit also conflicts with one of some other paper.
    In this case, the sentence is still there, but rewritten.
    Didn't do this.

  paper 03-178
    [207:11-12] The word starting with "or" would be just "or".
    I'll assume that this really means the words (plural) starting
    with "or" as the 03-107r1 said (and continuing to the end of the
    sentence, which wasn't explicit in either case).  I also took
    the liberty of retaining the "to" of the original text so that
    we still have a parallel construct of "to x, to y, or to z"
    instead of the strange "to x, to y, or z".  (One could also
    factor the "to" out completely, but retaining it helps parsing
    here; incorrectly factoring it halfway out doesn't help anything).

  paper 03-180
    [267:16-17]  There are 3 occurances of "procedure" on these 2
    lines, though it wasn't hard to guess the 2 intended.  Also
    changed the articles as needed.

  paper 03-183
    E19 - Corrected serial list punctuation (twice).

    E20 made a wording change in two paras of 14.7.  Then E21 added
    a third similar para, but it used the original wording instead
    of the version in E20.  I have trouble imagining that this is
    actually the intent, as the same point applies equally well to
    all three paras.  I therefore took the liberty of also applying
    the E20 change to the new para added by E21.

  paper 03-188r1
    [262:28,263:1] Previously passed paper 03-138R1 moved and revised
    these words in such a way that the merge was not necessarily obvious.
    Therefore, I didn't do this edit.  It is possible that something
    still needs to be done here.
