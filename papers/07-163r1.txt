[17:13+] At the end of 2.3.6 Execution sequence, add "An example
illustrating normal and error termination of execution is contained in
C.0a."

[523:3+] Add the start of Annex C add

C.0a Clause 2 notes

C.0a.1 Normal and error termination of exection.

This code fragment illustrates the use of STOP and ALL STOP in a
climate model that uses two teams, one for the ocean and one for the
atmosphere.  

If something goes badly wrong in the atmosphere calculation, the whole
model is invalid and a restart is impossible, so all images stop as
soon as possible without trying to preserve any data.

If something goes slightly wrong with the atmosphere calculation, the
images in the atmosphere team write their data to files and stop, but
their data remain available to the ocean images which complete
execution of the OCEAN subroutine. On return from the computation
routines, if something went slightly wrong with the atmosphere
calculation, the ocean images write data to files and stop, ready for
a restart in a later run.
