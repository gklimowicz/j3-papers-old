  F2003 04-007, section 7.1.6 {126:14-19] says:

 9 A variable in a specification expression shall have its type and
   type parameters, if any, specified by a
10 previous declaration in the same scoping unit, by the implicit
   typing rules in effect for the scoping unit,
11 or by host or use association. If a variable in a specification
   expression is typed by the implicit typing
12 rules, its appearance in any subsequent type declaration
   statement shall confirm the implied type and
13 type parameters.

No further action will be taken on F03/0115
