Subject:    Absurdity concerning namelist comment
Reference:  16-007
Date: 2016 January 25

1. Introduction
===============

10.10.2p3 says a slash is a value separator.

10.11.3.6p1 says 'a "!" character after a value separator ... initiates
a comment.'

10.11.3.2p3 says "A slash encountered as a value separator during the
execution of a namelist input statement causes termination of execution
of that input statement...."

10.11.3.2p4 says "A namelist comment may appear after any value
separator except a slash."

10.11.3.2p5 says "Successive namelist records are read by namelist input
until a slash is encountered; the remainder of the record is ignored and
need not follow the rules for namelist input values."

If a "!" appears after the slash that "causes termination of execution
of that input statement" is the remainder of the record ignored
(10.11.3.2p5), or does an error condition exist because a comment is not
permitted after the slash (10.11.3.2p4), or is it OK because the input
need not follow the rules for namelist input values (10.11.3.2p5)?

The contradiction appears to be somewhat (errrm... completely) absurd.

Hopefully, an interp is not needed to clear this up.

2. Edits
========

[xvi: Introduction, under "Input/Output"] Insert a sentence "A namelist
comment is permitted after the slash that causes termination of
execution of that input statement."

{Maybe nothing is needed in the introduction, depending upon the thought
process applied to resolve the absurd contradiction.}

[274:28 10.11.3.2p4] Delete "except a slash".
