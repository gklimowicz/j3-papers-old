1. Discussion

7.2.2.4p3 [09-007r1:161:37-38] says "<proc-target> may be an elemental
intrinsic procedure even if <proc-pointer-object> is not elemental."

C1218 [09-007r1:289:26-27] prevents <proc-pointer-object> from being
elemental.

So 7.2.2.4p3 should end "<proc-target> may be an elemental intrinsic
procedure even though <proc-pointer-object> cannot be elemental."  It
should also say that <proc-pointer-object> becomes associated with a
nonelemental version of that intrinsic function, and which rank, but
that's a deeper question that is addressed by an interpretation
request.

2.  Edits

[161:38 7.2.2.4p3]------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "is not elemental" by "cannot be elemental".

Add another sentence at the end:

"If <proc-target> is an elemental intrinsic procedure,
<proc-pointer-object> becomes associated with a nonelemental version of
that procedure."
