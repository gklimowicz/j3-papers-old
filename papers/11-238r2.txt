Comment GB36 says that a note with a simple example would be helpful
for 5.3.7, para 2 of WG5/N1869. Here is a suggestion for that note.

At the end of subclause 5.3.7 of WG5/N1869, add:

NOTE 5.12
The following illustrates a C descriptor that becomes undefined after a
call to a C function.

     real ary(1000),b
     interface
        real function Cfun(array) bind(c)
           real array(:)
        end function Cfun
     end interface
     b = Cfun(ary)

\cf{Cfun} is a C function. Before \cf{Cfun} is invoked, the processor
creates a C descriptor for the array \cf{ary}.  On return from
\cf{Cfun}, the C descriptor becomes undefined.  Because the dummy
argument \cf{array} does not have the TARGET or ASYNCHRONOUS attribute,
all C pointers whose values were set during execution of \cf{Cfun} to
be the address of any part of \cf{ary} become undefined.
