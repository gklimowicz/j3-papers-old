DISCUSSION

In N1844, subsection for Page 16, 5.2.6.9, Aleks points out:

"A routine such as CFI_cdesc_to_bounds cannot be implemented in
general. It only works for contiguous objects, since strides do not
have to be integer multiples of the elem_length. Consider for example
an array of derived type and a data-ref such as
array_of_dt%integer_component. Depending on what the other components
of the derived type and the compiler aligment choices are, one cannot
reverse-engineer the Fortran triplets from the C strides. The routine
CFI_cdesc_to_bounds should be removed."

and Nick says in N1844 that he agrees. Edits are provided to do this.


EDITS to N1838:

[9:11] In 5.2.1 Summary of contents, para 1, at the end of the first
sentence, change
"CFI_bounds_to_cdesc, and CFI_cdesc_to_bounds"
to
"and CFI_bounds_to_cdesc".

[16:1-6] Delete the subsection 5.2.6.9 int CFI_cdesc_to_bounds.
