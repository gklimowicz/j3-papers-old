2 Questions without edits, Straw votes needed

[188:19-22] --------------------------------------------------------------
Was there a conscious decision taken that variables defined in more than
one iteration are undefined after the construct terminates, while pointers
whose pointer association status is changed in more than one iteration
have a processor-dependent association status? Could we make them both
either undefined or processor-dependent? If we make the pointers
undefined, we should say so in 16.5.2.2.3, not here.

Straw vote:  What should the pointer association status be
       change it to undefined
       leave as processor dependent
       undecided



[179:5] ------------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Insert "if that dimension of the <selector> has an extent;
otherwise that dimension has no upper bound" to take care of the
possibility the <selector> is a whole assumed-size dummy argument.]

[123:8+]------------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Insert a new paragraph:]
An <associate-name> that is construct associated in an ASSOCIATE or SELECT
TYPE construct with a <selector> that is a whole assumed-size array is a
whole assumed-size array.

Straw vote:  Should we allow assumed size arrays as a <selector>?
     Yes, add words as above
     No,  add a constraint
     Undecided


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

No further action:

[181:5] ------------------------------------------------------------------
[We don't usually restate a constraint within itself. Editor: Delete "the
<case-value-range>s . . . that is,".]    no, "overlap" is being defined here

[188:16-18] --------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Delete "A variable . . . terminate." because it's said at
16.6.6(16) which is the correct place

[189: Note 8.17] ---------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Replace "example represents" by "silly example illustrates".]

[192:10-11] --------------------------------------------------------------
Do we need to constrain against abstract types? If not, should we insert a
note explaining how pointless it would be?

-------------------------------------------------

Use syntax instead of constraint

[11:32] ------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     or <end-function-stmt>
