NUMBER: F08/0031
TITLE: PURE INTENT(OUT) finalization
KEYWORDS: PURE INTENT(OUT) FINAL
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider
  MODULE m
    TYPE t
      ...
    CONTAINS
      FINAL f
    END TYPE
    INTEGER :: fcount = 0
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE f(x)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(INOUT) :: x
      ...
      fcount = fcount + 1
    END SUBROUTINE
    PURE SUBROUTINE zap(x)                ! (1)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(OUT) :: x
    END SUBROUTINE
    PURE SUBROUTINE bad(y)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(INOUT) :: y
      CALL zap(y)                         ! (2)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END MODULE

Clearly, even though subroutine zap is pure, invoking it causes impure
final subroutine f to be called and so therefore it cannot be invoked
in any context that requires it to be pure.

Thus the call marked (2) is invalid.

The question is whether the subroutine definition itself (marked (1))
is standard-conforming.  If finalization of INTENT(OUT) arguments is
considered to be done by the called procedure, then the subroutine
definition is not standard-conforming.  If finalization of INTENT(OUT)
arguments is done by the caller, the subroutine definition might be
standard-conforming.

It would certainly seem a bit strange to be able to define a PURE
procedure that cannot be invoked anywhere purity is required.

DISCUSSION:

Although the phrase "When a procedure is invoked" sounds like
finalization occurs in the caller of a procedure and not in the called
procedure, being PURE or having a finalizable INTENT(OUT) dummy
argument are not grounds for an explicit interface to be required.

This would appear to require, as a matter of practicality, that the
processor performs the finalization of the actual argument on entry to
the called procedure.  I.e., that the impure final subroutine will in
actuality be called from the pure procedure.

ANSWER:

Allowing a PURE procedure to cause invocation of impure final
procedures in this way was inadvertant.  An edit is supplied to
clarify that any INTENT(OUT) dummy arguments of a PURE procedure must
not have a relevant impure FINAL procedure.

NOTE TO J3: This interpretation request has an interaction with
            interp F08/0034 (10-184).
            Care should be taken to keep these consistent.
(This note should be removed in due course.)

EDITS to 10-007:

[312:22+] In 12.7 after C1278, insert new constraint
  "C1278a An INTENT(OUT) argument of a pure procedure shall not be
          such that finalization of the actual argument would
          reference an impure procedure."
{In some other constraints we use "procedure that is not pure", but
 "impure procedure" is a simpler way of saying the same thing.}
