References: J3/06-101r1

The proposed edits for the CONTIGUOUS attribute (see J3/05-273r2) 
introduce the concept of a contiguous array but do not complete the 
integration process with C Interop. 

In particular, C_LOC should be extended to return the base address of
a (run-time) contiguous array pointer or assumed-shape array.

Edit for 06-007:

[475:19-28] Change the description of the argument for C_LOC to:

<<Argument.>> X shall have either the POINTER or TARGET attribute.  
              It shall not be a co-indexed object.  It shall either be
              a contiguous variable with interoperable type and type 
              parameters, or be a scalar, nonpolymorphic variable with
              no length type parameters.  If it is allocatable, it 
              shall be allocated.  If it is a pointer, it shall be 
              associated. If it is an array, it shall have nonzero
              size.
