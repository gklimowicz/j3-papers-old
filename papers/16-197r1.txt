========

[51:16 4.1.3p1] Replace "individual components" with "real and imaginary
parts" because this is clearer and more specific (COMPLEX not being of
derived type).

[52:14 C402] Delete "or component" because a component is an entity.

[66:0+9 NOTE 4.19 (cont.)] Replace "referenced the module" with
"accessed that derived type from the module" because referencing the
module might not be enough to access the name.

[75:15 C460] Replace "R449" with "R450".

[78:15 4.5.6.2p3] Delete the paragraph.  Finalization, in and of itself,
does not cause undefinition.  The sentence might be construed to imply
that, for example, a REAL array that is deallocated retains its
definition status, because it is not finalized.

[85:3+4 NOTE 4.63] Replace "enumerators cannot be represented" with "C
enumerators might not be representable".
