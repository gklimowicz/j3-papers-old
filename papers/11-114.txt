DISCUSSION

Requirement 8(c) in N1820 says that the lower bounds for an
assumed-shape dummy (or an assumed-rank dummy that is not allocatable
or pointer) are assumed to be zero, as opposed to the default of 1
in Fortran. Edits are supplied to state this and correct the
contradiction in 5.2.3 paragraph 2, which specifies a lower bound of 1.

EDITS to N1838:

[10:19+] Add paragraph

For a dummy argument that is an assumed-shape array or an assumed-rank
array that is not allocatable or a pointer, the value of the
lower-bound component of each element of the dim component of the
descriptor shall be zero.

[10:22] Change 'lower bound of 1' to 'lower bound of zero'.
