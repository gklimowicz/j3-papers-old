          Subject:  Issue 312 - Additional KIND Arguments

Issue
Paper 00-352 added additional arguments to several (12) intrinsic procedures.  This should probably
be noted in1.5.1 much like the additional intrinsics.  This could invalidate formerly standard
user-written generic extensions.  Not that I think it a big deal, but it is as pertinent as other
incompatibilities noted.

Analysis
  I agree.  We should add this feature as an incompatibility with Fortran 95.

Edits
  Edits are with respect to the 01-007.
          [3:16]    Add, at the end of the first sentence in the paragraph, ", and the interfaces of several
          intrinsic procedures defined by the Fortran 95 standard have been extended with
          additional optional arguments".

          [3:18]    Add, "or changed" after "new".

          [3:20-25] Delete the J3 internal note.
