Discussion:

The text in 08-007 at [215:12] refers to preconnected units on
different images. The current sentence, "It shall be a different file
from one preconnected on any other image." is worded as a requirement
on the user rather than an implementation fact.  Edits are provided to
correct this.


Edits to 08-007:

[215:12] In the last sentence of the third paragraph of 9.3.2 File
existence, replace "It shall be" with "This file is".
