1. Introduction

The description of elem_len in CFI_establish mistakenly uses "the type"
when a reference to the type argument is intended.

GB-063 is accepted as is.

2. Edit to N2146

18.5.5.5 The CFI_establish function, p2, elem_len,

Change "If the type is equal to" to "If \cf{type} is equal to".
