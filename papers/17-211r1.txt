Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~

For the function CFI_address from ISO_Fortran_binding.h (18.5.5.2),
[500:22-23] supplies restrictions on the subscript values. As worded
now, this excludes the ability to obtain a valid address if the C
descriptor is for an assumed-size array, because in that case the
extent member in the last array dimension has the value -1.

An edit is supplied to relax the restriction for this special case.
Note that addressing an array element outside the object is already
prohibited by [508:3-5].

Edit to N2137:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[500:22-23] In 18.5.5.2 The CFI_address function, para 2, subscripts,
after "of the C descriptor", add

", except that if the C descriptor is for an assumed-size array, the
 restriction on the value of subscripts[n-1] is that it shall be
 greater than or equal to the lower bound of dimension n-1"

where "n-1" (twice) is set in the same font as "n" in the previous
sentence.
