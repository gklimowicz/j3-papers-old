  There were some complaints recent on clf about the
  processor-dependent behavior of minloc and maxloc for
  zero-sized arrays (and for masks that are all false).
  Is there any reason why we couldn't define this result?
  A value of all zeros would seem an obvious choice.  Note
  the similarity to index, which returns zero in comparable
  situations.

  Edits:

    [308:14], [308:22-23], [311:18], [311:26-26]
      "the value of the result is processor dependent" ->
      "all elements of the result are zero".
