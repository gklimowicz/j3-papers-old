Edits for agreement of number
-----------------------------

[9.3.4.4p6 202:24]
Editor: Replace "data" by "a datum".

Edits for argument association of ordinary dummy variables
----------------------------------------------------------

[12.5.2.4p3 293:10-11]
Editor: Replace
"a default character or character with the C character kind (15.2.2)
actual argument"
by
"an actual argument of type character with default kind or C character
kind (15.2.2)"

[12.5.2.4p4 293:13]
Editor: Insert "of type" before "default character",
or replace
"default character or of type character with the"
by
"of type character with default kind or"

Edits for the ATOM argument of ATOMIC_DEFINE and ATOMIC_REF
-----------------------------------------------------------

We regularized the description of the type and kind of arguments, and
then ATOMIC_DEFINE and ATOMIC_REF used the old turgid style.

[13.7.20p3 332:6]
In the description of the ATOM argument replace "coarray or coindexed
object and of type integer" by "integer coarray or coindexed object".

[13.7.21p3 332:21]
In the description of the ATOM argument replace "coarray or coindexed
object and of type integer" by "integer coarray or coindexed object".

Edits for DIM argument of CSHIFT and EOSHIFT
--------------------------------------------

In the description of the DIM argument of the CSHIFT and EOSHIFT
intrinsic functions, the word "omitted" is used.  The correct word here
is "absent". Or... "omitted" was intentional and we didn't do anything
about the absent case -- e.g., disassociated pointer corresponding to
nonpointer optional dummy -- in which case we probably need an interp.

[13.7.43p3 340:10]
Editor: In the description of the DIM argument, replace "omitted" by
"absent".

[13.7.52p3 344:15]
Editor: In the description of the DIM argument, replace "omitted" by
"absent".

Edits for PRESENT
-----------------

[13.7.132p3 378:29]
In the first sentence of the argument description paragraph, insert "The
actual argument" before "A" so as not to lead to confusion when later
discussing the dummy argument A.

[13.7.132p3 378:30]
In the second sentence of the argument description paragraph, insert "or
allocatable" after "a pointer".  Alternatively, replace "be a pointer"
by "have any attributes" which covers pointer and allocatable and
anything we add in the future.
