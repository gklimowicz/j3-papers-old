As a consequence of interval work, we have discovered a number of
deficiencies in the base language.  Subgroup expects to continue work
in ferreting such out, and making appropriate changes to the
language. We propose the following subtasks to item R4 in the
workplan:

1. Possible "interline optimization" 
2. Possible addition of new characters to the Fortran character set,
   as suggested by DIN.
3. Possible addition of facilities to control rounding mode on a per
   operation basis.
4. Possible addition of facilities to control rounding mode in I/O.
5. Subgroup notes that lack of user specifiable operator precedence
   requires "excessive" use of parenthesis. Presently, parentheses
   specify grouping, and precedence is a side effect thereof. Thus,
   for any derived type, with companion operators, users will be
   required to use parentheses to establish precedence. But that may
   result in reduced opportunities for optimization. Research in this
   area will be undertaken, hopefully with a paper for our next
   meeting. We note that this is potentially  applicable to any
   derived type for which optimization is important. 
6. Possible constants for opaque derived types
