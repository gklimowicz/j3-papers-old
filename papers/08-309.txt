1. Introduction

This paper inserts a note intended to convey the intention of the language
design re calling type-bound procedures, as requested by Canada.


2. Edit to 08-007r2

[286:12.5.1 R1222-] Before the BNF for <actual-arg-spec>, insert a new note
  "Note 12.16

   When resolving type-bound procedure references, constraints on the use
   of coindexed objects ensure that the coindexed object (on the remote
   image) has the same dynamic type as the corresponding object on the
   local image.  Thus a processor can resolve the type-bound procedure
   using the coarray variable on its own image and pass the coindexed
   object as the actual argument."
