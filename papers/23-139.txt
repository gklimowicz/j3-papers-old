**-009 "Including an application domain in angle brackets is only allowed
        when a given term is defined more than once in Clause 3 to specify
        its context of occurrence."

Actually, the ISO directives *require* that the domain is specified when a
given term is defined more than once. They do not forbid it otherwise.

       "The content in angle brackets can be moved to the actual
        definition:"

It is not as simple as that - oftimes, that would turn an adjective into a
noun (and thus incorrect), or render the text unacceptably further from
being a "drop-in" replacement for the term.

Improvements will be made.

[5:16,16+] 3.12 base object,
           Delete "<data-ref>".
           Append new note
    "Note 1 to entry: this only applies to the data-ref syntax (R911)."

[6:3,4+1] 3.19 C address,
          Delete "<variable or procedure>".
          In Note 1 to entry, append to sentence
            "of a variable or procedure".

[7:36,36+] 3.36 conformable,
           Delete "<of two data entities>"
           Append new note
    "Note 1 to entry: this is a relationship between two data entities."

[9:31,32+] 3.59 descendant,
           Delete "<module or submodule>",
           Change "that" to "a".
           Before "or that" insert a comma.
           Append new note
    "Note 1 to entry: this is a relationship between a module or submodule
     and a submodule."

           That makes the whole item read
    "3.59
     descendant
     submodule that extends a module or submodule, or that extends another
     descendant thereof (14.2.3)
     Note 1 to entry: this is a relationship between a module or submodule
     and a submodule."

[12:13,14+] 3.80 host instance
            Delete "<internal... procedure>".
            Append new note
    "Note 1 to entry: This is only applicable to an internal procedure, or
     a dummy procedure or procedure pointer that is associated with an
     internal procedure."

[13:7] 3.88 inherit,
       Delete "<extended type>".
       The definition remains the same, viz
    "acquire entities (components, type-bound procedures, and type
     parameters) through type extension from the parent type (7.5.7.2)".

[14:7+] After 3.92 interoperable, insert new item
    "3.92a
     <C entity> equivalent to an entity defined by or definable by the
     Fortran processor"

[14:15] 3.93.1 standard intrinsic,
        Delete "<procedure or module>".
        Change "defined in this document (16)"
        to "intrinsic, and defined in this document".
{We only use this for procedures or modules, but allowing the term to be
 applied to types and operators is not harmful.}

[14:18] 3.93.2 nonstandard intrinsic,
        Delete "<procedure or module>"
{Same comment.}

[16:11+] After 3.110 polymorphic, insert new entry
    "3.110a
     polymorphic
     <function> having a result that is a polymorphic data entity"

[16:14] 3.111, preconnected
        Delete "<file or unit>".
{We could have a note saying this applies to files and units, but I think
 that is unnecessary.}

[18:30-30+2] 3.129, simply contiguous
             Delete "<array designator or variable>".
             Change "the designator" to "a designator".
             Append new sentence to note
        "Only an array designator or variable can be simply contiguous."
{Not sure we really need the extra sentence, but hopefully it makes things
 less confusing.}

Re 3.130, which reads:
    "3.130
     <array> total number of elements in the array"
Reject deleting the domain specification, because "size" is used with
multiple other meanings for non-arrays. Those meanings do not need special
defined terms themselves, but this one still needs domain restriction to
avoid confusion.

[21:10,11+] 3.146.3, parent team,
            Delete "<team except for initial team>".
            Add new note
    "Note 1 to entry: the initial team does not have a parent team."

[22:3,4+] 3.148.7, extension type,
          Delete "<of one type with respect to another>".
          Add new note
    "Note 1 to entry: this is a relation of one type with respect to
     another".

[22:13] 3.148.10, parent type,
        Delete "<extended type>".
        Add new note
    "Note 1 to entry: Only an extended type has a parent type."
