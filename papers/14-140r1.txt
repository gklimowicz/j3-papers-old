Subject:   Interp concerning LOCK_TYPE and POINTER
Date: 2014 June 26
Reference: 14-138, 14-139

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F08/0114
TITLE: Can LOCK_TYPE components have the POINTER attribute?
KEYWORD: LOCK_TYPE component, POINTER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Assume LOCK_TYPE is accessible from ISO_Fortran_Env.

QUESTION:

The following type definition and variable declaration are permitted by
C1302:

  type :: One
    type(lock_type), pointer :: L
  end type One

  type(one), allocatable :: L1[*]

C1302 requires a named variable of LOCK_TYPE to be a coarray.  C526
requires a coarray to be allocatable or to have the SAVE attribute.

The following declaration is apparently prohibited because L4 is
not a coarray:

  type(lock_type), pointer :: L4

Was it intended that pointer components of type LOCK_TYPE be permitted,
but that named variables of type LOCK_TYPE with the POINTER attribute be
prohibited?

ANSWER:

It was intended that components of type LOCK_TYPE not be permitted to
have the POINTER attribute.  Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

EDITS:

After C1302 in subclause 13.8.2.16, insert a constraint:

"C1302a A component of type LOCK_TYPE, or that has a nonallocatable
        direct component of type LOCK_TYPE, shall not have the POINTER
        attribute."
