Title: Clarify the "as if" rules.

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References:

Basic Functionality: Clarify that most of what is described in the standard
is what the effect of executing a program must, not that
it must actually be executed as described.

For example, make it clear that statements do not really
have to be executed in the order written (except for
transfer of control) even though that's in effect what
it says.

Rationale: People ask about this often, in places like c.l.f.
It would save a lot of time to make it clear in the
standard, rather than having to answer the questions.

Estimated Impact:  None, on the technical content.

Detailed Specification: Make editorial changes to clarify this concept.

History: Submitted as Pub-101
