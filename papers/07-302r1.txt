KEYWORDS: SIZE=, UDDTIO
DEFECT TYPE: Error
STATUS:   Erratum

DISCUSSION

9.5.1.14 [191:21-26] says that when SIZE= specifier is used in a
formatted input statement with explicit format specifications, the
variable specified in the SIZE= specifier is determined by the data
edit descriptors during the input statement.  These rules, however,
did not take into account the following situation where a parent READ
statement with a DT edit descriptor invokes a user-defined DTIO
formatted read subroutine that reads input data using list-directed or
namelist READ statement.

Consider the following example:

module example
    type A
        integer x(10)

        contains

        procedure :: readArray
        generic :: read(formatted) => readArray
    end type

    contains

    subroutine readArray (dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
        class(A), intent(inout) :: dtv
        integer, intent(in) :: unit
        character(*), intent(in) :: iotype
        integer, intent(in) :: v_list(:)
        integer, intent(out) :: iostat
        character(*), intent(inout) :: iomsg

        read (unit, fmt=*, iostat=iostat, iomsg=iomsg) dtv%x
    end subroutine
end module

program test
use example
    type(A) :: v
    integer countChar

    open (1, file='example.input', form='formatted')

    read (1, fmt='(DT)', advance='no', size=countChar) v
end program test


Note that there is no data edit descriptor in the UDDTIO subroutine,
readArray, to count the total number of characters transferred during
the child read.


QUESTION:

    Is this example intended to be standard conforming?

ANSWER:

    No, this example is not standard conforming. SIZE= specifier is
    not allowed in the example presented here.  Edits are provided to
    correct this oversight.

EDITS:

    [188:8+] In 9.5.1 "Control information list", after the list of
    constraints, append to the end of the first paragraph

    "A SIZE= specifier shall not appear in a parent input statement if
     the user-defined derived-type input procedure to be invoked
     performs either list-directed or namelist input on the same
     unit."
