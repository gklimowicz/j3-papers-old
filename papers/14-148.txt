Subject: Treatment of image failure in image control statements

Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~

[33:17-25] describes how image failure establishes the value of STAT
in image control statements. In line 21, the wording "in the current
team" is not correct because some of the image control statements
involve image sets that may be different from the image set in the
current team,

This paper suggests a fix for this problem.

EDITS to N2007:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[33:21] Replace "in the current team" by "in the set of images
involved in execution of the statement".

[33:25+] Add the lines

 "The set of images involved in execution of a FORM TEAM, SYNC ALL,
 SYNC IMAGES, or SYNC MEMORY statement is that of the current team.
 The set of images involved in execution of a CHANGE TEAM, END TEAM
 or SYNC TEAM statement is that of the specified team.
 The set of images involved in execution of a LOCK or UNLOCK
 statement is that of the team in which the referenced lock variable is
 established.
[[ may have LOCK( mylock[team::j] ). Problems due to locking across
   CHANGE TEAM context changes likely still present, though.]]
 The set of images involved in execution of an EVENT POST or EVENT WAIT
 statement is the set of images in the team in which the referenced
 event variable is established.
[[ similar argument as for locks. It may be necessary to remove
   EVENT WAIT from the list if it loses its STAT argument.]]"
