Subject: Issue 79 : copy in/out prohibition for co-array dummies
Reference: J3/06-007


Discussion of issue 79 (page 317)

There is no requirement for all images to be involved in a call to 
a procedure with a co-array dummy argument. This means that 
symmetric memory addressing would be destroyed if copy in/out 
were allowed. An extreme example is when the call is made on
only one image and this image accesses data on other images.
