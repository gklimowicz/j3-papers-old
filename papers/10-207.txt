Subject: Interop TR: Error for bad attribute in de/allocate
Date: 2010 September 10
Reference: 10-165r2.pdf

Discussion:

Proposed at m192 was a requirement that the attribute value in a
descriptor be for an allocatable or pointer object if the descriptor
is supplied to CFI_allocate or CFI_deallocate. It is already required
that the descriptor be for an allocatable or pointer object. Edits are
provided to require that the value of the attribute member be valid,
or the routine returns an error.

Edits to 10-165r2:

[12:6] In 5.2.6.2 CFI_allocate, replace the the last sentence,

"The C descriptor is updated by this function."

with

"If the value of the attribute member of the C descriptor is not the
attribute code for an allocatable or pointer object, no allocation is
performed, the C descriptor is not modified, and the function returns
a nonzero result. Otherwise, the object described by the C descriptor
and the bounds is allocated and the C descriptor is updated."


[12:13] In 5.2.6.3 CFI_deallocate, replace the last sentence,

"The C descriptor is updated by this function."

with

"If the value of the attribute member of the C descriptor is not the
attribute code for an allocatable or pointer object, no deallocation
is performed, the C descriptor is not modified, and the function
returns a nonzero result. Otherwise, the object described by the C
descriptor is deallocated and the C descriptor is updated."
