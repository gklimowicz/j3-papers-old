Subject:   Edit: Accessibility of a parent component
Date: 2016 February 10

1. Introduction

This clarifies that the visibility of an ancestor component does not
change just because you import the module that defined the ancestor
type and declare the type name to be PRIVATE.

2. Edits to 16-007:

[80:3-4] 4.5.7.2 Inheritance, paragraph 2,
  Replace "It has the accessibility of the parent type." with
    "If the extended type is defined in a module, the parent
     component has the accessibility of the parent type in the
     module in which the parent type was defined.".
