Subject: Interpretation request on INTENT(IN) and implied DO

TITLE:  INTENT(IN) dummy arguments and implied DO loops
KEYWORDS: INTENT(IN), implied DO
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS:
QUESTION:

The Fortran 95 standard [53:13-17] says
"Constraint: A dummy argument with the INTENT(IN) attribute ... shall not
             appear as
             ...
             (3) A DO variable or implied-DO variable,
             ..."

The apparent intent is to prevent any modification of the dummy argument;
however, use in data-implied-do and array-constructor-implied-do would not
modify the dummy argument.

Is the constraint intentionally stronger than necessary?

ANSWER:
The constraint is only intended to apply to implied-DO variables in I/O lists.
The following edit makes this clearer.

EDIT:
[53:17] Change "A DO variable or implied-DO variable"
	to "The <do-variable> in a <do-construct> or <io-implied-do>".
