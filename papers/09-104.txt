Subclause 4.8 [82:31ff] is entitled "Construction of array values."
Arrays are not types, so unlike descriptions of literals and structure
constructors, this subclause does not belong in Clause 4.

Editor: Move subclause 4.8 to [216:19-] (after note 6.17), making it
subclause 6.5.5.

While you're there, hoist the existing subclause 6.5.5 "Image
selectors," making it subclause 6.6: It has nothing to do
with arrays, so doesn't belong under Subclause 6.5.
