Subject: Missing constraint from GENERIC statement
Date: 2016 June 06

Reference: 16-007r1

1. Introduction

Fortran 2015 adds the GENERIC statement as an alternative to using
interface blocks for declaring generic interfaces. 12.4.3.2 (Interface
block) includes a constraint prohibiting naming a specific procedure
more than once:

C1209 (R1201) An interface-specification in a generic interface block
shall not specify a procedure that was specified previously in any
accessible interface with the same generic identifier.

but 12.4.3.3 (GENERIC statement) lacks a corresponding constraint. A
correction is supplied below.

2. Discussion

This is not really a technical change, as p1 of 12.4.3.3 says it specifies
the generic interface "in the same way as a generic interface block",
which does have this restriction, thus the text is currently
contradictory.

3. EDIT to 16-07r1

[298:4+, 12.4.3.3]

Insert the constraint:

"C1209+ (R1210) A <specific-procedure> in a GENERIC statement shall not
specify a procedure that was specified previously in any accessible
interface with the same generic identifier."

{Comment: Both the GENERIC statement and the generic interface block
 specify generic interfaces, see 12.4.3.5.}
