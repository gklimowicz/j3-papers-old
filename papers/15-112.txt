In UTI 011, the Editor quite reasonably remarks that every intrinsic
ought to have an example.  GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE doesn't.

The following is proposed as an example here:

{add an example}

[357:35+] add

"<<Example.>>
character( 1000) :: home_dir
call get_environment_variable( name= 'HOME', value= home_dir)
write( *, *) 'Home directory is ', trim( home_dir)"
