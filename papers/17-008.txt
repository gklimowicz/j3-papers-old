Subject: Editorial enhancements for future revisions
Date: 2017 March 10

This is the editor's list of things which have been and are being
considered for future Draft revisions.

Sections A and B are only used before revision of the 007 begins.
They are both closed during preparation of a revision of the standard.

Section A is for edits that were applied after the FDIS, and which
are included in the standard interpretation document that corresponds
to the current standard (for Fortran 2008, this was 10-007r1).

Sections C to E will become progressively smaller; suggestions that
are implemented will be removed from this document.


A. Post-FDIS edits that have been applied to 007
------------------------------------------------

This section is now closed.


B. Agreed post-FDIS edits awaiting action
-----------------------------------------

This section is now closed.


C. Edits under consideration
----------------------------

None.


D. Rationale for accepted edits
-------------------------------

None.


E. For future consideration
---------------------------

None.

F. Rejected suggestions.
------------------------

(1) [133:8] 7.1.1p3, make wording more like 2.4.3.3,
   After "Evaluation of an expression produces a "
   Change "value, which has"
   To "data entity.  The data entity has"
Answer:
   Use of the term "data entity", which can refer to practically anything,
   instead of the term "value", would be unnatural and lose specificity.
{10-214}

(2) [36:7] 2.4.3.4 change "rank" to "shape".
Answer:
    The shape of a function result is not necessarily determined by the
    interface of the function, so this change would be incorrect.
{10-214}

(3) [36:4] 2.4.3.3 Expression, change "rank" to "shape".
Answer:
    A disassociated pointer has no shape but does have rank, so this
    change would be incorrect.  As this is a brief introduction to what
    an expression is, a high level of detail is unwarranted.

(4) [c14] Investigate reorganisation of the IEEE module descriptions to
          make it easier to find and understand the non-procedure
          entities (including rewriting 14.9p1).
Answer:
    The IEEE subclause has had substantial technical changes already.
    Significant reorganisation would be inappropriate at this point
    (it may be reconsidered in a future revision).

(5) [10-007r1:441:17-20] Delete subclause 16.3.3 Function results.
Reason: This is because it duplicates 12.6.2.2p4 [307:13-21].
Note: This is subclause 19.3.3 ([515:16-19]) of 17-007, duplicating
      subclause 15.6.2.2p4 ([331:29-32]).
Answer: This subclause has been revised to be more informative.
