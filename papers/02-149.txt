Subject: ISO_C_BINDING Named Constants + Misc.

In section 15.2.1, the are some named constants defined in the
intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING (C_INT, C_FLOAT, ...), which, when
they have a non-negative value, are the kind type parameter values
that match certain C types.  But, when they have a negative value,
that negative value is not a kind type parameter, just an indication
that no interoperable type is available.  We refer to this collection
of constants as "kind type parameters", which isn't strictly accurate.

Edits:


[373:7]  Change "kind type parameters" to

         "named constants from the ISO_C_BINDING module"


[373:11+], in Table 15.1, in the column headings, change 

         "Kind type parameter" to the 2 line heading

         "Named constant from the ISO_C_BINDING module
          (kind type parameter if value is positive)"
