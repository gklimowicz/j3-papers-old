Here are some comments to Kurt's complaints (most of which I have heard before in one form or another in various discussions):

It cannot, so maybe the text that requires that should be modified instead.
Something like the value at the *beginning* of the execution...

If you look at my paper which made this "clarification of VALUE", you will see that I also agree that "value of" is not something the standard can really define because it depends on what the derived type actually represents (i.e. the abstraction), but it is not possible to fix this in Fortran now (or maybe ever). The edits merely try to patch the very *inadequate* definition of value of in the previous draft which did not at all say anything about the distinction between ordinary, pointer and allocatable components. The edits were not meant to provide a great new definition of "value of", as I do not know how to do that. At least implementors can implement the present text.
And the user who does your CALL SUB(X,(X)) and expects miracles will simply be reminded not to expect miracles from computers :-(

Best,
Aleksandar
