OpenACC Liaison Report
======================

Information about OpenACC, including the current standard document,
training materials, and upcoming events can be found at
http://www.openacc.org/.

The current OpenACC standard is version 3.0. Version 3.0 of the OpenACC
specification was adopted November 2019.  The specification can be found
at https://www.openacc.org/specification.


News
----
Mentor, a Siemens business, has contracted with the Oak Ridge Leadership
Computing Facility (OLCF) to improve the implementation of OpenACC in
the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

Oak Ridge scientists are also working to implement OpenACC in the open
source LLVM Flang compiler.

Applications
------------
There are over 200 applications in production or development using
OpenACC, including:
    - Code LEO (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
    - NekCEM (Computational Electromagnetics)
    - INCOMP3d (3D incompressible Navier-Stokes solver)
    - Cloverleaf
    - MAESTRO and CASTRO (modeling stellar explosions)
    - LSDalton (quantum chemistry)
And the usual suspects:
    - Gaussian 16
    - ANSYS Fluent
    - VASP 6
    - MPAS-A
    - COSMO
    - GAMERA for GPU
    - Quantum Espresso

More information on these can be found on the OpenACC
web site at https://www.openacc.org/success-stories.


Hackathons
----------
There are 2 more virtual "hackathons" coming up in 2020, where
researchers bring their codes to work alongside with OpenACC experts to
accelerate their applications. Event dates are posted at
https://www.gpuhackathons.org/events. (Applications for these is now
closed, though.)


GPU Technology Conference
-------------------------

The virtual GTC 2020 was held last week. Talks available on-line include:
    - Richard Loft: "Toward an Exascale Earth System Model with Machine
      Learning Components: An Update [S21834]"
    - Lionel Boillot, Long Qu: "Fully Exploiting a GPU Supercomputer for
      Seismic Imaging [S21451]"
    - David Gutzwiller: "Toward Industrial LES/DNS in Aeronautics:
      Leveraging OpenACC for Massively Parallel CPU+GPU Simulations
      [S21958]"
    - Minhao Liu, Deyi Zhang: "GPU-Accelerated Tabu Search and Large
      Neighborhood Search to Solve Vehicle Routing Problem with Time
      Windows [S21587]"
    - Jiri Krause: "Tutorial: Multi-GPU Programming with Message-Passing
      Interface [S21067]"
