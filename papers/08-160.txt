Discussion:

The second sentence of Note 4.50 reads

"A variable in a module or submodule is not finalized if it retains
its definition status and value, even when there is no active
procedure referencing the module or submodule."

This appears to be a relic of the old rules that allowed modules to be
effectively unsaved.  It is no longer relevant.

Edits to J3/08-007r2 (WG5/N1723):

[74:Note4.50] In the Note at the end of 4.5.6.4 "Entities that are not
finalized", delete the second paragraph that reads "A variable in a
module ... or submodule."
