UTI 097 (page 317) points out that there are many restrictions
on actual arguments that should also apply to the inferred
"actual arguments" from a defined operation.  That is
      call s(p,(q))
is the same as
      p = q
(assuming it's a defined assignment operation.)  The rules, as
stated, apparently don't apply to the second form of a "call".

The solution is to say that all of the rules for actual
arguments also apply to the inferred actual arguments in a
defined operation.

Edits:
[304:22] add at the end of the paragraph
" All restrictions and constraints that apply to actual arguments
in a reference to the function also apply to the corresponding
operands in the expression as if they were used as actual arguments."

[305:17] insert after "the second argument."
" All restrictions and constraints that apply to actual arguments
in a reference to the subroutine also apply to the left-hand-side
and to the right-hand-side enclosed in parenthesis as if they were
used as actual arguments."
