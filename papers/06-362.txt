Subject: Issue 88: CLOSE image control
Reference: J3/06-007r1


Discussion of issue 88 (page 198)

In the list of image control statements on page 195 the entry "CLOSE
statement for a file that is open with a TEAM= specifier" differs from
the other image control statements in that the qualification cannot be
determined at compile time.  As a result, a compiler will need to
treat all CLOSE statements as if they were image control statements.
It is a simplification to make CLOSE an image control statement in all
cases.

Edits to J3/06-007r1

[195:15] In the CLOSE entry in the list of Image control statements
(8.5.1) remove "for a file that is open with a TEAM= specifier".
