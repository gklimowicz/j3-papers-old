Subject: Interp. re assumed-type arrays
Date: 2022-March-02


The r0 of this paper addressed assumed-type arrays, thinking there was a
problem there, and assuming (contrary to fact) that we did not deliberately
permit passing scalars to assumed-type assumed-size arrays. We would not
have inserted those words if we had not intended it. This feature was
specifically requested by MPI visitors to the WG5 meeting in Garching 2011.

In fact this paragraph has problems dating back to Fortran 2003, which the
edit in r0 of this paper did not address. Following the spirit of the r0,
which merely asserted that a problem existed, I will leave construction of
the obvious problematic examples as an exercise to the reader.

As addressing these problems will require changing every aspect of the
suggested interp, including the title, a new paper will be constructed,
and will not be a revision of this one.

/INTERP therefore declines to accept this interp request as is, and
there will be no further action on this paper.
