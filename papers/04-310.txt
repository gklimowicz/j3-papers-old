NUMBER: F90/000140
TITLE: TARGET attribute for a derived-type object with a pointer
       component
KEYWORDS: POINTER attribute, TARGET attribute, structure, structure
          component
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: Section 6.1.2 (page 63) states:

   "A structure component has the INTENT, TARGET, or PARAMETER
    attribute if the parent object has the attribute."

A constraint following R505 (page 40) states:

   "Constraint: If the POINTER attribute is specified, the TARGET,
    INTENT, EXTERNAL, or INTRINSIC attribute must not be specified."

This would seem to imply that a derived-type object with a pointer
component could not have the TARGET attribute. Though it is
informative, Annex C.4.6 (page 267) contains the following example:

       "TYPE CELL
                INTEGER :: VAL
                TYPE (CELL), POINTER :: NEXT_CELL
        END TYPE CELL
        TYPE (CELL), TARGET :: HEAD
        TYPE (CELL), POINTER :: CURRENT
        ...
        CURRENT => HEAD"

which allows the static head of a linked list or tree.  Does the
structure component HEAD % NEXT_CELL contradict the text cited above
from section 6.1.2 or the cited constraint following R505?

ANSWER: No, the component reference does not contradict either the
constraint or the cited text from 6.1.2.  The cited text from 6.1.2 has been
clarified by F95 interpretation 000100.

Discussion: The constraints that follow a syntax rule, or a set of
syntax rules, are syntactic constraints and apply only to the syntax
rules they immediately follow.  Thus, the constraints that follow
rules R501 through R505 at the beginning of section 5 apply only to
those rules.  This means they apply only to type declaration
statements.  Since a derived type component is part of a derived type
definition (which is not a type declaration statement), the
constraints do not apply to derived type components.  The rule that
prevents an entity from having conflicting attributes when applied by
multiple specification statements is found in 5.2:

  "The combination of attributes that may be specified for a
   particular entity is subject to the same restrictions as for type
   declaration statements regardless of the method of specification."

EDIT: None.
