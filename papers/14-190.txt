From:    David Muxworthy
Subject: UK proposal UK-11 Assumed coshape
Date: 2014 June 11

Title: Assumed coshape
Status: For Consideration

Basic Functionality:
Allow a dummy coarray to assume its coshape from the actual argument,
similarly to the way that a dummy (assumed-shape) array can assume its
shape from the actual argument.

Rationale:
This would be convenient and there seems to be no technical problem
with providing such a facility. To get functionality in Fortran 2008
that matches that shown in the example in the edits would require
passing the coshape or working exclusively with allocatable coarrays.

Specification:
Add syntax for "assumed-coshape" that can only be used to declare a
dummy argument.  A dummy argument so declared assumes the shape
(but not necessarily the bounds) of the actual argument.

Syntax:
The syntax should be the same as for assumed-shape (but with square
brackets), i.e. each codimension is
  [ <lower-cobound> ] :
including the final codimension.

Edits to J3/10-007r1 (=N2014)

[93:18+] 5.3.6 CODIMENSION attribute, 5.3.6.1 General. Add to R509
           <<or>>  <assumed-coshape-spec-list>

[94:1-] 5.3.6 CODIMENSION attribute, 5.3.6.1 General, NOTE 5.8. add
new penultimate line:
   REAL :: A[:,:]             ! Assumed-coshape coarray

[95:14-] Before 5.3.7 CONTIGUOUS attribute, add section:
<<5.3.6.4 Assumed-coshape coarray>>
An assumed-coshape coarray is a dummy argument coarray that takes its
coshape from its effective argument.

R513a <assumed-coshape-spec> is [ <lower-cobound> ] :

The corank is equal to the number of colons in the
<assumed-coshape-spec-list>. If <lower-cobound> appears, it specifies
the lower cobound; otherwise, the lower cobound is 1.  If the lower
cobound is <d>, the upper cobound is <d-l+u>, where <l> and <u> are
the lower and upper cobounds of the effective argument.

[298:26+] 12.5.2.8 Coarray dummy variables, after para 2. Add paragraph:
If a dummy argument is an assumed-coshape coarray, the corank of the
actual argument shall be the same as the corank of the dummy argument.

[299:1-] 12.5.2.8 Coarray dummy variables. At the end of the secton, add
NOTE 12.34A
Suppose a subroutine for writing coarrays of a given rank and corank to
disk in parallel is desired. For rank and corank 3, the interface
   interface
      subroutine cafwrite(filename, coarray)
      character*(*), intent(in) :: filename
      integer, intent(in) :: coarray(:,:,:)[:,:,:]
   end interface
would allow code such as this
   character(clen) :: filename
   integer, dimension(nx,ny,nz), codimension[px,py,*] :: ca
   ...
   call cafwrite(filename, ca)
to invoke the subroutine. Intrinsics would be used within the subroutine
to determine the bounds and cobounds.
