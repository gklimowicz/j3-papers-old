The Editor remarks in 15-184 that material the introductory paragraph
of subclause 10.8.1 Position Editing is badly organized.

The Editor also remarks that the character string editing discussion
(towards the end of subclause 10.3.2 page 250) is archaic.

This paper attempts to improve this situation.

Edits

{edits are in page order}

{make character descriptor discussion singular}

[250:21] change "descriptors provide" to "descriptor provides"

[250:22] change "except for the characters in the character constants"
         to "except within a character constant"

{move T edit discussion to T, TL, TR edit subclause}

move [262:25-26] to [263:12+]

{move X edit discussion to X edit subclause}

move [262:27-28] to [263:21+]

{move Note comparing X and T descriptors}

move Note 10.23 to [263:21++]
