Subject: UK-3 INQUIRE RECL for unlimited records
Date: 2013 September 26

Reference: N1975, N1982

Specification: A standard-defined value is returned
when the maximum record length of a file connected
for sequential access is unlimited, or very large.

Syntax: no new syntax

Discussion:
I can find no statement that unlimited record lengths
give a processor-dependent value.  I conclude that
this is unspecified.  I propose that a value of huge(0)
(as suggested by uk-3) be returned when the maximum
record length is huge(0) or greater, or unlimited.

These edits reflect this interpretation.

Edits:

{specify a value for unlimited maximum record length}

[239:10]  After "file storage units." add a sentence
"If the maximum record length is greater than HUGE(0)
or is unlimited, the <<scalar-int-variable>> is
assigned the value HUGE(0)."
