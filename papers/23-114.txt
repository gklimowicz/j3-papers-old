NUMBER: F23/004
TITLE: OUT_OF_RANGE and ROUND argument
KEYWORDS: OUT_OF_RANGE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

In the description of the intrinsic function

    OUT_OF_RANGE (X, MOLD [, ROUND])

it states "ROUND shall be present only if X is of type real and
           MOLD is of type integer."

Consider

    Program test
        Call s(1.5,2.5)
    Contains
        Subroutine s(x,y,r)
            Logical,Optional :: r
            Print *,out_of_range(x,y,r) ! Valid?
        End Subroutine
    End Program

As R is an optional dummy argument, it is present only if the actual
argument is present. In this example, R is not present, and so the
requirement in 16.9.157 is satisfied.

Was it intended that this program be valid?
(Of the two compilers that implement OUT_OF_RANGE that I tested,
 both of them rejected the program.)

ANSWER:

No, it was not intended that the example be valid; the requirement
should have stated that the argument shall not appear.

An edit is provided.

EDIT to N2209.

[422] 16.9.157 OUT_OF_RANGE, Arguments paragraph, ROUND argument,
      change "shall be present only" to "shall appear only".
