Subject: UK proposal UK-15 GENERIC stmt as alternative to interface block
Date: 2014 June 09

Status: For Consideration

Comment: This is US-06 from N1982 which was "subject to WG5 review in
2014".  The BSI panel endorses this proposal.  A somewhat similar
proposal was made by Espen Myklebust.  The following is copied from
J3/13-209 except that page and line references to 14-007r1 have been
added (specified subclause numbers have not changed between 10-007r1
and 14-007r1)

Basic functionality: Allow a GENERIC statement as an alternative to an
interface block, with syntax similar to its use within a type
definition.

Rationale: Reduces the number of statements, and thereby long-term cost.

Estimated impact: Minor

Markham M6 conformance: Remove simple deficiency and discrepancy.

Detailed specification: Allow a GENERIC statement as an alternative to
an interface block, with syntax similar to its use within a type
definition.

Draft edits: To estimate scope of project

[30:21+] In subclause 2.1 add an alternative to R207
<declaration-construct>

                <<or>> <generic-stmt>

[280:22] In subclause 12.4.3.2 replace <procedure-name-list> in R1206
with <specific-procedure-list>

[280:22+] Insert new syntax rule

R1206a <specific-procedure> <<is>> <procedure-name>

[281:8] Change the reference in C1207 to refer to R1206a.

[282:1-] Insert subclause 12.4.3.2a after subclause 12.4.3.2

<<12.4.3.2a GENERIC statement>>

A GENERIC statement specifies a generic identifier for one or more
specific procedures, in the same way as a generic interface block that
does not contain interface bodies.

R1208a <generic-stmt> <<is>> GENERIC [, <access-spec> ] ::
                             <generic-spec> => <specific-procedure-list>

If <access-spec> appears, it specifies the accessibility (5.3.2) of
<generic-spec>.

[284:5] Insert a sentence in 12.4.3.4.1p1 before the final sentence:
"A GENERIC statement specifies a generic interface for each of the
procedures named in its <specific-procedure-list>."

[284:6] Insert a sentence after the first sentence of 12.4.3.4.1p2:  "The
<generic-spec> in a GENERIC statement is a generic identifier for all of
the procedures named in its <specific-procedure-list>."
