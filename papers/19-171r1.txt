Original R0 material
====================

The 24th edition of Ada-Europe's International Conference on Reliable
Software Technologies took place on 11-14 June in Warsaw, Poland, with
considerable success.

The conference, graciously hosted by the Institute of Aviation, had
nearly 100 participants, enjoyed a rich technical and social program,
and saw much active interaction between participants, presenters,
and exhibitors.

For your information, the following material is now available online:
- the "Conference Booklet" in PDF, which contains the abstracts of all
  presentations in the core program (see first section on [1]);
- copies of conference presentations
  (see "Download" links in "Conference Core Schedule" table on [1]);
- copies of DeCPS workshop presentations
  (see "Download links in "Program" table on [2]);
- pictures of the exhibition booths (see final part of [3]).

As announced in Warsaw, next year's conference will be held in
Santander, Spain, in the week of 8-12 June 2020.

The preliminary Call for Contributions is already available on the
(mini) conference web site at [4].  More details will follow later.

On this occasion, the Ada-Europe Board announces a slight update of
the name of its conference series:
- the complete name is "25th Ada-Europe International Conference on
   Reliable Software Technologies";
- the short name is "Ada-Europe Conference 2020";
- the acronym is "AEiC 2020".

Hence on social media when referring to the Ada-Europe organization
we'll use #AdaEurope, and when referring to next year's Ada-Europe
Conference we'll use #AEiC2020.

One of the keynotes at the recent Ada-Europe Conference 2019 in
Warsaw gave an overview of the new features in the upcoming revision
of the Ada programming language.  The slides of that presentation
are available at

Further to this we are pleased to distribute an announcement from
the ISO/IEC working group on the Ada programming language about an
additional comment period for the upcoming Ada revision: see below.

Subject: Additional Comment Period for Upcoming Ada Revision
Date: Fri, 26 Jul 2019 21:53:30 -0500

ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 9 (WG 9) is responsible for the maintenance
and revision of the Ada Programming Language and associated standards
and technical reports.  As part of the language maintenance activity,
WG 9 has established a group of Ada experts as the Ada Rapporteur
Group (ARG).  The ARG receives input from the Ada community at
large to consider for inclusion in revision to the Ada programming
language standard.  The WG 9 has produced a number of revisions to the
language in accordance with ISO policy and to address the evolution
of technology (Ada 83, Ada 95, Ada 2005, Ada 2012).

Presently, the ARG is nearing completion on a revision to Ada
2012 (known for now as Ada 202x) which includes new contracts and
lightweight parallelism features.  Concern has been raised that these
new proposals have not been prototyped nor has the suitability for
diverse target environments been assessed.

Therefore, the ARG is seeking comments, based on prototyping and
review, on the new features (focused on the parallelism features)
incorporated within the current draft of the Ada 202X standard.
Comments should be submitted to ada-comment@ada-auth.org
as described in the Ada Reference Manual Introduction
(http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rm12_w_tc1/html/RM-0-3.html#p58).
Please include the draft number with any Ada Reference Manual
references in your comment.  Comments should be sent by 1
June 2020 in order to be considered for the revision.  (Note:
While not required, joining the mailing list as described at
http://www.ada-auth.org/comment.html is recommended so that you
receive any queries on or responses to your comment.)

The draft revision can be found at
http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/ada2x.html.
A list of issues addressed in Ada 202x can be found at
http://www.ada-auth.org/ai-files/grab_bag/2020-Amendments.html.

To translate this announcement into plain English, the completion
date of Ada 202x has been pushed back a year and a half in order
to get more feedback on the proposed changes.  Most of the major
features went from rough outlines last fall to a completed standard
with detailed wording by May.  This rate of completion was just too
much for most interested parties outside of the ARG to keep up with.

Rather than standardize something under-baked that might have to be
changed in a few years, we're dialing back the amount of work and
letting the Ada community catch up.

This comment period is not intended to introduce additional new
features; such comments are always welcome but most will be deferred
until the following revision.  (Of course, additional features related
to the ones already intended for the revision are possible.)

                                       Randy.
