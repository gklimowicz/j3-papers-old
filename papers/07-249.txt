NUMBER:   F03/0094
TITLE:    Final subroutine and VALUE attribute
KEYWORDS: Final subroutine, VALUE
DEFECT TYPE: Error
STATUS:   Erratum


QUESTION:

Currently, the F03 standard allows VALUE attribute to be specified
for the dummy argument of final subroutines.  This seems defeat the
purpose of final subroutine, which is intended to apply to the
finalizable entity (the actual argument) itself.

Should dummy argument of a final subroutine be allowed to have VALUE
attribute?


ANSWER:

No, VALUE attribute is not allowed.
An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

EDITS to 04-007:

[58:14] Replace "be INTENT(OUT)." with "be specified with INTENT(OUT) or
VALUE attribute."
