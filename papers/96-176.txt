Subject: Syntax for Parameterized Derived Types (R.5)

The syntax for parameterized derived types is as the illustrative
syntax given in 96-141r1 except:

    *  Any type parameters that are explicitly declared shall be
       declared in the order in which they appear in the parameter
       list on the type statement, and they shall preceed any
       component declarations.

          Example:

          type matrix (kind, dim)
              integer, kind :: kind
              integer, no_kind :: dim
              real(kind) :: element(dim, dim)
         end type

    *  The syntax for the constructor has changed with the type
       parameters given in one parenthesized list, followed by a
       separate parenthesized list containing the initialization
       values.

         Example:

         type(matrix(kind=4, dim=1000)) :: A

         A = matrix(kind=4, dim=1000) ((/.../))
