Subj:  Comments/Questions on chapters 1-7 of 01-007R2

I have the following questions/comments about chapters 1 through 7 of
01-007R2:

[41:24-25]  these two lines are part of constraint C445 and should
            be indented, right?

[80:46]  delete "If a"

[89:41]  what is the syntax term "<proc-pointer-name>"?  the name of a
         "<proc-pointer>"?  which is a "procedure pointer"?  so where
         is that defined?

[89:42]  should "or <proc-pointer-name>" be inserted before "is"?

[119:38]  should line 35 be inserted into note 7.22 after line 38 and
          the notes 7.21 and 7.22 be merged together?
