Discussion

The editor remarks that there can be no operations defined by
intrinsic functions. While this is true for Fortran operations,
it is not so for the operations of the IEEE standard. Section 5
of the IEEE standard states
   "All conforming implementations of this standard shall provide
   operations to add, subtract, multiply, divide, extract the square
   root, find the remainder, round to integer in floating-point format,
   convert between different floating-point formats, convert between
   floating-point and integer formats, convert binary <-> decimal, and
   compare."
Edits are provided to make this clear.

The editor also says that it would help to know exactly which
specifications are involved. We agree and propose the addition of a
note.


Edits to 07-007r3

[437:4-6,8-10,12-14] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, delete the second
sentence in each of paragraphs 4-6.

[437:14+] Insert a new paragraph:

   "For each kind of real for which IEEE NaNs, IEEE infinities, or IEEE
   denormals are supported, their behavior for the unary and binary
   operations specified in Section 5 of the IEEE International Standard,
   including those provided by intrinsic functions and by functions in
   intrinsic modules, shall conform to the specifications in the IEEE
   International Standard".

[437:14+] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, after paragraph 6, add

   "NOTE 14.7a
   The operations specified in Section 5 of the IEEE International
   Standard are add, subtract, multiply, divide, extract the square root,
   find the remainder, round to integer in floating-point format, convert
   between different floating-point formats, convert between
   floating-point and integer formats, convert binary <-> decimal, and
   compare."

Note to editor: The 1985 IEEE standard uses "<->", not "between... and..."
or a double-arrow symbol.
