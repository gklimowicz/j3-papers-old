Subject: Interpretation request concerning VALUE, INTENT and PURE

NUMBER: F03/0082
TITLE: VALUE in place of INTENT for pure procedure dummy arguments
KEYWORDS: VALUE, INTENT, PURE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: 

QUESTION:

C1266 requires all nonpointer dummy arguments of a pure function to be
data objects that have INTENT(IN).  C1267 requires all dummy arguments of
a pure subroutine to have specified intents.

Was it intended that VALUE not be allowed in place of INTENT(IN), that is,
was it intended that if a dummy argument of a pure procedure has the VALUE
attribute, it is nonetheless also required to have the INTENT(IN)
attribute explicitly specified?

ANSWER:

It was an oversight that VALUE is not allowed to stand on its own.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[286:12] at the end of C1266, add "or the VALUE attribute".

[286:13-14] Replace C1277:

C1277 Within the <specification-part> of a pure subroutine subprogram,
      for each dummy data object, either its intent shall be explicitly
      specified, or it shall have the VALUE attribute.
