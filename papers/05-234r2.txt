1. Summary:
-----------

Relax the restriction on the maximum rank of an array.

2. Specification:
-----------------

Increase the maximum rank for an object to 15;
in the presence of co-arrays, the sum of the rank
and co-rank shall be less than or equal to 15.

3. EDITS to 04-007:
-------------------

In the Introduction section (page xiii), the list of new Fortran 
2008 features should include

  "The maximum rank of an array has been increased from seven to fifteen."

{This is true whether or not co-arrays are present.}

18:5. In subsection 2.4.5, Array, in the first line of the second
paragraph, change "seven" to "fifteen".

In 5.1.2.5 DIMENSION attribute, first constraint C541 [78:14], replace
"seven" with "fifteen", making the whole constraint:
  "C541 (R510) The maximum rank is fifteen."

In 6.2.2.2 Array element order, Table 6.1  [108:6+],
  In the second to bottom box:
    In the "Rank" column, change "7" to "15"
    In the Subscript bounds column, change the subscripts on the final
      j and k from "7" to "15"
    In the Subscript list column, change the subscript on the final s
      from "7" to "15"
    In the Subscript order value column, in the fifth line, change the
      subscripts on s and j from "7" to "15", and the subscript on d
      from "6" to "14"; in the sixth line, change the subscript on the
      first d from "5" to "13".
  In the bottom (Notes) box, in the last line, change "7" to "15".

In 13.7.144 SPREAD, "Arguments" paragraph, SOURCE argument, last
sentence [353:19], change "less than 7" to "less than 15".

4. Sample EDITS for co-array integration:
-----------------------------------------

18:20+. At the end of the section 2.4.5+ added by 05-209, add:
  "The sum of the rank and co-rank of an object may be up to fifteen."

In 5.1.2.5 DIMENSION attribute, first constraint C541 [78:14], delete
the BNF reference and replace the text with
  "The sum of the rank and co-rank shall not exceed fifteen."

353:19.  Replace the last sentence of the description of the 
SOURCE argument with:
  "The sum of the rank and co-rank of SOURCE shall be less than 15."
