Subject: Subobject designators in namelist output

NUMBER: F03/0128
TITLE: Subobjects in namelist output
KEYWORDS: NAMELIST
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Was it intended to disallow vendors to provide namelist output that
includes a subobject designator followed by a value?

ANSWER:

Yes.  The processor is required to produce output in the form
specified by 10.11.4.3 "Namelist output records".

10.11.4.3 paragraph 2 states
  "The name of each namelist group object list item is placed in the
   output record followed by an equals and a list of values of the
   namelist group object list item."

This unambiguously states that each namelist group object list item
(these are the ones listed in NAMELIST statements) have their names
placed in the output record followed by an equals sign and the list
of their values.  Subobject designators do not appear in NAMELIST
statements.

EDIT:

None.
