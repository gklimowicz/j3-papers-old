DISCUSSION:

It seems that N1723 allows an allocatable coarray to be associated
with a non-coarray allocatable dummy. Consider the following sample
program

real, allocatable :: x(:)[:]
call sub (x)                  !<-- this should be disallowed
...
subroutine sub (y)
  real, allocatable :: y(:)
...
end subroutine

Since subroutine sub expects a non-coarray allocatable dummy, it could
allocate or deallocate the dummy argument. However, the corresponding
actual argument is a coarray; allocation or deallocation of it
involves implicit synchronization. This call should not be allowed.

EDITS to J3/08-007r2:

[292:12.5.2.6p2+] After the second paragraph of 12.5.2.6 "Allocatable
      dummy variables", insert a new paragraph:

"The corank of the actual argument shall be the same as that of the
dummy argument."

[292:12.5.2.8] Replace the title of 12.5.2.8 "Coarray arguments" with
"Coarray dummy variables".

[292:12.5.2.8p1] Delete the second sentence of 12.5.2.8 which reads
"If the dummy argument is an allocatable coarray, ... same rank and
corank."
