1. Introduction

Paper 99-108r1 introduced some new terminology.  Issue 195 points out the
lack
of a definition for the term "executable scoping unit".  The J3 internal
note
appears in section 5.1.2.5 "SAVE attribute", but the same term appears in
section 5.3.4 "SAVE statement".

The definition for "scoping unit" is

   1) a derived-type definition
   2) an interface body, excluding any derived-type definitions and
interface
      bodies in it
   3) a program unit or subprogram, excluding derived-type definitions,
      interface bodies, and subprograms in it

where a program unit is

   1) main program
   2) module
   3) external subprogram
   4) block data program unit

Clearly it was intended that derived-type definitions, interface bodies,
modules, and block data program units be excluded from "executable scoping
units"; however, subprograms in modules and internal subprograms should be
included.

This issue was studied at the WG5 meeting in Cadarache and the subgroup felt
that because the term appears in several places, the definition should
appear
earlier in the standard in section 2 (and in the glossary).  The following
edits
accomplish this.

2. Edits

{Add a definition to section 2.2 Program unit concepts.}
[12:6+] An <<executable scoping unit>> is a scoping unit that contains
executable statements (2.3.1); it is a main program or subprogram excluding
any
subprograms within it.

{Incidental edit}
[13:25] (Delete redundant period at end of line.)

(Add definition to glossary.)
[[418:8+] <<executable scoping unit>> (2.2): A scoping unit that contains
executable statements (2.3.1).  It is a main program or subprogram excluding
any
subprograms within it.

3. Other Considerations

Are the references to instances being the "direct or indirect result" of
other
instances clear? (5.1.2.5 and 5.3.4)

It is proposed that part of 99-108r1 be excised from the draft standard.
Some
of the resulting edits to J3/99-007r1 (such as the ones to sections 5.1.2.5
and
5.3.4) attempted to clean up the text.  Should we retain these or revert to
the
text in J3/99-007?  These particular edits have nothing to do with the
addition
of INITIAL and FINAL to the draft, but do improve the clarity.
