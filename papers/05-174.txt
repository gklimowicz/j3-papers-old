QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      MODULE m
        PRIVATE
        TYPE, PUBLIC :: t
          INTEGER :: i
          INTEGER :: j
        CONTAINS
          PROCEDURE, PRIVATE :: readFormatted => readFormattedT
          GENERIC :: READ(FORMATTED) => readFormatted
        END TYPE
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE readformattedT(dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
          CLASS(t),     INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
          INTEGER,      INTENT(IN)    :: unit
          CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
          INTEGER,      INTENT(IN)    :: v_list(:)
          INTEGER,      INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
          CHARACTER(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg
          READ (unit, *) dtv%i
          dtv%j = dtv%i * 2
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

      PROGRAM p
        USE m
        TYPE(t) :: x
        NAMELIST /nml/ x
        READ (*, nml)
        PRINT *, x%i, x%j
      END PROGRAM

Question 1:
Is the following input valid for the above program?

&nml
 b1%i = 100
/

Question 2:
If the input is valid, what is the output of the program, when using
this input?


ANSWER:

1. No, this input is not valid for the given program.  The name of a
component of a structure should not appear in namelist input if that
structure would be processed by a user-defined derived-type I/O
procedure.  Edits are supplied to correct this oversight.

2. N/A


EDITS:

TBD.
