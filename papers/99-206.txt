A. Introduction

Unresolved issue 150 (284:3-7) concerns a constraint on NAME=
bind-spec. The constraint is as follows:

Constraint:     A NAME= bind-spec shall not be specified in the
function-stmt or subroutine-stmt of an abstract interface body
(12.3.2.1) or an interface body for a dummy procedure.

B. Discussion:

The constraint seems to be in contradiction with the approved syntax
on name mangling in paper J3/98-239. This paper mentions the
following:

"More than one BINDNAME= specifier may appear in a BIND <prefix-spec>
for a subprogram, but not an interface body or the BIND attribute for
a variable."

and

"The value of the NAME= specifier on an interface body or
variable must correspond to some C function or variable, respectively,
with the same name."

Thus a NAME= bind-spec may appear in the BIND <prefix-spec> for a
function-stmt or subroutine-stmt of an abstract interface body
(12.3.2.1) or an interface body for a dummy procedure.

In practice, the approved syntax allows a user to write an interface
body for a procedure written in C, so that he can use it in Fortran,
also when the name of the C procedure is not a valid Fortran name.

The only constraint is on the BINDNAME= specifier. So the constraint
should then be, according to the approved syntax:

Constraint:     A BINDNAME= bind-spec shall not be specified more than
once in the function-stmt or subroutine-stmt of an abstract interface
body (12.3.2.1) or an interface body for a dummy procedure.

C. Edits

Edits refer to J3/99-007R1

1.      [285:14] Change constraint to:

Constraint:     A BINDNAME= bind-spec shall not be specified more than
once in the function-stmt or subroutine-stmt of an abstract interface
body (12.3.2.1) or an interface body for a dummy procedure.

2.      [285:16-20] Delete J3 note 150
