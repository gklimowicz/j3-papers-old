Subject: Issues 42-43 : pre-connected units
Reference: J3/06-007


Issue 43 (page 223)

The intention is not to affect the behaviour on image 1 of preconnected
units and the units INPUT_UNIT, OUTPUT_UNIT, ERROR_UNIT, but to
limit their use on other images to simple output. The main mechanism
for parallel i/o is the direct-access file, connected through an
OPEN statement.

Issue 42 (page 223)

We agree that the present wording is unnecessarily restrictive.

Edit to J3/06-007

[223:1] Replace "input/output statement" with "data transfer statement".
