1.	Administrative business

1.1	Call to Order                                                             Monday June 11, 2018  Dan Nagle 
After the call to order, the session was turned over to WG5 

2	WG5: Opening Business

2.1	Introductory remarks from the WG5 Convenor         Steve Lionel 
The convenor welcomed participants, especially those who were attending WG5 for the 
first time.  He noted that this was his first meeting as WG5 convenor.
2.2	Welcome from the Host                                            Brian Friesen 
Brian welcomed participants on behalf of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
2.3	Local arrangements                                                  Brian Friesen/Damian Rouson 
Brian described local arrangements including action to be taken in the event of an 
earthquake.   Damian described the social arrangements for the week and local 
possibilities for dinner.
2.4	Appointments for this meeting 
The drafting committee would be Reinhold Bader, Daniel Chen, David Muxworthy (chair), 
Dan Nagle and Masayuki Takata.   David would act as secretary and Steve Lionel as 
librarian and as editor of the Disposition of Comments document in response to the DIS 
ballot.
2.5	Adoption of the [N2150] agenda 
The agenda was adopted
3	WG5: Matters arising from the Minutes of the Garching 2017 meeting [N2132] 
There were no items not otherwise on the agenda
4	WG5: Status of Garching 2017 resolutions [N2131] 
No matters were raised
5	WG5 Reports 

5.1	SC22 Matters                                                             Steve Lionel 
The convenor reported that SC22 continued to disallow line numbers in standards 
documents.  An SC22 working party had recommended a more timely procedure to 
distribute corrections and updates to existing standards via a JTC1 website. 
 
There was some concern about a possible delay in the provision of the Summary of 
Voting in the SC22 DIS ballot, but in fact the document (SC22N5273) appeared on the 
SC22 website on the first morning of the meeting and was copied for convenience to 
paper 18-168.
5.2	National Activity Reports 
Canada:  The quarterly SCC meeting was held in March with representatives of other 
programming language working groups such as C, C++, COBOL and ADA.  The Fortran 
2018 DIS was approved. 
Germany:  Reinhold Bader is a member of DIN NA 043-01-22 AA "programming 
languages" subcommittee and participated in the yearly meeting, held in Berlin on 
November 27, 2017. He gave a talk about the state of Fortran standardization. Nine of          
the 17 registered members were present at the meeting. 
Japan:  The chair of ITSCJ/SC22/Fortran WG has been changed from Minoru          
Tanaka (Fujitsu) to Hidetoshi Iwashita (Fujitsu).   Translation of F2008 had been 
abandoned and that of F2018 would officially start, at the earliest, in April 2019.          
Preparation for the 2019 Tokyo meeting was in progress, and the preliminary local 
arrangements (N2151) would soon be available. 
UK: The BSI Fortran panel had 19 members, including observers, having gained four 
new members and lost three during the year. The UK voted "approval with comments" on 
the Fortran 2015/2018 second CD and DIS.  The UK voted in favour of Steve Lionel as 
WG5 convenor. 
USA: The US had collected comments and requirements for future developments from 
around the world.  It was considering criteria for the next revision, again open to world-
wide contributions.  Steve Lionel had taken over as WG5 convenor and established new 
WG5 (and PL22.3) websites.
5.3	Report from Primary Development Body (INCITS/PL22.3 Chair) 
PL22.3 was charged with developing the draft standard and had done so.
5.4	Reports from other Development Bodies (Editors/Heads) 
there were no contributing development bodies at present.
5.5	Liaison Reports 
Liaison reports are captured in the PL22.3 section below.

  MPI Forum is meeting THIS WEEK - June 11-14
https://www.mpi-forum.org/meetings/2018/06/agenda
The tickets concerning persistent collective operations are up for a formal vote. Looks like this is 
going to make it this time.  There is some progress on MPI Sessions. Sessions is a very large topic 
– they are making slow progress on different pieces for now.  There is some talk about reviving 
ULFM by splitting it some manner. 
Also note that gfortran intends to use OpenCoarrays as soon as MPI agrees on fault tolerance

OpenMP Liaison report (if any)                                                                                         B. Long
 The OpenMP committee will release a comment draft for the OpenMP 5.0 specification (TR7) in 
early July, which will cover all the new features that will be in the final specification. They have 
been working on voting in final features and fixes to the specification in the last three months, 
in preparation of that draft. Final OpenMP 5.0 release is scheduled for November this year.

Here is a list of the major new features since the last draft release:
- What was called the "concurrent" construct in TR6 has been renamed to the "loop" construct. 
It works similar to "acc loop independent" in OpenACC. It may be used in place of a distribute, 
worksharing-loop, or simd construct, and allows an implementation more flexibility in 
parallelization since it implies that the iterations of the loop are independent. Related to this, an 
order(concurrent) clause was added to distribute, worksharing-loop, and simd constructs to give 
more flexibility to the implementation on parallelization of the associated loops.
- Improved lambda support when executing code on a target device.
- Allow some flavors of non-rectangular loops to be parallelized.
- A scan directive was added to support inclusive/exclusive scan (prefix sum) computations in a 
parallelizable loop.
- A modifier was added to the reduction clause to define task reductions.
- Support "reverse offload" from a target device back to the host (e.g. to do I/O or other things 
that a target device may not support).
- Permit the teams construct to be used outside of a target construct, on the host.
- API routines for defining task dependence objects.
- To allow external asynchronous activities to interact with OpenMP synchronization primitives, 
a clause was added to allow an OpenMP task to stay live (in a "detached" state) beyond the 
completion of its structured block. The clause accepts a pointer to an omp_event_t object, and 
an API routine was added to satisfy that event, permitting the task to complete (and any 
OpenMP synchronization constructs waiting on the task's completion).
- Context-based selection of function variants or directive variants. A directive was added for 
declaring function variants for functions called in an OpenMP program. The compiler may 
replace the call to a function with a call to its variant if it appears in a specified enclosing 
context. A meta-directive was added for specifying different directive variants that may be 
selected from according to the enclosing context. Context may be defined according to the 
enclosing OpenMP constructs, traits for the current device, or other implementation-specific 
traits.
- Non-contiguous array sections may now appear in a target update directive (e.g. update an 
array with a non-unit stride that resides in a target device). The array section syntax for C/C++ 
was updated to support a triplet notation.
- The base pointer used in an array section may now be shaped with a new "pointer shaping" 
syntax.
- New memory allocator traits were added for pinned memory and for specifying fallback 
behavior in case an allocation cannot be satisfied.
- Derived type variables with allocable components can now appear in a map clause. Deep-copy 
semantic is implied.
UPC/PGAS Liaison report (if any)
B. Friesen/D. 
Rouson
Nothing new to add.

OpenACC Liaison report (if any)            
G. Klimowicz
 Information about OpenACC, including the current standard document, 
training materials, and upcoming events can be found at 
http://www.openacc.org/. 
 
The current OpenACC 2.6 standard includes support for manual deep copy of 
data structures to target processors. Discussions have begun on "true" deep 
copy, which allows data movement policies to be defined within the data types 
themselves, and referenced when needed in the accelerated code. Users can 
specify which parts of larger data structures are to be copied to targets. There 
is a technical report https://www.openacc.org/sites/default/files/inline-
files/TR-16-1.pdf that describes the "true" deep copy requirements, beginning 
in Section 3. 
  There are over 110 applications in production or development using 
OpenACC, including:    
     - Gaussian 16 
     - ANSYS Fluent 
     - VASP 
     - MPAS-A 
     - COSMO 
     - GAMERA for GPU 
     - Quantum Espresso 
 
There are several "hackathons" coming up, where researchers bring their 
codes to work alongside with OpenACC experts to accelerate their 
applications. Event dates are posted at https://www.openacc.org/events. 
     - September 10-14 NCSA 
     - September 17-21 Brookhaven 
     - October 1-5 CSCS 
     - October 22-26 OLCF
Flang OpenSource report:  Gary Klimowicz
The goal is to build an LLVM-based Fortran compiler.  Last years’ compiler is 
working on three target architectures.  Embarking on a rewrite of the frontend 
to be consistent with LLVM.  The parser is complete, working on semantics, 
and it will be Open-Sourced.
IFIP/WG2.5 Liaison report               Van Snyder
No change in any of the WG2.5 projects.
WG9 (Ada)                                           Van Snyder
Ada has published a corrigendum.  It has a list of fiftyish things to consider for 
next meeting.  ISO is considering a way for committees to publish corrigenda 
on their websites.

5.6 Closing membership report                L. Menard
         13 member organizations, 12 represented here. 
         Total Membership at end of Meeting 216     : 13
5.7 Comments from members
The editor noted that we passed 66 papers with edits for the standard, and has requested that other 
members doublecheck that we hit them all.
An enthusiastic thank you to the hosts for the use of the facility, and for providing snacks and lunch. 
PL22.3	/m216 adjourned at 9:45, and the meeting returned to WG5.
 
7.	WG5: Decide whether the comments from the DIS ballot require construction of a separate 
FDIS, or whether the FDIS step can be skipped.

There having been over 80 comments on the DIS, many of them generating multiple edits to the 
document, it was clear that an FDIS would be needed.  The Project Editor was to incorporate the 
amendments made at the meeting and to make the draft FDIS available to WG5 members.  It was 
anticipated that this would be done by July 7.  In particular a subgroup consisting of Steve Lionel, Bill 
Long, Dan Nagle and John Reid was delegated to check the document for correctness.  Other members 
were welcome to contribute.

8. WG5: Consider the Fortran defect report
Agenda item 8 was not pursued at this meeting

9.  WG5 Business and Strategic Plans
9.1 Goals for 2018-2021
A draft Strategic Plan (N2154) was approved.  Members were asked to comment on a draft Business 
Plan and Convener's Report for 2017-2018 which would be labelled N2156.

10.  Start planning for the further revision of the Fortran standard
It was noted that most input to the survey on future development of the standard had come from the 
USA and other countries were encouraged to make contributions.

There followed a series of straw votes on topics highlighted in N2147. 
Unless otherwise marked, all straw vote results are of the form:  For – Against – No Opinion
- whether generics should be considered
  straw vote: 14 - 4 – 3  
- whether exceptions should be considered
  straw vote: 7 - 5 - 9

The following items from N2147 had been left undecided in the review in 18-156.
- += and *= syntax
  straw vote: 3 - 11 - 5
- constructors for derived types
  straw vote: 1 - 8 - 12
- allow a specification section in some constructs without block/endblock
  straw vote: 4 - 8 - 7
- allow arrays in allocatables with coarray components
  straw vote: 8 - 5 - 7
 
11.	Future WG5 Meetings
    11.1 Future meetings

    Makki Takata, host for the 2019 meeting, asked for an indication of the size of hotel rooms that 
members might prefer.  A straw vote went: spacious (and more expensive) 5 - smaller 8 - either 3.

    Bill Long offered a meeting in Minneapolis, supported by Cray, and described facilities.  Van Snyder 
offered a meeting in Pasadena and also described local facilities.  A straw vote went:
    Minneapolis 11 - Pasadena 2 - either 6.  The Minneapolis invitation was accepted.

    Nathan Sircombe offered a meeting in Manchester, UK, in 2021, supported by Arm.  He gave a short 
presentation on Arm, local facilities, and the city of Manchester.  The invitation was accepted.

12. Adoption of Resolutions [N2152]
There was some discussion and minor editing of the draft proposed by the Drafting Committee.  After 
editing, resolutions B1 to B3 and B9 to B11 were approved by unanimous acclaim and resolutions B4 to 
B8 were approved by unanimous consent
