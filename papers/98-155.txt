1.  Suppose a sequential formatted file is positioned within
    a record as a result of a nonadvancing READ.

    1.1.  If the next operation performed on the file is a WRITE,
          can the current record be terminated at its current
          position before the next record is written?  Section
          9.2.1.3.2 appears to preclude the record from being
          terminated, but at least one Fortran 90 implementation
          does the record in such an instance.

    1.2.  If next operation is a nonadvancing WRITE and the number
          of characters written does not extend to the end of the
          current record, are the remaining characters at the end
          of the record preserved?


2.  Suppose a partial record has been written as a result of a
    nonadvancing WRITE.  If the file is closed, or a BACKSPACE,
    ENDFILE, or REWIND statement is performed on the file, must
    the partial record be terminated?


3.  When a repeat count is used in list-directed input, must
    all the variables into which the repeated value is read
    have the same type?  I see no reason in the standard to
    assume that restriction, but at least one Fortran 90
    implementation assumes it.


4.  Consider the example

    CHARACTER*80 STRING
    COMPLEX Z

    READ (*, *) Z, STRING

    Suppose the input consists of

    2*(1.0, 0.0)

    After the READ, should Z contain (1.0,0.0) and should
    STRING contain '(1.0,'?

5.  When a file is positioned within a record at the start of
    sequential formatted I/O, where is the left tab limit
    (see Section 10.6.1.1)?  Is it at the start of the
    record or at the point where the file was positioned at
    the start of execution of the statement?
