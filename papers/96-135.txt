++ Thanks Craig, and Mike, for this info.  The current Fortran binding to
POSIX 
++ is a Fortran 77 binding.  That also makes it a Fortran 90 binding, even 
though 
++ it does not make use of some of the "nice" Fortran 90 features that a 
"full" 
++ binding to Fortran 90 would employ.  WG5 curently has a Fortran 90 binding 
to 
++ POSIX as a Fortran 2000 requirement (presumably the "90" would change to at 
++ least "95" and perhaps "2000").  If that requirement is reaffirmed (and 
++ "firmed") at the WG5 meeting in July, then it would make sense to let the 
++ current binding drop; otherwise it makes sense to keep it.

I disagree.  Considering the amount of time that it is likely to take to get
a new binding developed and approved, I would recommend retaining the current
standard until that occurs.  Perhaps it could be retained as an "archived"
standard, e.g. no changes, but still defined.  The drop date is 1997.  The
existence of Fortran 2000 is likely to be at the earliest 2000.  Keeping the
current standard for an additional 5 year term would mean it would drop in
2002, just in time for the new standard to be out.  And since the current
standard specifically references binding to Fortran 77, having both in
existence for a year overlap is no problem because they would be binding to
essentially different languages.

In other words, even if you plan to have a POSIX binding in Fortran 2000,
I think the existing standard needs to be retained for at least one more
five year period.

++ I'll make sure that WG5 has this information, and understands these 
options, 
++ at its July meeting.  Thanks again for the info.  (And good to hear from 
you 
++ again, Mike, after so long.)

I recommend two separate actions.

1) A coordination letter from X3J3 to the IEEE POSIX steering committee
   requesting that IEEE renew the standard for a further 5 years.

2) A coordination letter frow WG5 (is that the languages number?) to WG15
   as an ANSI position to renew the ANSI standard for a further 5 years.

I believe that if X3J3 requests it in this manner it will be a pro forma
approval, especially if the letter mentions that X3J3 plans a Fortran 90
replacement and is only requesting retention of the F77-based standard until
X3J3 can complete the F90 replacement, which is proposed for F-2000.

If it is clear that the Fortran community is asking for it, and yet they make
clear their schedule for replacing it, I see no problems arising.

and

  IEEE Standard for Information Technology--
  POSIX FORTRAN 77 Language Interfaces--
  Part 1: Binding for System Application Program Interface (API)
ISBN 1-55937-230-3

I do not know the ANSI number, but was informed that it was approved
as an ANSI standard.  The IEEE office may have that information.

It never went forward to ISO since it references FORTRAN 77 which is
now only an ANSI archived standard and does not exist in the ISO arena.
There was some talk at one time of registering it for a "fast-track"
ballot as an ISO Technical Report, Type 3, but do not believe that
ever happened.

----from Michael Hanna, 26 Jun 1996:

Jerry,

Lowell Johnson of the POSIX IEEE committee just left me voice mail
about the sunset date of the POSIX binding to Fortran.  I called him
back and left voice mail that I had alerted you to this issue and that
X3J3 was interested in retaining the existing binding while X3J3 
continues to work on a replacement in the syntax of Fortran 90/2000.
I gave him your e-mail address and phone number for further follow up.

His phone is: (612)635-7305 at Unisys
the last e-mail address I have for him is:
   3lgj@rsvl.unisys.com

     To: Shane McCarron
   From: Andrew Tait
     Cc: Jerry Wagener (Chairman X3J3), Miles Ellis (Convenor WG5)
Subject: Open Systems Standards

I have just finished browsing through the "Open Systems Standards" guide
recently published by Uniforum and of which you are the author. I would
like to comment on the information about Fortran contained in this guide.

ISO/IEC 1539:1980 has not been the international Fortran standard for
several years. It was replaced by ISO/IEC 1539:1991,  "Information
technology - Programming languages - Fortran" which  defines the language
known as Fortran 90. This standard will soon  be updated to Fortran 95.
Furthermore, X3 has recently initiated  a letter ballot of its members to
withdraw ANSI X3.9 - 1978  Programming Language FORTRAN (known as FORTRAN
77). This ballot  closes on 96/08/06. If FORTRAN 77 is withdrawn Fortran
90 will be  the only US Fortran standard. At the time IEEE Std 1003.9-1992
was being developed the committees working on the definition of Fortran 90
(i.e. X3J3 and WG5 - I participated in both) questioned the wisdom of
binding to an obsolescent standard. Since FORTRAN  77 may soon be history
one can only question the value of a  binding to a defunct standard. Work
on a replacement for IEEE Std  1003.9-1992 based on Fortran 90 was started
but, to my knowledge,  there has been no activity on it for several years.

Since Fortran 90 compilers are now widely available, adhering to  IEEE Std
1003.9-1992 may not be a good idea as it probably limits  the effective
use of the advanced features of Fortran 90.
