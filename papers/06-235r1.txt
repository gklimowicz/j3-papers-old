Subject: Issues 1-2 : program and images
Reference: J3/06-007


Issue 1 (page 17)

It is expected that one executable is created from a program and that
this executable is replicated and executed asynchronously. There is
just one program, but it is executed multiple times. When we said
'Normal termination of execution of the program occurs on all images
if ...', this was a short-hand for 'Normal termination of execution of
all the replicated executables occurs'.

In earlier standards there was only one image, so oversubscribing
the word "program" to also be the executable was harmless.  That
is no longer true.

Since execution is of images, the subclause on images needs to be the
first thing in 2.3 Execution concepts, not the last. Note that it was
ahead of 2.3 in 06-174r3.

We have concluded that execution of an <end-program-stmt> should
result in termination of execution of all the images.  See 06-236 for
additional discussion. The edit at [15:7] below reflects this change.

Issue 2 (page 18)

We have come to the conclusion that it is a mistake to make units
shared, see issue 39. This leaves only file systems that may be
shared.

[14:4+]  Add new text, relocate 2 Notes and copy text from [18:4-6]:

2.3.0a Images

An executable instance of a Fortran program is an <<image>>.
Execution of a program consists of the asynchronous execution of a
fixed number (which may be one) of its images.  Each image has its own
execution state, floating point status (14.6), and set of data objects
and procedure pointers.  Whether a file is available to any image or
only to a specific image is processor dependent.  Each image is
identified by an <<image index>>, which is an integer value in the
range one to the number of images.
