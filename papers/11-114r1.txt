DISCUSSION

Requirement 8(c) in N1820 says that the lower bounds for an
assumed-shape dummy (or an assumed-rank dummy that is not allocatable
or pointer) are assumed to be zero, as opposed to the default of 1
in Fortran. 

However, this is inconsistent with the way the lower bound is treated 
for other sorts of arrays. A C descriptor describes a Fortran object 
(see the text in 5.1).  And the text at [10:16] says that the lower 
bound should be provided. No edits are needed, but a note will be 
helpful. 

EDITS to N1838:

[10:19+] Add 

NOTE 5.4 
A Fortran procedure with an assumed-shape dummy argument takes no 
account of the lower bounds of the corresponding actual argument. 
C code that is calling such a procedure therefore does not need to 
provide values for the lower-bound members of the elements of the dim 
member of the C descriptor for the assumed-shape array. However, 
Fortran code does provide these data in a C descriptor for an 
assumed-size dummy array and they may be accessed in C code that is 
called.
