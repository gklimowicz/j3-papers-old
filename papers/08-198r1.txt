Subject: Specify only once when specification expressions are evaluated

1.  Introduction

The discussion of when specification expressions that specify bounds,
cobounds, or length parameters are evaluated is spread over three
subclauses.  It would be better to put it in one place.

Instead of tackling cobounds in 5.3.6.3p3, the relationship between
specification expressions and length parameters of automatic objects in
5.2.2p2, and the relationship between bounds and specification expressions
in 5.3.8.2p2, it would be better to do it once and for all in 7.1.11.

2.  Edits

Editor: Delete [86:5.2.2p2].

Editor: Delete [90-91:5.3.6.3p3].

Editor: Delete [92:5.3.8.2p2].

Editor: Insert a new paragraph after [149:7.1.11p9]:

"A specification expression within the specification part of a subprogram
is evaluated as specified in 2.4.5.  A specification expression within the
specification part of a block construct is evaluated as specified in
8.1.4.  The value of a specification expression, and hence of a bound,
cobound or length parameter defined by the value of the expression, is not
changed by execution of executable constructs within the subprogram or
BLOCK construct."
