-----------

Different amounts of data may be needed in the team values of a team
and the amount will certainly depend on the team size. It is likely
that implementations will hold the data in an allocatable component
or its equivalent. This means that if the team variable is a coarray,
assignment to a remote image is not available. Assignment from a
remote image is not useful because the value must be used on the
image on which it was created. We therefore propose to disallow
coarrays of type TEAM_TYPE.

This is a technical change from TS 18508.

Edits to 17-007r2:
------------------

[xx] In Introduction, in the last bullet section of paragraph 2:
"Changes to features previously described by ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015",
at the end of the section, add a sentence:

"A variable of type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is not permitted to be a coarray."


[101:25] In 8.5.6 CODIMENSION attribute, 8.5.6.1 General, para 1, at
the end of C823, add
"or of type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV".
