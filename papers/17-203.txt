Subject: Coarrays that cannot have cosubscripts
Date: 2017 September 27

Discussion:
-----------

If a coarray is of a derived type, a subobject that is formed by
taking a component is also a coarray but it cannot have cosubscripts.
For example, given the declarations
   Type t
      Real r
   End Type
   Type(t) x[10,*]
x%r is a coarray that cannot have cosubscripts. However, it may be
passed as an actual argument to a procedure where the corresponding
dummy argument is a named coarray that can have cosubscripts.

The intrinsic functions COSHAPE (COARRAY [, KIND]),
IMAGE_INDEX (COARRAY,...), LCOBOUND(COARRAY), UCOBOUND(COARRAY), and
THIS_IMAGE(COARRAY,...) are all defined in terms of the possible
cosubscript values that COARRAY may have. They were not intended to be
called for a coarray that cannot have cosubscripts. Edits are provided
to disallow this.
