At M167, this idea got a Hate .. Love score of 4 - 2 - 5 - 1.
However, we think it's worth pursuing for the potential performance
benefits.

Title: New Intents

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: J3/04-135

Basic Functionality: 
-------------------

Add a new intent for dummy arguments:

INTENT(SCRATCH) specifies that the dummy argument is undefined on
entry and return. The argument may be used for scratch work space
only.  Compilers may be able to optimize this argument aggressively.


Rationale:  
----------

Many older Fortran programs have dummy arguments which are used for
scratch work space only.  Any use of existing argument intents gives
wrong information to the compiler.  Also, in the process of converting
scratch work arrays in common blocks to allocatable dummy arguments,
there is no proper intent for 'scratch' variables.  An optimizing
compiler could scalarize a dummy argument array known to be scratch.
Also, final values of the dummy argument do not need to be stored.


Estimated Impact: 
----------------- 

The impact was rated as 5 on the John Reid scale at 167.  Lowered to 4
at meeting 171.

Detailed Specification: 
-----------------------

A new INTENT(SCRATCH) attribute is proposed.

The actual argument associated with a dummy argument with the
INTENT(SCRATCH) attribute shall be definable.  The dummy argument is
undefined upon entry to the procedure and becomes undefined upon
exit from the procedure.
