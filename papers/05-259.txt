            posted with the meeting #172 papers

    Some procedural issues:
     - We do not scribe discussions because it gets too messy.  J3
       decided not to require scribes and to leave the decision on
       an as needed basis.
     - We will experiment with not printing papers at this meeting.
       Papers will be on the local network hub and on memory stick.
       Papers approved each day will be moved to the J3 server each
       night.

1.1.4 INCITS/OMC report (if any) - D. Nagle

    We are alive and well.  Dan will attend the CT22 meeting

    look at C#, CLI, and Design by Contract.

    Dan reports that the joint WG5/J3 meeting #175 in Fairfax, VA
    in Feb-2006 is progressing well.

1.1.5 ISO/WG5 report - V. Snyder, IR

    Van gave the J3 report to INCITS last month:  there are problems
    with Microsoft Word formats and html.  The ISO editors are
    "unhelpful".

1.1.6 J11 Liaison report (if any) - C. Rasmussen

    There are discussions about extensions to varargs

1.1.7 H2 Liaison report (if any) - D. Nagle
