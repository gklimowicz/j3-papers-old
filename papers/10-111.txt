Subject: Comment GB-11: Correct Note on SYNC IMAGES (8.5.4)
Date: 2010 February 01
References: WG5/N1802, WG5/N1803, J3/09-007r3

DISCUSSION

The first paragraph of Note 8.37 in subclause 8.5.4 is incorrect.
SYNC IMAGES(*) does not have the same effect as SYNC ALL in the presence
of some SYNC IMAGES(int-expr) statements.


EDITS

[190:15+] In 8.5.4 "SYNC IMAGES statement", replace the first sentence
of NOTE 8.37 by the paragraph:

    "In a program that uses SYNC ALL as its only synchronization
    mechanism, every SYNC ALL statement could be replaced by a
    SYNC IMAGES (*) statement, but SYNC ALL might give better
    performance."

and move the second sentence to the start of the second paragraph.
