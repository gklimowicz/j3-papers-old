1. Introduction

This document describes editorial corrections that should be applied to the
next revision of the standard.


2. Edits to 10-007r1

[73:12,17] "<interface-name>" should be hyperlinked to the syntax term,
           twice.
[74:8,26] "<interface-name>" should be hyperlinked to the syntax term,
          twice.


3. Edits for subclause 13.6, ALTERNATIVE 1.

In 13.6p2,
[324:2] "C1220"->"C1235".
{Wrong constraint.}
[324:2] Before "or as",
        Insert "as an initial target in a procedure declaration statement
                (12.4.3.6, C1220),".
{Missing description, constraint previously misidentified.}
[324:2-3] After "or"
          replace "as the interface ... statement"
          with "to specify an interface".
{Text omits mention of deferred type-bound procedure declaration.}

In 13.6 after p2, turn the inline table into a proper table "13.2 Specific
intrinsic functions", and change all references throughout the document to
refer to it by its new table name/number.


4. Edits for subclause 13.6, ALTERNATIVE 2.

Split the table into two separate tables:
  "13.2 Specific intrinsic functions"
  "13.3 Restricted-use specific intrinsic functions"

[324:1] Replace "Note ... bullet (*) is"
        With "The functions listed in Table 13.3 are".
In 13.6p2,
[324:2] "C1220"->"C1235".
{Wrong constraint.}
[324:2] Before "or as",
        Insert "as an initial target in a procedure declaration statement
                (12.4.3.6, C1220),".
{Missing description, constraint previously misidentified.}
[324:2-3] After "or"
          replace "as the interface ... statement"
          with "to specify an interface".
{Text omits mention of deferred type-bound procedure declaration.}

Throughout the document, change
  "specific intrinsic procedure listed in 13.6 and not marked with a bullet
   (*)"
to
  "specific intrinsic procedure listed in Table 13.2".
