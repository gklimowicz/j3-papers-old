Subject: C10 - UTI 45, 46, 47 : bits input with I format
Date:    17-aug-2006

---------------------

Unresolved Technical Issues 45, 46, and 47 (page 266) object to the
current text regarding the use of I format for a list item of type
bits.  In particular, the meaning of I format should not depend on the
type of the list item, and that there are cases where the current
description does not lead to a meaningful result.

Reply:

When the I edit descriptor applied only to list items of integer type
it was natural that the interpretation of the descriptor would not
depend on the type of the list item.  If we are to allow the I edit
descriptor to be used with a list item of type bits, it is natural
that the interpretation should depend on the list item type. This is
not a new concept. The G edit descriptor, which can be used with more
than one list item type, has a description that depends on the list
item type.

The problems with the current wording related to undefined behavior in
certain cases can be resolved by wording the description of I format
input for a bits list item along the lines of the G edit
descriptor.

[265:34-35] Replace the whole sentence with:

If the input list item is of type bits, the integer value specified by the
input field is converted to type bits according to the model in 13.3.
