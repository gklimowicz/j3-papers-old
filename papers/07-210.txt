Subject: UTI 113 (p21): Is a co-array section a co-array?
Date: 2007 May 01
References: J3/07-007r1


Discussion

The sentence in the first paragraph of 2.4.6, "An element or section
of an array co-array is not a co-array.", was added for clarification
and not as a change. Previously, there was a gap here, corresponding
to the sentence in the first paragraph of 2.4.5, "An array section is
a subset of the elements of an array and is itself an array."

This is the terminology that we have always had in the description of
co-arrays. We could have changed this last year when we changed the
meaning of 'co-array' to refer to an object on one image rather than
the set of objects on all the images, but we did not. The main reason
is that not all sections of a co-array are sufficiently regular to be
associated as an actual argument with a co-array dummy argument, see
the definition of 'co-array compatible' in 12.5.2.9 [317:8].

We agree, however, that it would be better to define as co-arrays
those subobjects that can correspond to a co-array dummy argument. The
main advantage is that is does way with the term 'co-array
compatible'.

We believe that item (4) in 7.2.1.2 [159:10-11] is correct.

We agree that an edit is needed in 8.5.1. Similar edits are needed in
6.3.1 and 6.3.3.1.
