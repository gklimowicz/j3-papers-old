Subject: "Innermost" is an incorrect term
Date: 2009 May 6
References: 09-007r1

1.  Discussion

7.2.2.4p2 [09-007r1:161:33-35], 12.5.2.9p1 [09-007r1:300:2-5] and
16.5.5p3 [09-007r1:456:3-7] use the term "innermost" to refer to the
most recently invoked and still currently executing instance (except
16.5.5 doesn't bother to say "currently executing").  "Innermost" is a
static term that should only be used to refer to lexical nesting. 
"currently executing" is a meaningless term that shouldn't be used."

2.  Edits
[11:7-8 1.3.70]---------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "a" by "an internal procedure, or a dummy procedure or". 
Replace "7.2.2.4" by "12.6.2.4.

[161:33-35 7.2.2.4p2]---------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace 7.2.2.4p2 by "When a procedure pointer becomes
associated with a target, its host instance is the host instance of the
target (12.5.2.9, 12.6.2.4)."

[300:2-5 12.5.2.9p1]----------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace 12.5.2.9p1 by "When the actual argument is a procedure
the host instance of the dummy argument is the host instance of the
actual argument (7.2.2.4, 12.6.2.4)."

[311:12-14 12.6.2.4p1]--------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete the second sentence of 12.6.2.4p1 because it repeats
2.3.5p2.

[311:17-23 12.6.2.4p4]--------------------------------------------------
Editor: Move the first sentence of 12.6.2.4p4 to the end of what's left
of 12.6.2.4p1.  Delete the rest of 12.6.2.4p4

[311:24 12.6.2.4p5]-----------------------------------------------------
Editor: Move 12.6.2.4p5 to the end of what's left of 12.6.2.4p1.

[311:24+ 12.6.2.4p5+]---------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert a new paragraph.

"The caller of an instance of a procedure is the instance of the
\obs{statement function,} main program\obs{,} or subprogram that invoked
it.  The call sequence of an instance of a procedure is its caller,
followed by the call sequence of its caller.  The call sequence of the
main program is empty.  The host instance of an instance of an internal
procedure \obs{or statement function} is the first element of the call
sequence that is an instance of the host of the internal subprogram
\obs{or statement function}.  The host instance of a module procedure is
the module in which it is defined.  The host instance of a submodule
procedure is the submodule in which it is defined.  The main program or
an external subprogram has no host instance."

[448:2 16.5.1.4p1]------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the first line "An internal ... body, or" and "a" on the
second line by the following:

"An instance of an internal subprogram, module subprogram, or submodule
subprogram has access to its host instance (12.6.2.4) by host
association.  A module procedure interface body or".

[456:3-7 16.5.5p3]------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the paragraph:

"For host association the associating entity is the entity in the
contained scoping unit.  When a procedure is invoked the pre-existing
entity that participates in the association is the one from its host
instance (12.6.2.4).  Otherwise the pre-existing entity that
participates in the association is the entity in the containing scoping
unit.
