Subject: Documenting Compiler Versions
Reference:  Repository J3-033, 05-123R2

This is a revised version of item J3-033.  It documents both the compiler
version and the command line that invoked the compiler.  A function notation
is used to allow different results for different routines which were separately
compiled.

Specification and implied syntax:

Add two new intrinsic character functions to the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module.

GET_COMPILER_VERSION()
Returns a processor dependent result that describes the compiler name, version,
or related information.

GET_COMPILER_COMMAND_LINE()
Returns a processor dependent representation of  the command line that invoked
this compilation.  The result may include additional information, such as default
options or options specified by environment variables.

Both are scalar default character functions. The length and result values are
processor dependent.  They have no arguments. Both may be used in initialization
expressions.  Add a note urging compiler vendors to embed the strings in the .o
file so they can be found later on with other tools.  The functions would
normally return different results for separately compiled routines.

Examples:

    Character(len=72)            ::  CCL = GET_COMPILER_COMMAND_LINE()
    Character(len=*), parameter  ::  CCV = GET_COMPILER_VERSION()

    Print *, GET_COMPILER_VERSION()
    Print *, GET_COMPILER_COMMAND_LINE()
