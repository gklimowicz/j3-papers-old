Subject: Layout of CFI_setpointer specification
Date: 2017 September 25

Discussion:
-----------

In subclause 18.5.5 the specifications for the CFI_* functions follow
a pattern of parts in the order

1 Synopsis.
2 Formal Parameters.
3 Description.
4 Result Value.
5 Example.

with some of the parts omitted if not needed.

In 18.5.5.9 the specification for CFI_setpointer has the order of the
Result Value and Description parts reversed from the normal pattern.
The Result Value should be moved to be after the Description.


Edit to N2137:
--------------

[507:1] In 18.5.5.9 The CFI_setpointer function, p3, move the
one-line paragraph that reads

 " Result Value. The result is an error indicator. "

to [507:10+] so it follows the current paragraph 4 "Description...".
