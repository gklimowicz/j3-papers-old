Subject: UTI 50: co-indexed actual arguments
References: J3/07-007

Discussion

In a subsection on ordinary dummy variables, [315:2-3] states: 

"If the actual argument is a co-indexed object with an allocatable ultimate 
component, the dummy  argument shall have the INTENT(IN) or the VALUE
attribute."

UTI 50 (page 315) says: "Note that this does not match the edit in 06-319r3,
but I believe it correctly reflects the technical discussion therein." 

We agree.
