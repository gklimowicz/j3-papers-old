QUESTION:

The first example in C.6.2 has the statement

  OPEN(UNIT=10, STATUS="SCRATCH", PAD="YES")

to change the padding for a unit that is currently open.
The 6th paragraph of 9.3.4 discusses the use of an OPEN
statement where "the file to be connected to the unit is
the same as the file to which the unit is connected".
It says "If the STATUS= specifier is included in such
an OPEN statement, it shall be specified with a value
of OLD."  Note this wording was introduced in f90
interp 186, which discusses it.

The above-cited OPEN statement from C.6.2 appears to
violate this requirement.  Is the example in error?

ANSWER:

Yes, this is an error in the example.

EDITS:

[322:38] "SCRATCH" -> "OLD"
