Subject: EXTERNAL specifier on IMPLICT NONE
Date: 2017 June 07

Discussion:
-----------
In 8.7 IMPLICIT statement, C893 says "If IMPLICIT NONE with an
implicit-none-spec of EXTERNAL appears within a scoping unit, the name
of an external or dummy procedure in that scoping unit or in a
contained subprogram or BLOCK construct shall be explicitly declared
to have the EXTERNAL attribute."

This does not quite work. Consider the program

! An external subprogram (not internal or module):
   RECURSIVE SUBROUTINE sub()
     IMPLICIT NONE(EXTERNAL)
   ENTRY esub()
     ...
   END SUBROUTINE

The above subprogram defines two external procedures, SUB and ESUB.
So, within the subprogram, SUB and ESUB are the names of external
procedures. However, SUB and ESUB do NOT have the EXTERNAL attribute
within the subprogram, and the user is forbidden to give them the
EXTERNAL attribute (C840). So SUB and ESUB violate C893, because each
one is "the name of an external or dummy procedure in that scoping
unit" and cannot "be explicitly declared to have the EXTERNAL
attribute".

An edit is supplied to correct this.

Edit to 17-007r1:
------------------

[120:26] In 8.7 IMPLICIT statement, C893, after "construct shall" add
"have an explicit interface or".
