Availability:    25 single rooms with kitchenette

Meeting Room: The meeting rooms are located in the Mesa Lab of the
              National Center for Atmospheric Research and
              are reserved for July 18-22, 2016, 0830 - 1730.

Changing Currency: A low-cost currency exchange service may be found
     at https://www.weswap.com/en/  If you wish to use this service
     you must enroll at the web site well in advance; you will get
     a debit card.  You deposit money in your home currency at least
     a week before departure.  Your debit card has a balance
     in the designated local currency converted from your home currency
     for a 1% conversion fee.

     The cafeteria at Mesa Lab does not accept credit cards.
     There is an ATM in Mesa Lab by the entrance to the cafeteria.

Transportation: The recommended airport is Denver International Airport,
     airport code DEN.  Information concerning ground transportation
     can be obtained from the internet at the following URLs:

     http://www.flydenver.com
     http://greenrideboulder.com
     http://www.millenniumhotels.com/usa/millenniumboulder
     http://www.rtd-denver.com/index.shtml

     Information concerning airlines serving DEN may be found here:
     http://www.flydenver.com/flights

Between Airport and Hotel:  I recommend using Green Ride shuttle
     service from the airport to Boulder.  The cost is $49 each
     way (plus tip).  The ride will take about an hour and will
     take you to the hotel.  You will need your flight information
     to book (to know if your flight is late).  For more information
     see http://greenrideboulder.com

     There are other shuttle services at DEN.

     Major rent-a-car firms operate at DEN.

     A taxi from DEN to Boulder is possible but will cost
     about $120-$140 each way on the meter (plus tip).
     (When going to Boulder from DEN, some taxi drivers will negotiate
     a fixed, agreed-in-advance off-meter fare.  Speak
     with the individual driver before leaving DEN to learn more.)

     The RTD bus AB runs directly (with a few stops) between DEN
     and Boulder, but it will leave you at Boulder Transit Center
     rather than at your hotel.  You could take a cab from Boulder
     Transit Center to the hotel (5-10 minutes).  You could walk, but
     may not wish to walk, especially with luggage.  AB runs once an hour
     in each direction.  AB costs $10.5 each way.  Bus drivers
     do not make change, so have a ticket or correct change when boarding.
     The RTD web site http://www.rtd-denver.com/index.shtml
     has more information.

     Note that many transportation services at DEN cease operations
     daily after 2300 or so, so very late arrivals require more planning.
