Reference: J3/06-007r1


Discussion of issue 33 (page 195)

There are cases of STOP and END PROGRAM statements not covered by the
current text in Note 8.29.

Edits to J3/06-007r1

[194:7+6] Following the first sentence of Note 8.29, add a new
sentence: "If the <stop-code> is of type character or does not appear,
or if an END PROGRAM statement is executed, it is recommended that the
value zero be supplied as the process exit status, if the operating
system supports that concept."
