This is mostly typos and similar, perhaps this paper can be passed
directly to the Editor.

Edits:

[99:23] 5.5.9 EXTERNAL attribute, p1,
        small font "or block data subprogram"
{block data is obsolescent}

[100:8-9] 5.5.10 INTENT attribute, C547, replace entire constraint
          "An entity ... LOCK_TYPE ... of this type." with
  "An entity with the INTENT (OUT) attribute shall not be of, or have a
   subcomponent of, type EVENT_TYPE (ref) or LOCK_TYPE (13.9.2.17) from
   the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."
ALTERNATIVE:
  "An entity with the INTENT (OUT) attribute shall not be of type
   EVENT_TYPE (ref) or LOCK_TYPE (13.9.2.17) from the intrinsic module
   ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  An entity with the INTENT (OUT) attribute shall not
   have a subcomponent of type EVENT_TYPE or LOCK_TYPE from the intrinsic
   module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."

[104:10] Move to [104:9+].
{i.e. before the intervening note.}

{an example for implicit none external ?}

[114:1-] after Note 5.39, insert Note 5.39+
"In the following example,

  SUBROUTINE EXAMPLE (X, Y)
    IMPLICIT NONE (EXTERNAL)
    REAL, EXTERNAL :: G
    REAL :: X, Y

     X = F(Y)      ! Invalid: F lacks the EXTERNAL attribute.

     Y = G(X)      ! Valid: G has the EXTERNAL attribute.

  END SUBROUTINE

 the referenced function F needs to have the EXTERNAL
 attribute (\ref{D5:EXTERNAL attribute})."

Rejected edits:

[92:17] "space" is used elsewhere, and it's meaning is clear.

[95:35-36] vs. [95:42] ?  On examination, there is no problem.

[98:31+] Already adequately covered by [98:29-30] and UBOUND itself.

[99:1] Yes, R524 is right.

[104:11-] "end up at" is correct (we are following a chain of pointers
          to the end) but "encounter" is misleading (we are only talking
          about the end, not the middle).

[105:36-37] what is "If an identifier is accessed from another
module and also declared locally, it has the default accessibility
of a local identifier."
{what is this trying to say?}
ANSWER: Exactly what it says.
Q. If it is accessed via use, how did I declare it locally?
ANSWER:  For example, to have the ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE attribute, or
         put it in a NAMELIST.  In these cases the identifier will have the
         local accessibility, and not any default accessibility specified
         for entities from its originating module.
