Discussion:

UTI 153 (page 100) raises questions about [100:6-8]. The intent is
that if an object (coarray or not) is associated (use, host, argument,
pointer) with a coarray then either both have the VOLATILE attribute
or neither does. The text in 11.2.2 and 16.5.1.4 needs to be modified
to say this. Once this is done, the text of the first two sentences of
para. 2 of 5.3.19 is redundant and is best deleted since the text in
11.2.2 and 16.5.1.4 is clearer. Also, the first sentence is faulty
since an object is not "in different scoping units"; we say that it is
associated with an object in another scoping unit.

Edits are supplied to do all this.

As far as I can see, the content of the first sentence of NOTE 5.25
is not stated in normative text. I have taken the opportunity to do
this.

Edits to 09-007:

[100:6-8]. In 5.3.19 VOLATILE attribute, delete the first two sentences
of para 2.

[275:4-6]. In 11.2.2 The USE statement and use association, para 2,
change the middle sentence to
"The accessed entities have the attributes specified in the module,
except that a local entity may have a different accessibility attribute,
a local entity may have the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute even if the
associated module entity does not, and a local non-coarray entity may
have the VOLATILE attribute even if the associated module entity does
not."

[299:10-] In 12.5.2.4 Ordinary dummy variables, before C1238 add
"C1237a A dummmy argument that corresponds to a coarray actual argument
shall have the VOLATILE attribute if and only if the actual argument has
the VOLATILE attribute."

[452:5-7]. In 16.5.1.4 Host association, para. 1, change the third
sentence
"The accessed entities are identified by the same identifier and have
the same attributes as in the host, except that an accessed entity may
have the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute even if the host entity does not and a
non-coarray accessed entity may have the VOLATILE attribute even if the
host entity does not."

[455:1] In 16.5.2.1 General, para 1, add, as new third sentence
"If, by means not specified by the program, the target is referenced,
defined, or becomes undefined, the pointer shall have the VOLATILE
attribute."
