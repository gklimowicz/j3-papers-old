From: /DATA                                                       00-225
Subject: Thursday Report                                     Meeting 153

00-171r2 was passed without Item 6.  The following is our replacement:
Constraint: If the <target> is an <expr> returning a procedure pointer
            or a <procedure-name>, the <pointer-object> shall be a
            procedure pointer.


00-176r1 to be moved with the following amendments:
-New edit at [44:26-27]: Replace "procedure name" with
 "<procedure-name>" and "binding name" with "<binding-name>".
-Strike edit for [44:46].
-Strike "specified by ... specified procedure," from edit for [49:30+].


00-184r1 to be moved with the following edits:
-In edit at [236:16-18], replace colon (":") with period (".") at end of
 first paragraph.
-Move the three bulleted paragraphs in edit at [236:16-18] to be
 replacement text for deletions at [236:20-21], [236:25-26], and
 [236:31-32] respectively (with bullets removed).
-In edit at [236:16-18], change final paragraph to read "There shall be
 not main program arguments other than those described in the following
 sections."


00-192r2 (distributed only to subgroup) contains a great many potential
unresolved issues to be inserted into the document.  In deference to the
editor's tight schedule for producing the next revision, we will sit on
this list until the next meeting.  However, in 00-222 we promised one
to Erik Kruyt, so here it is:
[240:19+]
Unresolved issue ###
00-191 points out that the meaning of the word "identifier" in the
following paragraphs is far from clear to the uninitiated.  Clarify this
without invalidating the unrelated uses of "identifier" in other sections
of the document.
