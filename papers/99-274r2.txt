Issue 87:  [84: 18-27]
Issue 88:  [88: 16-25]

This paper discusses issues related to argument passing between
Fortran and C.

1. Issue 87

Issue 87 mentions that part of the description of the VALUE attribute
might be better put in the form of a constraint, since it is
compile-time checkable. The constraint is added to the section on the
VALUE statement and to the general section on the type declaration
statement.

Edits:

[84:15-16] Delete first sentence of paragraph.

[88:13+] Add:

Constraint: The VALUE attribute shall be specified only for a scalar
dummy argument of a subprogram or interface body that has a
<language-binding-spec>.

[71:19+] Add:

Constraint: The VALUE attribute shall be specified only for a scalar
dummy argument of a subprogram or interface body that has a
<language-binding-spec>.

[84:18-27] Delete J3 note

2. Issue 88

Editor proposes to delete constraints, which are already covered by a
syntax-rule. This implies that syntax rules are diagnosed by the
processor.

3. Misc.

Section 16.2.6 has missed one requirement on interoperation between
Fortran procedures and C functions, viz. that dummy arguments are not
allowed to have the OPTIONAL attribute. The list item needs also to be
converted to explicit constraints.

Edits:

[85:7+]

Constraint: The <dummy-arg-name> shall not be a dummy argument of a
subprogram or interface body that has a <language-binding-spec>.

[86:45+]

Constraint: The <object-name> shall not be a dummy argument of a
subprogram or interface body that has a <language-binding-spec>.

[87:11+]

Constraint: The <object-name> shall not be a dummy argument of a
subprogram or interface body that has a <language-binding-spec>.
