1. Introduction

ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2016, 24.3:
"Within a given clause or subclause, notes shall be
numbered sequentially. The numbering restarts at
each new subdivision. A single note in a
subdivision need not be numbered."

Please remove the numbers in the Notes

(I believe they mean the clause numbers, not the entire numbering.)


2. Response

Accepted.  The notes will be numbered as specified by the Directives.


3. Edits to N2146

Revise the "note" environment to alter the number display to conform
to the Directives.

Check all references to Notes and revise to use ISO/IEC note ref format,
viz "subclause-number, Note number".
