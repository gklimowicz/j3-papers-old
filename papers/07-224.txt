Discussion:

The current words allow an associate selector to be a co-indexed
object and a co-array, but do not specify whether the associate name
remains a co-array and whether it is a co-indexed object. We believe
that the associate name should have the same co-rank as the associate
selector. We should forbid co-indexed objects as the selector since
this effectively hides the fact that the variable is on another image.

Edits:
-----------

[178:20+] Add a new constraint:
"C801a (R804) A <selector> shall not be a co-indexed object."

[179:2] Change "same rank" to "same rank and co-rank"

[179:5] Before the sentence beginning with "The associating entity
has", add a new sentence:

"The associating entity is a co-array if and only if the associated
selector is a co-array. If the associating entity is a co-array it has
the same co-bounds as the associated selector."
