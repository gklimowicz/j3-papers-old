Subject: Proposals for Fortran 201x Suggested at Meeting 200

Proposal 1
Allow optional dummy arguments of a procedure to be actual
arguments to specification functions referenced in restricted
expressions, providing the corresponding dummy argument of the
specification function is optional.  Allow specification functions
to have procedure dummy arguments, provided the corresponding
actual arguments are not internal.  See 13-208r1 for more.

Proposal 2
Allow concatenation of characters of different kinds,
provided the set of characters of the kind with the smaller set
is a subset of the set of characters of the kind with the larger set.
See 13-210 for more.

Proposal 3
Allow a dummy argument with the VALUE attribute to
have the VOLATILE attribute.  See 13-211r1 for more.

Proposal 4
Allow SIZE= with advancing input.
See 13-218r1 for more.

Proposal 5
(1) Conditional expressions: based on one or more conditions, a
    sub-expression is selected for evaluation and the other
    sub-expressions are not evaluated.  This encompasses
    the functionality of "conditional
    and" and "conditional not" operations.

(2) Conditional arguments: using similar syntax, selecting an actual
    argument from two or more data objects.  This should allow for an
    object not to be selected in the case of passing to an optional
    dummy argument.

The expression form should be nestable.
See 13-234 for more.

Proposal 6
We have been thinking about how to respond to IEEE 754 (2008).
We should respond with an update in f1x to make it compatible
with the 2008 revision, or clearly understand why we are not
doing so.  See 13-227 for more.

Proposal 7
Add intrinsic functions to test for equality and
inequality of bit strings.   See 13-230r1 for more.

Proposal 8
Move the following intrinsics from part 2 to part 1:

(a) the GET functionality should be added as an intrinsic
    (perhaps with a slightly different name).

(b) the SPLIT functionality should be added as an intrinsic.

See 13-205r2 for more.

Proposal 9
For arrays with more than a few dimensions, it is tedious to
specify their bounds in specification expressions individually
using existing array intrinsics (for example, size or ubound).
Allowing use of an array to specify declared bounds would allow
such specification and more.  Provide syntax to allow use of an array
to specify the bounds of an new array.  See 13-216, 13-224, and
13-240 for more.
