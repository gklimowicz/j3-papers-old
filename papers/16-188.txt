1. Introduction
===============

Case(ii) of IEEE_NEXT_AFTER says "the result has the value of the next
representable number of X in the direction of Y."

The "direction of Y" could either be interpreted to mean "in the
direction from X to Y" or "in the direction of the sign of Y."

The definition of NEAREST ( X, S ) is that it is the nearest
machine-representable number distinct from X in the direction of the
infinity with the same sign as S.  This is different from
IEEE_NEXT_AFTER.

To remove the possibility of this confusion, state it as "in the
direction from X to Y".

2. Edits
========

[455:14 14.11.21p6(ii)] Replace "direction of Y" with "direction from X
to Y".
