Subject: State that RECURSIVE has no semantics
Date: 2019-March-24

Reference: 18-007r1, 14-179r2

Introduction
------------

Fortran 2018 made procedures recursive by default, rendering the RECURSIVE
prefix a no-op. The change (originated in paper 14-179r2) was to replace
12.6.2.1p3:

"The RECURSIVE prefix-spec shall appear if any procedure defined by the
subprogram directly or indirectly invokes itself or any other procedure
defined by the subprogram."

with (now 15.6.2.1p3):

"The NON_RECURSIVE prefix-spec shall not appear if any procedure defined by
the subprogram directly or indirectly invokes itself or any other procedure
defined by the subprogram."

However, this removed any mention in the normative text of what the
RECURSIVE prefix meant if it was present. The introduction was amended to
say that RECURSIVE was "advisory only", but this is not normative.

In the next revision, normative words should be added to indicate that
the RECURSIVE prefix has no semantics. (C1545 already prohibits RECURSIVE 
and NON_RECURSIVE from appearing together.)

Edit to 18-007r1
----------------

Append to the end of 15.6.2.1p3:

"The RECURSIVE prefix-spec is advisory only."
