Subject: Polymorphic arguments to intrinsic procedures

NUMBER: 
TITLE: Polymorphic arguments to intrinsic procedures
KEYWORDS: polymorphism, intrinsic procedures
DEFECT TYPE: 
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The descriptions of the intrinsic procedures often use the term "type"
without qualification.  It is unclear whether they mean "declared
type" or "dynamic type".  If they mean "dynamic type", then this would
appear to allow unlimited polymorphic arguments to intrinsic
procedures like ABS and SIN.  Resolution of generic intrinsic
procedures in this case would create an undue (and likely unintended)
burden on the processor, and the declared type of the result of such a
function call would be unclear as well.

Question 1:
Are the arguments of the intrinsic functions ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED,
LBOUND, SHAPE, SIZE, and UBOUND permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 2:
(a) Is the ARRAY argument of the intrinsic function CSHIFT permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 3:
(a) Are the ARRAY and BOUNDARY arguments of the intrinsic function
    EOSHIFT permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, then must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic? What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 4:
(a) Are the A and MOLD arguments of the intrinsic function
    EXTENDS_TYPE_OF permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 5:
(a) Are the TSOURCE and FSOURCE arguments of the intrinsic function
    MERGE permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 6:
Are the FROM and TO arguments of the intrinsic function MOVE_ALLOC
permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 7:
(a) Are the ARRAY and VECTOR arguments of the intrinsic function PACK
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 8:
(a) Are the SOURCE and PAD arguments of the intrinsic function RESHAPE
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be 
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 9:
(a) Are the A and B arguments of the intrinsic function SAME_TYPE_AS
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 10: 
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function SPREAD permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What 
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 11:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER 
    permitted to be polymorphic?
(b) Is the MOLD argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If the answer to (b) is yes:
(c) If the MOLD argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 12:

    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 14:
Are any of the other arguments of any intrinsic procedure permitted to
be polymorphic?

ANSWER:

Answer 1:
Yes.

Answer 2:
(a) Yes.
(b) In this case, the result is polymorphic.  If the argument is 
    unlimited polymorphic, then the result is unlimited polymorphic
    and its dynamic type is the same as that of the argument.
    Otherwise, the declared and dynamic types of the result are the
    same as those of the argument.

Answer 3:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) The requirements apply to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) In this case, the result is polymorphic.  If the arguments are
    unlimited polymorphic, then the result is unlimited polymorphic
    and its dynamic type is the same as that of the arguments.
    Otherwise, the declared and dynamic types of the result are the
    same as those of the arguments.

Answer 4:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to the dynamic type.

Answer 5:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) In this case, the result is polymorphic.  If the arguments are
    unlimited polymorphic, then the result is unlimited polymorphic
    and its dynamic type is the same as that of the arguments.
    Otherwise, the declared and dynamic types of the result are the
    same as those of the arguments.

Answer 6:
Yes.

Answer 7:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) In this case, the result is polymorphic.  If the arguments are
    unlimited polymorphic, then the result is unlimited polymorphic
    and its dynamic type is the same as that of the arguments.
    Otherwise, the declared and dynamic types of the result are the
    same as those of the arguments.

Answer 8:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) In this case, the result is polymorphic.  If the arguments are
    unlimited polymorphic, then the result is unlimited polymorphic
    and its dynamic type is the same as that of the arguments.
    Otherwise, the declared and dynamic types of the result are the
    same as those of the arguments.

Answer 9:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to the dynamic type.

Answer 10:
(a) Yes.
(b) In this case, the result is polymorphic.  If the argument is
    unlimited polymorphic, then the result is unlimited polymorphic
    and its dynamic type is the same as that of the argument.
    Otherwise, the declared and dynamic types of the result are the
    same as those of the argument.

Answer 11:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) N/A.

Answer 12:
(a) Yes.
(b) In this case, the result is polymorphic.  If the argument is
    unlimited polymorphic, then the result is unlimited polymorphic
    and its dynamic type is the same as that of the argument.
    Otherwise, the declared and dynamic types of the result are the
    same as those of the argument.

Answer 13:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) In this case, the result is polymorphic.  If the arguments are
    unlimited polymorphic, then the result is unlimited polymorphic
    and its dynamic type is the same as that of the arguments.
    Otherwise, the declared and dynamic types of the result are the
    same as those of the arguments.

Answer 14:
No.

  ===============================================================

The intrinsic functions shown in table 13.2 have a polymorphic result if
and only if the specified argument is polymorphic.  Where the result is
specified to have the same type and type parameters as the argument
specified in table 13.2, the result has the same dynamic type as the
specified argument.  If the specified argument is unlimited polymorphic
the result is unlimited polymorphic; otherwise it has the same declared
type as the specified argument.  If another argument is required to have
the same type as the specified argument, it shall be polymorphic if and
only if the specified argument is polymorphic, and have the same dynamic
type as the specified argument.  If the specified argument is unlimited
polymorphic, the other argument shall also be unlimited polymorphic;
otherwise, it shall have the same declared type as the specified
argument.
