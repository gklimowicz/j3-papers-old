      At the end of 178 I took the task of contacting Reinhold Bader
      concerning the technical issues in Paper 06-373 which he
      submitted to meeting 178.  I sent him an explanation of what I
      thought were a couple of misconceptions that had lead him off
      track.  I received a reply that included:

        "So, with apologies for my misunderstanding of TR19767, I
        consider the suggestion 06-373 retired."

    3. Reading assignment for next meeting:
         C - start of draft through chapter 7
         A - chapter 8 through chapter 12

    Of 11 principal members, 8 were present; 1 voting and 3 non-voting
    alternates were present. 1 visitor was present.

    Matthijs van Waveren is in membership jeopardy because of meeting
    attendance.  Stan Whitlock will notify him and Toon Moene {his
    alternate} that at least one of them must attend meeting #179 in
    order to retain membership.

    No one is in membership jeopardy because of letter ballot voting.

    Aleksander Donev (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) may
    become a principal member at the next meeting.  John Wallin
    (George Mason University) should be officially a member at the
    next meeting.

            creep" [Hendrickson] straw votes for guidance:

      SV #1 from 06-360r1:
           1) Add 4 parameter arrays, INT_KIND_VALUES,
              REAL_KIND_VALUES, LOGICAL_KIND_VALUES, and
              CHAR_KIND_VALUES to ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  (But, NOT a
              BIT array.)  The values will be in non-decreasing
              order by storage size.
        or 2) Add 5 new macro functions, one for each of the kinds
              BITS, INTEGER, REAL, LOGICAL, and CHARACTER.  The
              functions would return the next supported kind value,
              or -2 if there were no more kinds supported.
        or 3) undecided

      SV #2 from 06-360r1:  Add two forms of a MACRO assignment
        statement and add a new macro variable type, which is an
        untyped token string.

          MACRO  macro-local-variable = macro-expr
