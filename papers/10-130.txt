Subject: Clarification of Note 9.12 regarding file position
Date: 2010 February 16

Section 9.3.4.4 specifies the file position after data transfer.
It says that the terminal point of the file after output is the
highest-numbered position to which data was transferred.
Note 9.12 at the end of the section [202:24+] states

     Note 9.12
     The highest-numbered position might not be the current one
     if the output involved T or TL edit descriptors (10.8.1.1)
     and the statement is a nonadvancing output statement.

The highest-numbered position in the file might not be the
current file position if the output involved any of the file
positioning edit descriptors.  The effects of the TR and X edit
descriptors are at least as remarkable as the effects of the T
and TL edit descriptors in this regard.  Therefore, the TR and
X edit descriptors should also be mentioned in the note.
