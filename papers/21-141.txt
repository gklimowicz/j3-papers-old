Subject: Nonconforming example in NOTE 3, p77 Default initialization
Date: 2021-May-27
References: 21-007r1 (N2184)

21-007r1 document in NOTE 3, Section 7.5.4.6 Default initialization
for components lists an example of a derived type with a length-type
parameter on page 77 that does not conform with C767 (R737) that
states, "If component-initialization appears, every type parameter
and array bound of the component shall be a colon or constant
expression."

The following edit is proposed.

[77:NOTE 3]
Change
   CHARACTER (LEN = NAME_LEN) :: NAME = ''

to
   CHARACTER (LEN = NAME_LEN) :: NAME
