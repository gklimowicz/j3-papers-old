WG5 has categorized the items in N1512 as follows.


Interop.

Subgroup to consider.




i/o

US 2.9 Replace the constants IOSTAT_END and IOSTAT_EOR by intrinsic

value for the parent component when a type is extended. 03-122, Cohen.
Accept.

US 2.1 and 2.7a Give any object of CLASS(T) a component named T that
represents its TYPE(T) subobject. 02-295r3, 03-110, 03-139, Donev.
Subgroup to consider.

with TYPE rather than CLASS. 03-110, 03-140, Hirchert.
Defer to J3 to take whatever action it considers appropriate.

US 2.15 Allow BOZ constants to have a kind type parameter value. 
03-102, Snyder. Reject.
