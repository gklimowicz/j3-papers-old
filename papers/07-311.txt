Subject:     IEEE_SET_STATUS argument restriction
Date: 2007 October 26


IEEE_SET_STATUS says of its argument "Its value shall have been set
in a previous invocation of IEEE_GET_STATUS".  This is overly
restrictive?  It prevents something like
         Call IEEE_GET_STATUS(xxx)
             yyy = xxx
         ...
        CALL IEEE_SET_STATUS(yyy)

This is a strange way to say the restriction.  See the essentially
similar restriction on POS on 228:26.

Edit, page 449:2-3
Change the last sentence to

"Its value shall be one that was assigned by a previous invocation
of IEEE_GET_STATUS to its STATUS_VALUE argument."
