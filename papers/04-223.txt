Title: Add unary operators, ++, += etc.

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: 

Basic Functionality: Add the C-like operators: ++, +=, *=, etc., so that
one can write:

x(i,j,k,n) += value

instead of x(i,j,k,n) = x(i,j,k,n) + value




Rationale: Gives shorter, clearer code
Less error-prone
Standard in many other languages

Estimated Impact:   Should be easy to implement?
  Only affects current line, so no negative impacts on code logic
  

Detailed Specification:
