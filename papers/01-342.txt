Subject:	Apply answer to Interp F95/000005 to IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND

Interpretation 000005 to Fortran 95, which was passed by WG5 and is
in Corrigendum 1 (paper N1421) introduces a new possible return value
(-4) for the SELECTED_REAL_KIND intrinsic.

This paper gives the edit to incorporate the corresponding change
to the intrinsic module procedure IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND.

The interp concerns itself with the possibility that both the requested
precision and range can be supported, but not the requested combination.
In that case, SELECTED_REAL_KIND should return -4.

The following edit effects the corresponding change to IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND.

[345:31] Replace

"and -3 if neither is available"

with

"-3 if neither is available, and -4 if both precision and range are
 available, but not together"
