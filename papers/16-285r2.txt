1. Introduction
===============

Interp F08/0013 introduced text that is in 7.5.6.3p1 "When finalization
occurs": "If the variable is an allocated allocatable variable that
would be deallocated by intrinsic assignment, the finalization occurs
before the deallocation."

This overlooked allocated allocatable ultimate components.

Finalization of an allocatable subobject during intrinsic assignment
needs to be clarified.

2. Edits to 16-007r2
====================

[xviii Introduction, under "Data usage and computation"] insert an item
    "Finalization of an allocatable subobject during intrinsic assignment
     has been clarified."

[84:29 7.5.6.3p1 "When finalization occurs"]
  After "allocated allocatable variable"
  insert ", or has an allocated allocatable subobject,",
  making the whole paragraph read:
    "When an intrinsic assignment statement is executed (10.2.1.3), if the
     variable is not an unallocated allocatable variable, it is finalized
     after evaluation of expr and before the definition of the variable.
     If the variable is an allocated allocatable variable, or has an
     allocated allocatable subobject, that would be deallocated by
     intrinsic assignment, the finalization occurs before the
     deallocation."

[84:32 7.5.6.3p2 "When finalization occurs"]
   Replace "component" with "subobject", making the whole paragraph read:
    "When a pointer is deallocated its target is finalized.  When an
     allocatable entity is deallocated, it is finalized unless it is the
     variable in an intrinsic assignment statement or a subobject thereof.
     If an error condition occurs during deallocation, it is processor
     dependent whether finalization occurs."
