We never get around to saying that <declaration-type-spec> in a
<data-component-def-stmt> specifies the type and type parameters of the
components, the <component-attr-spec-list> specifies the attributes it
names, that a <component-array-spec> specifies the DIMENSION attribute,
or that <coarray-spec> specifies the CODIMENSION attribute, as we do at
[86:5.2.1p2].

[65: 4.5.4.1 C454+] ----------------------------------------------------

Editor: Insert a new paragraph:

"The <declaration-type-spec> in the <component-def-stmt> specifies the
type and type parameters of the components in the <component-decl-list>,
except that the character length parameter may be specified or
overridden for a component by the appearance of * <char-length> in its
<entity-decl>.  The <component-attr-spec-list> in the
<component-def-stmt> specifies the attributes whose keywords appear for
the components in the <component-decl-list>, except that the DIMENSION
attribute may be specified or overridden for a component by the
appearance of <component-array-spec> in its <component-decl>, and the
CODIMENSION attribute may be specified or overridden for a component by
the appearance of <coarray-spec> in its <component-decl>."
