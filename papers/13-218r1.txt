Title: SIZE= for advancing I/O

Submitted by: Van Snyder

Status: For consideration

Basic functionality: Allow SIZE= without ADVANCE=

Rationale: There doesn't appear to be a reason to require ADVANCE= if
SIZE= appears.  This would allow to determine the number of characters
transferred by data edit descriptors, exclusive of padding, even if
advancing input is used.

Estimated impact: Nearly trivial

Markham M6 conformance: Remove simple deficiency and discrepancy.

Detailed specification: Allow SIZE= without ADVANCE=.

Draft edits: To estimate scope of project

Delete "or SIZE=" from C923.

Delete "or SIZE=" from 9.6.2.1p2.

Delete "nonadvancing" from 9.6.2.15p1 and 9.6.2.15p2.
