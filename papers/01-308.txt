STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
JP-4)
  4.4.4 Construction of derived-type values
  Before NOTE 4.34:

  "Where a component in the derived type is a pointer, the
   corresponding constructor expression shall evaluate to an object
   that would be an allowable target for such a pointer in a pointer
   assignment statement (7.5.2)."

  Change `an object' to `a result value'.  A value of an expression
  can not be an object, by definition.

ANSWER:   An edit is required but the proposed edit is not quite correct,
because the expression might yield a null pointer.

EDIT: Replace [45:7-9] by

  "Where a component in the derived type is a pointer,
   the corresponding constructor expression shall be an allowable <target>
for
   such a pointer in a pointer assignment statement (7.5.2)."
