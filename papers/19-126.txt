The accompanying PDF, 19-127.pdf, describes a proposal from 2012
(12-176r1) for subprograms parameterized by integer constants.

12-176r1 was submitted for consideration at meeting 199.  It appears in
the minutes (13-202) only in the list of papers.  It was not assigned to
a subgroup, and was not discussed in plenary.

It was developed after discussion of parameterized modules appeared to
be leading to impasse and rejection.

An early (2004) proposal for parameterized modules allowed parameters to
be types, character constants, numeric constants, ....  After some
discussion, parameters other than integer constants were rejected.  That
discussion and choice resulted in the present proposal allowing
parameters to be only integer constants.  Hopefully, it will be realized
that it is important at least to allow types as parameters, in which
case the present proposal can be used as a starting point.
