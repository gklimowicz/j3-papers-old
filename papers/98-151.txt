Subject:  Interpretation request for NULL as a keyword


NUMBER:
TITLE: Use of NULL() as initialization
KEYWORDS: NULL intrinsic, initialization, default initialization,
          DATA statement
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: Rules R429, R505 and R540 respectively describe the syntax for
default initialization of pointer components, pointer objects in type
declaration statements and pointer objects in DATA statements.  These rules
seem to indicate that NULL is to be considered a keyword in those contexts.
This has the surprising effect that the first example below is a standard
conforming program, while the second is not.  That is, in some contexts,
something that looks very much like a reference to an intrinsic function, is
in fact a keyword followed by parentheses.

Example 1:

      MODULE MOD
        INTRINSIC NULL
      END MODULE MOD

      PROGRAM PROG
        USE MOD, DISASSOCIATE=>NULL
        INTEGER, PARAMETER :: NULL = 17
        INTEGER :: J = NULL

        INTEGER :: I
        INTEGER, POINTER :: P => NULL(), P2
        DATA P2, I/NULL(), NULL/
        TYPE DT
          INTEGER, POINTER :: P => NULL()
        END TYPE DT
        TYPE DT2
          INTEGER, POINTER :: I
          INTEGER :: J
        END TYPE DT2
        TYPE(DT2) :: S = DT2(DISSASSOCIATE(), NULL), S2
        DATA S2/DT2(DISSASSOCIATE(), NULL)/
      END PROGRAM PROG

Example 2:

      MODULE MOD
        INTRINSIC NULL
      END MODULE MOD

      PROGRAM PROG
        USE MOD, DISASSOCIATE=>NULL

        INTEGER, POINTER :: P => DISASSOCIATE(), P2
        DATA P2/DISASSOCIATE()/
        TYPE DT
          INTEGER, POINTER :: P => DISASSOCIATE()
        END TYPE DT
      END PROGRAM PROG

In some places in the scoping unit of PROG example 1, NULL() is used to
specify initialization or default initialization, while in others NULL is
a named constant, and DISSASSOCIATE() must be used to specify initialization.

1) Is example 1 a standard conforming program?

2) Is example 2 a standard conforming program?

3) Was it the intent of the committee that, within the contexts of R429,
R505 and R540, NULL should be treated strictly as a keyword rather than as a
reference to an intrinsic function?
