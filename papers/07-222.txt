Subject: SAVE attribute, modules, main programs
Date: 2007 May 09

1. Introduction

We say in four places
  "SAVE attribute or ... declared in a main program"
et cetera.

This is clumsy, especially now we have to say "or the specification part of
a module or submodule".

We also missed adding the module/submodule case in one place.

We also missed out the "specification part" or "scoping unit" in some
places, making the text incorrect.

This kind of thing is happening because we say that SAVE doesn't do
anything in a main program, module or submodule.

2. Proposal

That we implicitly give the SAVE attribute in those places, and allow
it to be confirmed.  This is the same artifice we use for initialised
variables, so if it works for them it will work for us.

That allows us to simplify the wording in several places.

3. Edits to 07-007r1

[68:4.5.4.5p4+0-1]
  Change
    "has the TARGET attribute, either has the SAVE attribute or is
     declared in the main program,"
  to
    "has both the TARGET and SAVE attributes,"
{This is the place we missed - it is for "initialization target".}

[76:Note 4.52+0-1]
  Delete "or that is declared in the main program, a module, or a
	  submodule".
{Simplification.  Existing wording is broken!}

[88:37] Replace entire constraint with
  "An automatic object shall not have the SAVE attribute."
{Simplification.}

[93:C528]
  Replace entire constraint with
    "A co-array or an object with a co-array ultimate component shall have
     the SAVE attribute unless it is allocatable or a dummy argument."
{Simplification.  Previous wording was arguably broken since it implied
 that mere possession of the SAVE attribute was not enough, it had to have
 the SAVE attribute "specified" for it.}

[102:5.3.15p5+0]
  Replace first sentence "The SAVE attribute has no effect..." by
    "A variable, common block, or procedure pointer declared in the scoping
     unit of a main program, module, or submodule implicitly has the SAVE
     attribute, which may be confirmed by explicit specification."
{Longer but makes wording elsewhere safer and simpler.  Note: previous
 wording broken - did not mention "scoping unit"!}

[484:16.5.2.2.3p1 item (8)(d)]
  Delete item.
{Simplification - no longer needed.}
