Discussion from DIN 1
---------------------

Allowing the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute for assumed-rank entities 
might cause a problem within Fortran in case a future extension is 
considered, which would allow entities to change rank at run time 
("deferred-rank"). In this case, it would be preferable for a
declaration

    REAL, DIMENSION(..), ALLOCATABLE :: X

to denote a deferred-rank entity. Alternatively, a mechanism would be 
required (within Fortran) to disambiguate deferred-rank from
assumed-rank entities during execution of the program.

Therefore it is suggested that, until the Fortran facilities are 
properly defined, the ALLOCATABLE and POINTER attributes be 
prohibited for assumed-rank entities.  

Response from PL22.3
--------------------

The potential future benefit of deferred-rank entities is less than the
current benefit of assumed-rank pointer and allocatable entities.

Therefore PL22.3 chooses not to make the change requested in the first
comment from DIN.

If deferred-rank entities are found to be desirable in the future, a
syntax different from the syntax for assumed-rank entities can be
developed.
