Subject: UTI 129 (p96): note on bounds and co-bounds of a co-array

Discussion

The matter of bounds and co-bounds for dummy arrays is discussed in
12.5.2.8 and the notes there (Notes 12.30 and 12.31) are under
revision (see J3/07-304 and J3/07-305r1). Note 5.8 is misleading and
does not seem to us to be needed here. Let's delete it.

The editor is also criticizing the text in 12.5.2.8 (page 316). In
particular, some of it is already said in 5.3.7.1. Also, he feels that
'the claim of "independence" is somewhat overstated'. We therefore
propose a rewrite of this text here.


Edits to 07-007r3:

[96:21+] In 5.3.7 DIMENSION attribute, delete NOTE 5.8.

[316:24-28] In 12.5.2.8 Co-array arguments, replace the first two
paragraphs by:

"If the dummy argument is a co-array, the corresponding actual
argument shall be a co-array.  If the dummy argument is an allocatable
co-array, the corresponding actual argument shall have the same rank
and co-rank."

[317:2] In paragraph 3 of 12.5.2.8 "Co-array arguments" replace "the
actual argument" with "the corresponding actual argument".
