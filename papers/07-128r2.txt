Discussion

UTI 76 (page 500) proposes to change the text currently at
[499:41-42], which reads

  "(16) When a dummy argument of type bits that is associated with an
  effective argument of a different type becomes defined, the
  effective argument becomes defined."

to (text at the end of the J3 internal note, top of page 500)

  "(16) When a dummy argument of type bits that is associated with an
  effective argument of a different type becomes defined, whether the
  effective argument becomes defined is processor dependent."

Subgroup believes that leaving the text as "becomes defined" doesn't
provide enough information and changing it to "processor dependent"
makes the facility too difficult to use.  An edit is proposed to
explain how the definition happens.


Edit:
At the end of [499:42] insert the phrase
"following the rules of intrinsic assignment for an <expr> of
type bits (7.2.1.3)"
