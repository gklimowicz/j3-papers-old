1. Introduction

At a recent joint J3/WG5 meeting, it was resolved that the name of an
intrinsic module could be the same as the name of a user-defined module in
the same program.  The primary point was that it was undesirable and
unnecessary to prevent the user from having a module with the same name as
that of an intrinsic module used elsewhere in the program, for instance in
a third-party library.

This point and others made during the discussion apply equally forcefully
to the situation of the user having any other global entity (e.g. an
external subroutine), with the same name as the intrinsic module.  Indeed,
although the discussion was focussed on the particular issue of modules, I
do not believe it was the intention that the user ought to be prohibited
from having a program unit, external procedure or common block with the
same name as an intrinsic module.

This paper suggests that this peculiar restriction be fixed.

[407:21] "and a ... name" ->
  "may have the same name as another program unit, common block, or
   external procedure".

[407:24] After "program" insert "that is not an intrinsic module".
