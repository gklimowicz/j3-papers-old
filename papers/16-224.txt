Subject: LOCAL nonpointer polymorphic

1. Introduction

There is no clear prohibition against a LOCAL (or LOCAL_INIT) entity
being a nonpointer polymorphic.  This could happen if the outer entity
were a nonpointer polymorphic dummy argument.  This is doubtless already
invalid by virtue of the standard only allowing polymorphic when the
entity is allocatable, a pointer, or a dummy argument; the LOCAL thingy
is obviously not itself a dummy argument.

It would also seem to be unreasonably expensive to have such things, so
the user should have to write a BLOCK construct with an explicit
declaration statement and the ALLOCATE statements etc. himself
so that he will know how expensive it will be.

However, this should be stated clearly.
