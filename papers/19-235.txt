Subject: Image selectors and established coarrays.
Date: 2019-October-14


1. Introduction

Paper 19-180 contains three purported interpretation requests glommed into
a single paper. This paper discusses the third of them.


2. The alleged problem

From 19-180:
    "Section 9.6, paragraph 3 explains the semantics of image selectors
     that specify TEAM=, TEAM_NUMBER=, or that specify neither.  There are
     several problems with this paragraph.
...
    "Finally, if neither TEAM= nor TEAM_NUMBER= is specified, nothing is
     said as to whether the coarray object has to be established."


3. Response from /INTERP

/INTERP believes there is only a single case where a coarray can be
"not established" in the current team or an ancestor thereof: that is,
when it is an unallocated allocatable.

An unallocated allocatable is not permitted to be referenced or defined.
Using an image selector for a subobject of an allocatable coarray that
is not allocated is thus already not conforming.

Therefore there can be no problem.

/INTERP will entertain assertions to the contrary if such an assertion is
accompanied by otherwise conforming Fortran code demonstrating the asserted
problem.


4. Response from the Editor

The editor agrees that the paragraph in question is large and unwieldy,
and deserves to be more clearly written. In particular, splitting it into
three paragraphs, each of which describes one of the three cases (TEAM=,
TEAM_NUMBER=, and neither) would almost certainly be an improvement.

Adding a sentence to the "neither" case noting that the coarray needs to
be established in the current team or an ancestor thereof, and/or noting
that if the coarray is allocatable it needs to be allocated, would likely
also be an improvement.
