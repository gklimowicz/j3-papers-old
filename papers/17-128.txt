Subject: error stat= are positive not non-zero
Date: 2017 February 10

Reference: 17-007

In 16.6p6 [345:29-30], the value assigned the STAT= variable
when an error occurs is stated to be a nonzero value.

Error conditions for all other STAT= correspond
to a positive value of the STAT= variable.
And indeed this is stated in the next paragraph at [345:35-36].

Edits:

{ In 17-007 at 16.6 Collective subroutines p6 [345:29-30] }

The text now reads:

"If the STAT argument is present in an invocation
of a collective subroutine and an error condition occurs,
it is assigned a nonzero value
and the A argument becomes undefined."

Change "nonzero" to "positive"

The new text reads:

"If the STAT argument is present in an invocation
of a collective subroutine and an error condition occurs,
it is assigned a positive value
and the A argument becomes undefined."

{ make consistent with other STAT= error values }
