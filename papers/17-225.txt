1. Discussion

Line 21 on page 586 (C.10.2 Procedures defined by means other than
Fortran (15.6.3)) includes the phrase "including any restrictions on
the structure for organization of those procedures".  I suspect the
phrase should say "structure or organization", not "structure for
organization".  I have no idea what the phrase "structure for
organization" might mean.  An edit is provided.

2. Edit to 17-007r2

[586:21] C.10.2 Procedures defined by means other than Fortran (15.6.3)
         Replace "structure for organization" with "structure or
organization".
