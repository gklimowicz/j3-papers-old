NUMBER: F03/0075
TITLE: C interop of derived types with array components
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, dummy procedures
DEFECT TYPE: CLARIFICATION/ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following C struct:

typedef struct
{
   float x[5];
} array

interoperable with this Fortran type:

type, bind(c) :: array
   real(c_float) :: x(3)
end type

ANSWER:

The intended answer is no. According to the current words in 15.2.3, the
answer is yes, since only interoperability of the types of the C and
Fortran components is required. This is however an accidental omission
and array components have not been integrated correctly.

EDITS:

Append to the end of C1505 a new sentence:

"If the component is an array, the corresponding C component shall be an
array and the shapes of the two arrays shall be as prescribed in
15.2.5."
