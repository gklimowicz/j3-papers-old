Subject: Issues 42 & 43, teams for preconnected units
Reference: J3/06-007r1, J3/06-258

Discussion of issues 42 and 43 (page 220)

The intention is not to affect the behaviour on image 1 of preconnected
units and the units INPUT_UNIT, OUTPUT_UNIT, ERROR_UNIT, but to
limit their use on other images to simple output. The main mechanism
for parallel i/o is the direct-access file, connected through an
OPEN statement.

We agree that the present wording is overly restrictive, and that the
connect team for INPUT_UNIT should be image 1.

While discussing this paper we realized that the description of the
CLOSE statement did not explain that it causes team synchronization.
This was only explained in the description of SYNC TEAM.

Edits to J3/06-007r1

[220:7-10] Replace the last paragraph of 9.4.5.17 TEAM= specifier:
"Units connected to a preconnected file, other than the unit identified by
the value INPUT_UNIT in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV have a
connect team consisting of all the images. If an image with index greater
than one executes an input/output statement on one of these units, it
shall not be a READ statement. The unit identified by the value INPUT_UNIT
in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is preconnected with a connect
team consisting of image 1 on image 1 and is not preconnected on other
images."

[220:10+] Add a new sentence to the end of Note 9.24:
"File positioning statements are not allowed for preconnected units,
including units preconnected to OUTPUT_UNIT and ERROR_UNIT, since they
have a connect team that has more than one image."

[221:18+] Add a new paragraph
"All images in the connect team of the unit specified in the CLOSE
statement, and no others, shall execute a CLOSE statement for the unit.
There is an implicit team synchronization (8.5.3)."
