Subject: usage error in list

1. Discussion

Item (1) in the list of classes of entities [514:4] (19.3.1 Classes
of local identifiers) contains a usage error some texts call a
"comma splice".  Item (1) begins

      (1)  except for statement or construct entities (19.4), named
           variables, named constants, named procedure pointers, ...

The exclusion "except for statement or construct entities (19.4)"
appears to be part of the following list until the end of the list.
Moving the exclusion from item (1) to the start of the sentence makes
the sentence easier to read and does not change its meaning.

Edits are provided.

[514:3] 19.3.1 Classes of local identifiers, p1
        Replace "entities in the classes" with

         in the classes".

[514:4] 19.3.1 Classes of local identifiers, p1
        Delete "except for statement or construct entities (19.4),".

         construct entities, in the classes

             (1) named variables, named constants, named procedure
                 pointers, ..."
