1.  Introduction
--  ------------

A program should be allowed to include entites defined by
means other than Fortran that are not global entities.

2.  Discussion
--  ----------

The definition of a program given in [15:7-8 1.3.105p1]
states that a program is a "set of Fortran program units
and global entities defined by means other than Fortran".
The requirement that the entities defined by means other
than Fortran be global entities was not present in
Fortran 2003.  It is not a requirement of the text in
[30:23-25 2.2.2p1].
