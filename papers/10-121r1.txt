Technical fix to statement functions
------------------------------------

[312:5-6]---------------------------------------------------------------
"<primaries>" isn't a syntax term, and intrinsic operations aren't
primaries.  As written, "( <expr> )" is a prohibited primary.  The
sentence would read better as singular instead of plural.

Editor: Replace the first sentence "The <primaries>... intrinsic
operations." by

 "Each primary shall be a constant (literal or named), a reference to a
 variable, a reference to a function, or an expression in parentheses. 
 Each operation shall be intrinsic."

Incorrect cross references
--------------------------

[50:4]

[114:34]
Editor: Replace "4.5.2" by "4.5.2.3".

[453:10]

[472:18]
