---------------------

Unresolved Technical Issues 67 and 68 (page 405) raise issues
concerning inconsistencies in the types of the arguments to
MERGE_BITS.  

Reply: Since this is a new function without existing practice issues
to influence a choice, the simplest solution is to disallow integer
arguments.

Edits:
-----

[405:18] Delete " or integer".

[405:20] Replace the description of the MASK argument with "shall have
the same type and type parameters as I."
