Subject:    File positioning statements using units not connected
Reference:  15-226, 16-007

1. Introduction
===============

Many (most?) processors create a file with a processor-dependent name if
a unit that is not connected is referred to by a BACKSPACE, ENDFILE, or
REWIND statement.  This should be explicitly processor dependent.

2. Edits
========

[237:19 9.8.1p1] Append a sentence to the end of the paragraph:
"The effect of referring to a unit that is not connected using a
BACKSPACE, ENDFILE, or REWIND statement is processor dependent."

[510:6+] Insert an item:

" o the effect of referring to a unit that is not connected using a
    BACKSPACE, ENDFILE, or REWIND statement (9.8.1);"
