Subject:    Unhelpful conspiracy between 8.1.3.3 and 16.5.1.6
Reference:  16-007
Date: 2016 January 27

1. Introduction
===============

It is unhelpful that a subclause named "Attributes of associate names"
doesn't discuss three of the important attributes, and that discussion
of two important ones not discussed in that subclause is well hidden
eight clauses distant.

It can't discuss type (and type parameters) if we want to use it both
from the specification of the ASSOCIATE construct and the SELECT TYPE
construct because the type and type parameters are different in those
cases.

What are missing, and there's no obvious way to find or notice their
absence, is whether the associate name has or does not have the
ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute.  This specification is tucked away in
16.5.1.6, for which there is a cross reference but no clue that these
attributes are discussed therein.  It would be more helpful if these
attributes were described in 8.1.3.3 "Attributes of associate names".

2. Edits
========

[173:11 8.1.3.3p2] Before "If the selector..." insert "The associate name
does not have either the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute."

[173:12+ 8.1.3.2p3+] Insert a paragraph:

"The associating has no other attributes."

{This makes it explicit, not implied by omission, that (unlike the case
with host association), the associating entity does not have the INTENT
or OPTIONAL attributes.}

[494:9-10 16.5.1.6p2] Replace "; the associate name ... and does not have
the ALLOCATABLE attribute" with a full stop.

[494:11-12 16.5.1.6p3] Replace "; the associate name ...and does not have
the POINTER attribute" with a full stop, and combine 16.5.1.6p3 with
16.5.1.6p2.

[494:14 16.5.1.6p4] After "selector" insert "if it does not have the
POINTER attribute or with the target of the selector if it has the
POINTER attribute".

[494:17 16.5.1.6p5] After "associate name" insert ", except that if the
associate name is polymorphic it cannot be assigned a value by intrinsic
assignment (7.2.1.2) because it does not have the ALLOCATABLE attribute".

or at [494:18+ 16.5.1.6p5+] insert a NOTE

  "NOTE 16.8a
     A polymorphic associate name cannot be assigned a value by
     intrinsic assignment (7.2.1.2) because it does not have the
     ALLOCATABLE attribute."

or insert this note as NOTE 8.2a at [173:15+ 8.1.3.3p3+]

3. Alternative edits
====================

If we absolutely must hide discussion of these attributes in 16.5.1.6,
at least alert the reader that there are even more attributes discussed
eight clauses distant in 16.5.1.6.

[172:33 8.1.3.2p2] After "8.1.3.3" append "and 16.5.1.6".

[173:12+ 8.1.3.2p3+] Insert a paragraph:

"The associating has no other attributes."

{This makes it explicit, not implied by omission, that (unlike the case
with host association), the associating entity does not have the INTENT
or OPTIONAL attributes.}

[188:40 8.1.9.3p2] After "8.1.3.3" append "and 16.5.1.6".

[191:19 8.1.10.2p8] After "8.1.3.3" append "and 16.5.1.6".

[494:5 16.5.1.6] Append "and attributes of associate names" to the
subclause title.

[494:17 16.5.1.6p5] After "associate name" insert ", except that if the
associate name is polymorphic it cannot be assigned a value by intrinsic
assignment (7.2.1.2) because it does not have the ALLOCATABLE attribute".

or at [494:18+ 16.5.1.6p5+] insert a NOTE

  "NOTE 16.8a
     A polymorphic associate name cannot be assigned a value by
     intrinsic assignment (7.2.1.2) because it does not have the
     ALLOCATABLE attribute."
