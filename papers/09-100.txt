    the history of programming language standardization.  Van Snyder
    offered to pursue the possibility of scanning some of the committee's
    paper records.

    "John Reid had been re-appointed as WG5 Convenor for a further three
    year term."

    to all comments.

5.4 Reports from Other Development Bodies

    - Bill Long: /INTEROP will be worked on the TR at this meeting
    - Malcolm Cohen: 007 has not changed. 018 not yet updated with
      Corrigendum 3.

5.5 Liaison reports:

    J11 (C) : Craig Rasmussen was not present. Dan Nagle reports that C1x
    is attempting to standardize threading as a thin binding to threading
    that can be mapped to Pthreads and other models. They need to rethink
    memory model.  They have a new work item, but no schedule.

    MPI : Craig Rasmussen was not present. Dan Nagle reports that additions
    to the interop TR that are motivated by MPI and that is the example.
    But it can be used with any C library that has buffers.  MPI wants help
    with Fortran interfaces.  See N1755.

    UPC: Dan Nagle attended a UPC workshop at George Washington University.
    There are 3 compilers available: Berkeley, gcc, and others.  They are
    working on a fast track international standard.  The UPC spec has been
    trimmed down to exclude TEAMS and collectives and parallel I/O. The rest
    is the CORE that will be fast tracked.  HP has a product that is
    shipping. Cray has one. IBM UPC compiler will become a commercial
    product over the next year.  The EDG front end supports UPC.  The HP
    rep assured Dan that their infrastructure supports all of both UPC and
    coarrays. They paid Intrepid to put UPC support into GCC mainline. The
    IBM rep stated the infrastructure for X10, UPC, and coarrays is the same.
    They are looking at ways to interoperate between UPC/MPI and
    coarrays/MPI.  The UPC people were happy to see both Dan and Bob
    Numrich at the UPC meeting. The PPW tool from the University of Florida
    could support coarrays as well, but not implemented yet. 

    IEEE: Mike Ingrassia had nothing to report.  754r was published on
    August 29, 2008.

    IFIP/WG2.5: Van Snyder went to the Toronto meeting in August.  High on
    the agenda was interval arithmetic.  They wanted to extend 754, but it
    was too late in the process. IEEE 1788 wil eventually standardize
    interval arithmetic.

    OpenMP: Nothing to report

    OWG/WG23 - Dan attended the Stuttgart meeting last month.  Fortran
    input was acknowledged, but not yet reviewed. Clause 5 is the first
    interesting one.  The main concept: programmers forget about statement
    side effects and end up making mistakes so start with existing coding
    standards.  Clause 6 lists language independent vulnerabilities.
    Clause 7 is for applications vulnerabilities.  There is an annex for
    each specific language.  Fortran will probably be first, then Ada,
    then C, in one year intervals. C++ not participating.

    N1759: "SC22 (Monday) John welcomed Rex Jaeschke (SC22 Chair) who was
    attending the meeting. Rex introduced himself and summarised his role
    as SC22 chair.  He noted that SC22 had now agreed that teleconferencing
    could be used for meetings. He outlined the broad rules under which it
    could operate for subgroups. He stressed that this was not intended as
    a replacement for face-to-face meetings but could be used to carry out
    business where it was deemed appropriate and agreed by the different
    parties."

** /J3 **

    Dan Nagle (J3 chair) welcomed everyone to the meeting, thanked
    the Japanese delegation for hosting the meeting, and started working
    through the J3 Agenda.

    Bill Long will be the acting J3 Secretary for this meeting.

** /WG5 **

6.  Consider the ballot comments on the draft revision (N1723) of 
    Fortran 2003 and decide on any technical changes to be made

6.1 Discussion of UK Comments - N1740

    Comment 1: Extent of the revision.

      N1759:"There was nothing to add to what had been said at the last
      meeting.

      "There was then a discussion on the Parameterised Derived Types
      (PDT) feature which had caused implementers of Fortran 2003 some
      difficulty. One vendor had now implemented them successfully and
      another was close. Four other vendors were not currently
      implementing them. One vendor was concentrating on the object-
      oriented feature.

      "There was some discussion about a possible Corrigendum that might
       remove those parts of PDTs that were giving vendors special
       difficulty. Only complete removal of LEN parameters was suggested.
       There was no consensus and the approach was eventually dropped as
       a way forward."

    Comment 2: MPI interface help.

       Delegated to the HPC subgroup.  Mike Ingrassia offered to take on
       the Liaison for MPI Fortran interface.

    Comment 3: Volatile coarrays N1744, N1745.

      N1759: "The main issue discussed was that of whether VOLATILE
      coarrays should be allowed in the language.

      "There seemed to be general agreement that the functionality enabled
      by having VOLATILE coarrays was needed (e.g. spin-loops) but that
      there may be better/safer ways of providing at least some of the
      functionality. This could be provided by language features and/or
      intrinsic procedures.

      "Following some broad discussion the issue was deferred to subgroup."

    Comment 4: Should coarrays be part of the core standard?

      N1759: "There was some discussion on whether coarrays should be
      included as a separate part of the standard. Most of this discussion
      repeated arguments put forward at the last meeting. Eventually John
      Reid concluded that no real consensus could be reached and that,
      since a majority of countries wanted coarrays in Part 1, this was
      the only way forward."

      US, Canada, Netherlands favor; UK and Japan prefer part 4. Japan
      voted abstain based on the agreement. John will send email to get a
      reading on the German position.

      There was some discussion of N1748 (Memory model for coarrays).

    Comment 5: Wording in the standard needs improving.

      Current papers are on the right track, except volatile.  Delegate
      to HPC.

    Comment 6: Generalized edit for real and complex - N1743.

      Delegate to /JOR

6.2 Discussion of Canada comments

    Comment 1: Coarrays restrictions.  Papers approved by J3 papers.

    Comment 2: Resolution already passed by J3.

    Comment 3: Finalizing coarrays.

      Malcolm Cohen says there are semantics for finalizing coarrays.
      The whole point of finalization is a guarantee of safety and clean
      up.  It just calls the final subroutine: call final_routine (x[3])
      calls this subroutine on the current image.  Only called for
      intent(out), since the coarray has the save attribute.  Send to
      Data subgroup for consideration of 08-199. 

    Comment 4:

      - allocatable coarrays: 08-158 "Allocatable coarrays with intent
        (out)" passed at m184

      - Coarray dummy argument: 08-162r2 "allocatable coarray and
        non-coarray allocatable dummy" passed at m184

    Comment 5: Want locks but not nested locks

      See 08-256r2 -  No objection to accepting this, but need to defer
      to subgroup about issue of inquiring of owner function.

6.3 Discussion of Germany comments:

    Bessel Function comments delegated to /JOR

6.4 Discussion of USA comments:

    In N1741:

      - 08-019r1 contains editorial and technical fixes
      - 08-020r1 contains feature changes
      - 08-180r1 - needs reconsideration - passed to /EDIT
      - 08-199r1, 08-207, and 08-214 are feature changes - wrong box

    See 282 for list of things needing more work: 203r1, 209r4, 216r2,
    228r1, 230r3, 232r2, 233r2, 237r1 - delegated to J3 to deal with
    the details and look at 019r1. 

    Feature request section:

      - Accepted locks already
      - 147r1 VALUE restrictions: IBM objected before in J3. Refer back
        to subgroup (/DATA).  251r3 needs to be resolved with UK comment
        on the same issue.
      - Case for type_is_extensible intrinsic is weak.  Back to /DATA
        subgroup
      - 256r2 to /HPC for review
      - 266r1 to /JOR for review
      - 207 - Finalization paper - back to /DATA
      - 214 - image control in do concurrent - should be considered as a
        feature change. No objections, so that one is approved
      - 143r3 to /DATA
      - 256r2 to /HPC

   Some noted that the syntax for invoking a type-bound procedure which
   is bound to a coarray looked like a remote procedure call.  Others
   noted that the syntax for invocation of a type-bound procedure was
   completely specified in F2003;  F2008 is integrating coarrays into

    T1-T6 were accepted unanimously (individual vote and country votes):

      T1.  Convenorship of WG5
      That WG5 congratulates John Reid on his reappointment as WG5
      convenor until September 2011.

      T2.  Appreciation of Primary Development Body and Project Editor
      That WG5 congratulates the primary development body for its work on
      constructing the Fortran International Standard Committee Draft
      according to the agreed schedule.  Further it particularly
      congratulates the Project Editor, Malcolm Cohen, for the excellent
      quality of his work.

      T3.  Appreciation of SC22 Chairman

      Jaeschke, for attending this meeting and for his contributions to it.

      T4.  SC22/WG23 Programming Language Vulnerabilities
      That WG5 notes the publication of PDTR 24772 on Language
      Vulnerabilities (SC22 document N4420 and also available as document
      N0163 on the WG23 website http://aitc/aitcnet.org/isai/ ) and notes
      that WG23 intends to produce a Fortran-specific annex.  WG5 members
      are encouraged to send comments on the annex to Dan Nagle and/or to
      join WG23.

      T5.  WG5 Document Archive
      That WG5 notes the concern of SC22 for the importance of preserving
      the history of programming language standardization (SC22 resolution
      08-01) and intends to extend its own electronic document archive.

      N4319 and 08-007r2) as modified by the edits specified in WG5-N1760.
      The primary development body is encouraged to make editorial
      corrections and clarifications and to resolve inconsistencies, but
      the technical content should not be changed unless a serious flaw
      is found.

    T8-T10 were accepted unanimously (individual vote and country votes):
