Subject:  Interpretation request on END INTERFACE statement


NUMBER:
TITLE: Restrictions on <generic-spec> on END INTERFACE
KEYWORDS: INTERFACE block, END INTERFACE, generic procedures
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: According to section 12.3.2.1 [194:18-20]

    The <generic-spec> may be included in the <end-interface-stmt>
    only if it was provided in the <interface-stmt> and, if
    included, shall be identical to the <generic-spec> in the
    <interface-stmt>.

It is not clear what the words "shall be identical" were intended to mean.
In particular, were they intended to merely convey the idea that the two
<generic-spec>s shall specify the same entity, even though such an entity
might be represented in more than one way, or were they intended to convey
something more restrictive?  Are either of the following examples standard
conforming programs?

Example 1:

      PROGRAM P
        INTERFACE OPERATOR(.NE.)
          LOGICAL FUNCTION F(I, C)
            INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: I
            CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: C
          END FUNCTION F
        END INTERFACE OPERATOR(/=)
      END PROGRAM P

Example 2:

      MODULE MOD
        INTERFACE GEN
          SUBROUTINE SUB1(I)
            INTEGER :: I
          END SUBROUTINE SUB1
        END INTERFACE
      END MODULE MOD

      PROGRAM P
        USE MOD, G1=>GEN, G2=>GEN
        INTERFACE G1
          SUBROUTINE SUB2(L)
            LOGICAL :: L
          END SUBROUTINE SUB2
        END INTERFACE G2
      END PROGRAM P
