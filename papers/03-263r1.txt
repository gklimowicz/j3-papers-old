Subject: CLASS IS type guard statements and intrinsic types

The response to this paper can be found in paper J3/03-267
==========================================================

When the changes involving select type, intrinsic types, and unlimited
polymorphics were made, I don't believe the following case was ever
considered.

SELECT TYPE(a)
TYPE IS (integer)  ! If "a" is an integer, the following block 
                   ! will be executed.
  ...
CLASS IS (integer)  ! The following block can never be executed.
  ...
END SELECT

It seems weird to me that this should be allowed, since one of the
blocks can't be executed.  I don't think we should allow intrinsic
types in CLASS IS type guard statements.  There is no reason for them
to appear there.


Proposed edits to the Fortran 2003 FCD:
---------------------------------------

[162:22+] Add the following constraint:

C816.5 (R823) The <type-spec> in a CLASS IS <type-guard-stmt> shall
              not specify an intrinsic type.
