To: WG5
From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Editor's Report for N1723 (08-007r2).
Date: 2008 March 11

1. Introduction

This document describes the changes between 08-007r1 and 08-007r2;
these are also known as WG5 documents N1718 and N1723.

Edits are described using the following

  [<page>:<identifier>]
where <identifier> is one of
  <subclause>p<paragraph>
  Rnnnn
  Cnnnn
  Note x.yy
optionally followed by a sub-paragraph grouping identifier such as
  "item (n)" for numbered list item "(n)",
  "WAIT" for the item labelled "WAIT",
optionally followed by +N for a line offset after the first.

2. Technical Changes

[somewhere in c13] Reinstated CO_LBOUND and CO_UBOUND, but with the
                   CO_ARRAY argument name changed to COARRAY.

[319:13.5,table 13.1,IMAGE_INDEX] "CO_ARRAY"->"COARRAY", twice.
{These underscores are really virtual hyphens, so they ought to have been
 removed by 08-125.}

[322:13.5,table 13.1,THIS_IMAGE] "CO_ARRAY"->"COARRAY".
{This underscore is really a virtual hyphen, so it ought to have been
 removed by 08-125.}

[325:13.7.77] "CO_ARRAY"->"COARRAY" throughout this subclause (5 times).
{These underscores are really virtual hyphens, so they ought to have been
 removed by 08-125.}

[344:13.7.55p3,WAIT] "character"->"logical".
{This is a long-standing typo.}

[344:13.7.55p3,EXITSTAT&CMDSTAT] "character"->"integer", twice.
{Two more long-standing typos.}

[390:13.7.162] "CO_ARRAY"->"COARRAY" throughout this subclause (9 times).
{These underscores are really virtual hyphens, so they ought to have been
 removed by 08-125.}

[513:C.10.1p1&p2] "CO_ARRAY"->"COARRAY" 5 times.
{These underscores are really virtual hyphens, so they ought to have been
 removed by 08-125.}

3. Editorial Changes

[throughout] The header and footer width has been made the same as the
             text width.

[65:4.5.4.2p1+1] In the first sentence,
                 Before "DIMENSION clause", "the"->"a".
{Article ought to be indefinite.  This subclause needs rewriting anyway,
 but that is too big a job for a simple editorial fix.}

[78:C491] Delete spurious "inheritance association".
{This was a mistyped indexing/hyperlinking macro ref.}

[171:8.1.3.3p2] Deleted spurious cross-reference for "selector".
{This is defined on the previous page, and used in the immediately
 preceding paragraph on this page without cross-reference.}

[190:8.5.4,note 8.37] Moved note to follow paragraph 2.
{There was certainly no reason for this note to be where it was, and
 ISO recommend that all notes be at the end of a subclause unless there
 is good reason otherwise.}

[194:9.3.1p3+1] "Whethera"->"Whether a".

[217:9.6.4.2p2] Joined this sentence to the previous paragraph.
{08-129r1 did not ask for this sentence to be detached from the paragraph.}

[235:9.10.2.27] "behaviour"->"behavior".
{We mostly spell this the latter way, and should be consistent.}

[292:12.5.2.5p6] After "INTENT(IN)" insert "attribute".
{Missing word.}

[314:13.3.1p1] "behaviour"->"behavior".
{We mostly spell this the latter way, and should be consistent.}

[320:13.5,table 13.1,LOG_GAMMA] Move LOG_GAMMA to follow LOG.
{Was out of order.}

[341:13.7.48p3,SHIFT+1] Remove extraneous long dash between BIT_SIZE & (J).
{Typo: the long dash was produced by a vertical bar, which is next to the
 tilde on my keyboard.  (Tilde is a LaTeX spacing character.)}

[342:13.7.49p3,SHIFT+1] Remove extraneous long dash between BIT_SIZE & (J).
{The same typo as above.}

[397:13.9.2.19] Insert missing comma between references.

[397:13.9.2.19] Delete "or an IOSTAT= specifier (ref),".
{That is no longer possible after the removal of team i/o.}

[404:14.9p2] Unnumbered this paragraph because it is not one.
{Actually, LaTeX still makes it a paragraph, I just turned off paragraph
 numbering!  And tweaked the vertical spacing so it looks less like one.}

[443:16.4p12(last)] Deleted paragraph about macro local variables.
{This paragraph should have been, but was not, under the "macros" test.}

[461:bullets 4,6 and 7 on this page]
  "user-defined derived-type input/output" -> "defined input/output"
  "user-defined derived-type procedure" -> "defined input/output procedure"
  (twice).
{Missed some cases applying 07-308r1 when producing 08-007.}

[463:B.1p2,item(1)+2] Before "has been deleted", ","->"; this".
{Edit to [503:9-10] from 08-105r2 not fully applied.}

[463:B.1p2,item(6)+1] After "In" insert "{\sc Fortran 66},".
{Edit to [503:34] from 08-105r2 not fully applied.}

[509:C.9.6p7] "user-defined derived-type input/output"
              ->"defined input/output".
{Missed a case applying 07-308r1 when producing 08-007.}

[577:Annex D] Deleted stray macro BNF arising from deficiences in the
              indexing program: it picked up nonexistent cross-references
              in clauses 2 and 3.
{The program that generates Annex D does not understand LaTeX conditionals,
 so BNF and constraints need manual deactivation.}

[583:Annex E,1st sentence] Delete "glossary".
{We just have definitions now, not glossary definitions.}
