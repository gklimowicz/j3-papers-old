Subject: F202Y Obsolete default implicit typing
Date: 2023-June-12

Reference: 23-147, 23-154

Default implicit typing has been a significant source of programming
errors over the decades, and is generally considered poor practice.
As there are better methods to provide typing for identifiers, 
default implicit typing should be deemed obsolescent. Processors would
thus required to have the abiity to diagnose the use of implicit
typing, and those learning Fortran would be taught that it is not
a recommended practice.

This proposal does not affect typing specified by an IMPLICIT statement.
Deletion of the feature is not being suggested, as processors will 
continue to support it and deletion would remove the standard's 
description of how it interacts with the rest of the language.
