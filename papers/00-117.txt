Subject:  Procedure Interface Body

1. Introduction

We inconsistently occasionally use "procedure interface body" (5 times) for
"interface body" (39 times).  We've only used the former term in the
definition
of scoping unit and in the recently added BIND specs: everywhere else
(including in the definition of the thing itself) we use just "interface
body".

We should be consistent with our usage to avoid confusion (the interface
body
vs. interface block confusion is bad enough already, but we're stuck with
that one I think - for now anyway).

2. Edits to 00-007
