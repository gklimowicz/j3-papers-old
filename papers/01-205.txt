1. Introduction

The editor complains
  "We now have two different definitions of the bnf term <object-name>."

Well, Fortran 95 has two different definitions of <only-use-name>, so
it must be ok to do this sort of thing, right?

An edit is supplied to make it clear that explicit syntax rules override
assumed syntax rules.  The same edit fixes the same problem with
<abstract-interface-name>.

2. Edits to 01-007r1

[5:35+] After "are assumed" insert "unless otherwise specified".
{ALTERNATIVE INSERTION:
        "except when an explicit rule exists".
 ALTERNATIVE INSERTION 2:
        "unless an explicitly specified syntax rule has the same form"
 ALTERNATIVE INSERTION 3:
        "; an explicit syntax rule for a term overrides an assumed rule"}

[66:13-21] Delete J3 note 320.

[252:20-24] Delete J3 note 330.
