[465:26+] add

"B2.9+ Label DO Statement
The label in the DO statement is redundant
with the construct name.  Further, the label allows
unrestricted branches and, for its main purpose,
(the target of a conditional branch to skip the rest
of the current iteration)
is redundant with the CYCLE statement,
which is clearer."
