Discussion:
-----------

Damian pointed out in email that the example code in C.5.5 Simple
example using event has this line:

TYPE (EVENT_TYPE), ALLOCATABLE :: DONE (:) [*]

which is incorrect syntax for an allocatable coarray declaration.
This was wrong in the TS, but should be fixed here.


Edit to J3/16-007r1:
--------------------

[547:36] In C.5.5 Simple example using event, in the "Outline of code
example", for the declaration of DONE, change "[*]" to "[:]". Making
the statement read

TYPE (EVENT_TYPE), ALLOCATABLE :: DONE (:) [:]
