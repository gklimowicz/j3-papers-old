Edit to 07-007r3:

[317:3-] In 12.5.2.8 Co-array arguments, replace NOTE 12.31 by

    Each invocation of a procedure with a nonallocatable co-array
    dummy argument establishes a dummy co-array for the image with
    its own bounds and co-bounds. During this execution of this
    procedure, this image may use its own bounds and co-bounds to access
    the co-array corresponding to the ultimate argument on any other
    image.  For example, consider

         INTERFACE
            SUBROUTINE SUB(X,N)
               INTEGER :: N
               REAL :: X(N,N)[*]
            END SUBROUTINE SUB(X)
         END INTERFACE
          ...
         REAL :: A(1000)[:]
          ...
         CALL SUB(A,10)

    During execution of this invocation of SUB, the executing image
    has access through the syntax X(1,2)[P] to A(11) on image P.
