QUESTION:

Given
  REAL X
  X = ... some value ...
may
  IF( X+3.0 .EQ. 3.0 )...
be transformed into
  IF( X .EQ. 0.0 )...
by the processor?

References are to J3/04-007.

7.1.8.3 Evaluation of numeric intrinsic operations has a discussion of
"mathematically equivalent", "mathematical value" and "computational
results".

7.1.8.5 Evaluation of relational intrinsic operations has "Two
relational intrinsic operations are relationally equivalent if their
logical values are equal for all possible values of their primaries."

"values" in that context is ambiguous to me.  Is it the infinite set
of mathematical values or is it the finite set of hardware
representable (computational) values?

My brief scan of F2003 finds that "values" without any adjectives
means what the hardware can represent.

Assuming "values" in 7.1.8.5 means what the hardware can represent,
then I conclude that the transformation cannot be done.  However, Note
7.22 shows "I > J" transformed into "J-I < 0"; which is not true for
the finite set of hardware values (due to undefined behavior of
overflow), but is true for the infinite set of mathematical values.

I believe that "possible values" should be changed to either:
  possible mathematical values 
or
  possible computational values
