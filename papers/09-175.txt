1.  Discussion (paraphrased from e-mail from Malcolm)

Subclause 12.8.3p2 [317:9-12] pretends that MVBITS is an ordinary
subroutine with a body that does the things that 13.7.119 [376:1ff]
says it does.  If it were, the first sentence of 12.8.3p2 would
contradict the requirements of 12.5.2.13 [302:4ff], since there is no
exception there for elemental or intrinsic subroutines.  So the first
sentence can (in fact should) be deleted.

There aren't any requirements on actual arguments in 12.5.2.13; it
isn't about actual arguments at all (or about dummy arguments, for
that matter); it's about what a procedure cannot do to actual
arguments.  One might argue that what was meant in 12.8.3p2 was to
restrict what elemental procedures could do to the actual arguments
associated with their dummy arguments, but 12.5.2.13 already specifies
that.  So the second sentence can (in fact should) be deleted.

Now there's nothing left.
