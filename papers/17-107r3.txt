Subject: STAT= wording clarification for ALLOCATE

Discussion
----------

The first sentence of 9.7.4, para 3, begins "If an ALLOCATE or
DEALLOCATE statement with a coarray <allocate-object> is executed when
one or more images of the current team has initiated normal
termination of execution, the <stat-variable> becomes defined..."
This is only the case if a STAT= specifier appears. What happens if
one does not appear is a bit far away in 9.7.3.1p3.  It would be
clearer here to give <stat-variable> context by saying that a STAT=
appears.

The last sentence of the same paragraph begins "In any case...". But
the case of STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is already specified by the second
sentence of the paragraph (the <allocate-object>s are allocated on the
active images of the current team). So this case should be excluded
from the "any case".

--------------


[147:1] In 9.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 3, sentence 1, after "If an
ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement with" add "a STAT= specifier and".

[147:5-6] remove ", each allocate-object is successfully allocated or
deallocated on all active images of the current team and "

[147:9-10] replace "In any case, each allocate-object has a processor-
dependent status:" with a new paragraph "If a failed image is detected
and no other error condition occurs, each allocate-object is successfully
allocated or deallocated on all the active images of the current
team.  If any other error condition occurs:"

{three bullets on lines 11-16 remain here}
