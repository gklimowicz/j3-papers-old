Discussion of Issue 35 (page 200)

A team is identified by a value of type IMAGE_TEAM, not the list of images
provided to FORM_TEAM. This value is returned by a single invocation of
FORM_TEAM. It may hold private data that is specific to the image in
question and to that specific invocation of FORM_TEAM. The private
data may be needed for efficient team work. All the images in the team
should hold the value that was returned in a single call of FORM_TEAM for
the team.

To answer the specific question of the editor, the two SYNC_TEAM
statements are not equivalent - they are referring to different teams
even though the list of images in the two teams is identical.
