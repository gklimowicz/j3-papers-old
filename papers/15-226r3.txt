=============================

[25:10+ 1.6.3p1 "Fortran 2008 compatibility"]
 Insert a new paragraph:
  "Fortran 2008 specifies that the IOSTAT= variable shall be set to
   a processor-dependent negative value if the flush operation is not
   supported for the unit specified.  This part of ISO/IEC 1539 specifies
   that the processor-dependent negative integer value must be different
   from the named constants IOSTAT_EOR or IOSTAT_END in the
   ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.".
 {that's very wordy!}

[201:16 9.3.3.2p2 "Sequential access"]
 Change "When connected for sequential access"
 to     "While connected for sequential access".

[201:29 9.3.3.3p2 "Direct access"]
 Change "When connected for direct access"
 to     "While connected for direct access".

[202:13 9.3.3.4p2 "Stream access"]
 Change "When connected for unformatted stream access"
 to     "Whle connected for unformatted stream access".

[202:22 9.3.3.4p4 "Stream access"]
 Change "When connected for formatted stream access"
 to     "While connected for formatted stream access".

[208:10-11 9.5.6.1p2 "[OPEN statement] General"]
 Delete "and, once connected, a reference to it may appear in any
         program unit of the program".

[208:32 9.5.6.1p8 "[OPEN statement] General"]
 Change "OPEN statement on that file"
 to     "OPEN statement for that file".

[218:13 9.6.2.12p1 "REC= specifier in a data transfer statement"]
 Change "only in an data transfer"
 to     "only in a data transfer".

[229:1 9.6.4.8.3p20 "Defined input/output procedures"]
 Change "When a parent READ"
 to     "While a parent READ".

[229:3 9.6.4.8.3p21 "Defined input/output procedures"]
 Change "When a parent WRITE"
 to     "Whle a parent WRITE".

[229:6 9.6.4.8.3p22 "Defined input/output procedures"]
 Change "When a parent data transfer"
 to     "While a parent data transfer".

[235:13-15 9.9p13 "FLUSH statement"]
 Delete "The IOSTAT= variable shall be set to a processor-dependent
         positive value if an error occurs, to zero if the
         processor-dependent flush operation was successful, or to
         a processor-dependent negative value if the flush operation
         is not supported for the unit specified.".
 {this belongs in 9.11.5}

[235:25-26 9.10.1p1 "Forms of the INQUIRE statement"]
 Change "The INQUIRE statement may be used to inquire about
          properties of a particular named file or of the
          connection to a particular unit."
 to      "The INQUIRE statement may be used to inquire about
          properties of a particular named file, of the
          connection to a particular unit, or the number of
          file storage units required for an output list.".

[235:28 9.10.1p1"Forms of the INQUIRE statement"]
 Change "All specifier value assignments"
 to     "assignments to specifier variables".

[242:11-12 9.10.3p1 "Inquire by output list"]
 Change "when there are"
 to     "and data will be read from or written to the file using".
 Change "the same"
 to     "an".
 After "output list" append "that specifies transfer of a sequence of
 objects having the same types, type parameters, and extents, in the same
 order."

>>> the old text:
      The value shall be suitable as a RECL= specifier in an OPEN
      statement that connects a file for unformatted direct access when
      there are data transfer statements with the same input/output list.
    becomes this text:
      The value shall be suitable as a RECL= specifier in an OPEN
      statement that connects a file for unformatted direct access and data
      will be read from or written to the file using data transfer
      statements with an input/output list that specifies transfer of a
      sequence of objects having the same types, type parameters, and
      extents, in the same order.

[244:13 9.11.5p1 "IOSTAT= specifier"]
 Delete "or".

[244:16 9.11.5p1 "IOSTAT= specifier"]
 Replace the full stop with ", or" and insert a list item:
  "  o a processor-dependent negative integer value different from
       IOSTAT_EOR or IOSTAT_END if the IOSTAT= specifier appears in a
       FLUSH statement and the processor does not support the flush
       operation for the specified unit.".
 {the processor dependency is already listed in A2 [504:5-7}

[245:3 9.12p5 "Restrictions on input/output statements"]
 Change "shall not depend on the values of"
 to     "shall not depend on the value of".

[503:35+ A.2 "Processor Dependencies"]
 Insert a list item:
  "  o The value assigned to the variable in the ID= specifier in an
       asynchronous data transfer statement when execution of the
       statement is successfully completed (9.6.2.9)."

[504:13,14 A.2 "Processor Dependencies"]
 Change "9.11"
 to     "9.11.1"
 twice.
