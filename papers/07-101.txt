QUESTION:

 Is it allowed for a procedure to have both the BIND(C) and
 elemental attributes?

 Constraint C1242 disallows trivial ways of writing an elemental
 BIND(C) procedure. However, the following example achieves the
 effect for sub_c without violating the syntactic constraint.

   elemental subroutine sub(x)
     entry sub_c(x) bind(c)
   end subroutine sub

ANSWER:

 No, it is not allowed. Constraint C1242 was intended to disallow
 the combination of elemental and BIND(C), but it inadvertantly
 failed to cover the case shown in the above example.

EDITS

 Replace C1242 in subclause 12.5.2.1 with
 "C1242 A procedure shall not have both the ELEMENTAL and BIND
  attributes".

  {An alternate edit would be to leave C1242 alone and add a
  constraint on the ENTRY statement. I think this edit is better,
  as it is phrased in terms of semantics instead of syntax. This
  one thus applies to any syntax for doing the same thing.}

  {Also note that the omission of the (R1227) from this edit is
  intentional and important. The revised constraint applies
  generally rather than just to R1227.}
