From: Bill Long
Subject: Editor's report for WG5/N2033  (J3/14-276)
Date: 2014 November 06


Document WG5/N2033 was prepaired by applying edits to WG5/N2027 from
PL22.3 meeting 205 papers as well as additional edits.  All of the
edits applied to WG5/N2027 are summarized below, grouped into three
parts.  The citations refer to [page:line] locations in WG5/N2027
prefixed by the number of the paper (omitting the 14-) containing the
edit, or "Ed" in the case of additional edits.  Corrections and
explanations for additional edits are noted in {Comments} following
the citations.

Document WG5/2033 is the same as J3/14-276.

Part I consists of edits to WG5/N2027 based on the content of these
papers passed at PL22.3 meeting 205: 14-238r2, 14-250r2, 14-253r2,
14-254r1, 14-260, 14-261, 14-265, 14-266r1, 14-267r1, 14-273, and
14-274.  Additional minor edits are intermixed in the list.  The edits
are in page and line number order.

Part II consists of edits to WG5/N2027 for eight issues and
inconsistencies that became apparent after applying the Part I
edits. These changes are editorial repairs that do not make technical
changes.

Part III consists of edits to repair four minor technical defects in
WG5/N2027 as modified by edits from PL22.3 meeting 205 papers.


Part I: Edits to WG5/N2027 from M205 papers:
============================================


Edits for Introduction
----------------------

274:[iv] Introduction paragraph 1, line 2: Delete "a set of".

274:[iv] paragraph 3, line 5: Delete "sets of".


Edits for Clauses 1 and 2
-------------------------

(none)


Edits for Clause 3 - Terms and definitions
------------------------------------------

250r2:[5:3+] Add
"3.0 <<active image>>
An image that has not failed, stalled, or initiated termination."
{Ed: "An" -> "an".}

274:[5:11+] Add
"<3.2a>
<established coarray>
coarray that is accessible within a CHANGE TEAM construct from outside
the construct (5.1)"

250r2:[5:31] Before "has not initiated" insert "is not a stalled image
or".  {Ensure stalled and failed are distinct states.}

Ed:[5:30-32] Change definition of failed image to: "an image for which
references or definitions of a variable on the image fail when that
variable should be accessible; or an image that is not a stalled
image, is not a stopped image, and fails to respond during the
execution of an image control statement or a reference to a collective
subroutine (5.8)" {With the edit in 250r2, the definition has too many
instances of "or" making it hard to parse. Cleaned up version.}


250r2:[5:32+] Add
"3.4a <<stalled image>>
An image that has encountered an <image-selector> that identifies an
image that has failed and has not yet executed an END TEAM statement
that makes it active again (5.9)" {Ed: "An" -> "an".}



Edits for Clause 4 - Compatibility
----------------------------------

(none)


Edits for Clause 5 - Teams of images
------------------------------------

274:[9:4] Replace "have been" with "are".

274:[9:15] Replace "block" with "construct".

274:[10:13] Delete "the" before "type"

267r1:[10:14+] Add following constraint.
"C507a (R503) A <coselector-name> shall be the name of an accessible
              coarray."

274:[10:27] Change
"a coarray that does not appear in a <coarray-association>"
to
"a coarray that is not an associating entity".

274:[10:30] Delete the first "the".

274:[10:40] Delete "the" before "other".

273:[11:6-7] Replace "an ancestor of the current" with "the current or
an ancestor". {Ed: The edit line was adjusted from 6 to 6-7.}

274:[11:Note 5.3, line 1] Insert "image" after "Each".

274:[11:Note 5.3, line 6] Append ", ONLY: TEAM_TYPE".

274:[12:18] Replace "it shall be executed by the same statement" with
"the same statement shall be executed".

250r2:[12:22] Change "failed" to "failed or stalled".

Ed:[12:26] Insert "active" before "images".
{Missed edit to limit actions to active images. An inactive image
cannot execute a FORM TEAM statement.}

274:[13:5] After "image M" add "since execution last began in this
team".

250r2:[13:23] Before "has not initiated" insert "is not a stalled
image or".  {Ensure stalled and failed are distinct states.}

250r2:[13:25] Delete "unless ... paragraph".

250r2:[13:21-24] Move the two sentences "A failed image is one
... program execution." to a separate paragraph following the first
paragraph of 5.8.

Ed:[13:21-24] Change the first sentence describing a failed image to:
"A failed image is one for which references or definitions of a
variable on the image fail when that variable should be accessible; or
an image that is not a stalled image, is not a stopped image, and
fails to respond during the execution of an image control statement or
a reference to a collective subroutine."  {With the edit in 250r2, the
definition has too many instances of "or" making it hard to
parse. Cleaned up version.}


250r2:[13:25-26] After "one nonzero status value" add "other than
STAT_STALLED_IMAGE ".
{Make STAT_STALLED_IMAGE lowest, STAT_FAILED_IMAGE second lowest.}

250r2:[14:1] Change "STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is" to
       "STAT_FAILED_IMAGE and STAT_STALLED_IMAGE are".

250r2:[14:5-7] At line 6, change "is treated as a failed" to "becomes
a stalled". Then move this paragraph to a new section after NOTE 5.9
headed "5.9 STAT_STALLED_IMAGE".

274:[14:4] Replace "are" with "shall be".

266r1:[14:7] After "construct" (moved to the new 5.9 by paper
14-250r2) insert "after execution of all finalizations and
deallocations that would have occurred during the normal completion of
active procedures invoked within the CHANGE TEAM block, without
synchronization of coarray deallocations.

274:[14:Note 5.8, lines 3-4] Replace "may" with "might" because ISO
rules do not allow requirements or permissions in nonnormative text.
{Ed: two instances changed.}

250r2:[14:NOTE 5.8] Delete the last sentence of Note 5.8.
{Ed: This is a stalled image, and the note is for failed images.}

274:[14:7+] Delete the final sentence of NOTE 5.8: "An image
... reason."
{Ed: Duplicate of previous edit.}

253r2:[14:7+] Add a Note 5.10

"In addition to detecting that an image has failed by having the
variable in a STAT=specifier or a STAT argument of a call to a
collective or atomic subroutine assigned the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE,
an image can get the indices of failed images in a specified team by
invoking the intrinsic function FAILED_IMAGES."

250r2:[14:7+] At the beginning of the new subclause 5.9 insert a new
paragraph:
"If the processor has the ability to detect that an image has stalled,
the value of the default integer constant STAT_STALLED_IMAGE is
positive; otherwise the value of STAT_STALLED_IMAGE is
negative. STAT_STALLED_IMAGE is defined in the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  If the processor detects that an image involved in
execution of an image control statement or a collective subroutine has
stalled, the value of STAT_STALLED_IMAGE is assigned to the variable
specified in a STAT=specifier in an execution of an image control
statement, or the STAT argument in an invocation of a collective
procedure. If the STAT= specifier of an execution of a CHANGE TEAM,
FORM TEAM, SYNC ALL, SYNC IMAGES, or SYNC TEAM statement is assigned
the value STAT_STALLED_IMAGE, the intended action shall have taken
place for all the active images involved.  If more than one nonzero
status value is valid for the execution of a statement, the status
variable is defined with a value other than STAT_STALLED_IMAGE."

Ed:[14:7+] Modify the edit above to move the second sentence
"STAT_STALLED_IMAGE is defined in the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV." to the end of the paragraph. {Matches the style of
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in 5.8.}

250r2:[14:7+] At the end of the paragraph moved from [14:5-7], add
"If an <image-selector> identifies an image that has failed and a team
that is the initial team, the executing image becomes a stalled
image for the rest of the execution of the program."

253r2:[14:7+] Add a Note 5.11 to the end of the new subclause 5.9: "In
addition to detecting that an image has stalled by having the variable
in a STAT=specifier or a STAT argument of a call to a collective
subroutine assigned the value STAT_STALLED_IMAGE, an image can get the
indices of stalled images in a specified team by invoking the
intrinsic function STALLED_IMAGES."


Edits for Clause 6 - Events
---------------------------

274:[15:13] Replace "INTEGER with KIND of ATOMIC_INT_KIND defined"
with "integer with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND, where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is a
named constant". (compare with 7.4.1 ATOM argument description).

274:[15:28] Insert a blank before the left parenthesis.

274:[15:32] Delete "the" before "execution".

274:[16:6] Insert a blank before the left parenthesis.

274:[16:11] Replace "UNTIL_COUNT ... with" with "<scalar-int-expr> if
the UNTIL_COUNT specifier appears and <scalar-int-expr> has".

". {Ed: Omitting the commas.}

265:[17:29] Delete "EVENT,". {Ed: Also deleted comma before EVENT.}

265:[17:31] Change "the argument" to "the STAT argument".

261:[17:32+] Delete NOTE 7.1

274:[17:Note 7.2, line 1] Replace "These properties" with "The
properties of atomic subroutines". {Ed: to avoid repetition, change
the immediately following "the use of atomic subroutines" to "their
use".}

250r2:Change every occurrence of "nonfailed" to "active", except
[18:2, 18:4, 18:6].

250r2:[18:2, 18:4, 18:6] Delete "nonfailed".

250r2:[18:18-19] Change "if no ... failed" to "if all images of the
current team are active".

250r2:[18:20]. Change "or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE" to ", STAT_FAILED_IMAGE,
or STAT_STALLED_IMAGE".

250r2:[18:21-22] Replace by "Otherwise, if an image of the current
team has been detected as failed, the argument is assigned the value
of the constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE. Otherwise, if an image of the
current team has been detected as stalled, the argument is assigned
the value of the constant STAT_STALLED_IMAGE."

"7.4.18a STALLED_IMAGES([TEAM, KIND])

<<Description.>> Indices of stalled images.

<<Class.>> Transformational function.

<<Arguments.>>

TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar of the type TEAM_TYPE defined in
the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. Its value shall represent an
ancestor team.

KIND (optional) shall be a scalar integer constant expression. Its
value shall be the value of a kind type parameter for the type
INTEGER. The range for integers of this kind shall be at least as
large as for default integer.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Integer. If KIND is present, the kind type
parameter is that specified by the value of KIND; otherwise, the kind
type parameter is that of default integer type. The result is an array
of rank one whose size is equal to the number of images in the
specified team that are known by the invoking image to have stalled.

<<Result Value.>> If TEAM is present, its value specifies the team;
otherwise, the team specified is the current team. The elements of the
result are the values of the image indices of the known stalled images
in the specified team, in numerically increasing order.

<<Examples.>> If image 3 is the only stalled image in the current team,
STALLED_IMAGES() has the value [3]. If there are no images in the
current team that are known by the invoking image to have stalled,
STALLED_IMAGES() is a zero-sized array.

273:[27:6+] In the new STALLED_IMAGES intrinsic, in the TEAM argument
description, Replace "an ancestor" with "the current or an ancestor".

250r2:[29:9] Change "failed" to "failed or stalled".

274:[29:11] Replace "such" with "error".

254r1:[29:13-14] Delete "the optional argument FAILED".
{Ed: Also deleted "and" following "FAILED" and "additional" following
"two". Don't need "additional" if have "adding" two words
earlier. Finally, change "any" to "either" near end of the sentence -
there are only two additions now.}

274:[29:16] Delete "the" before "type"

273:[29:17] Replace "an ancestor" with "the current or an ancestor".

Ed:[29:18] Change "positive scalar integer" to "positive integer
scalar".  {Match convention of "scalar" last.}

254r1:[29:20-22] Delete paragraph.

274:[29:22] Replace the comma with a semicolon.
{Ed: Not done. Text deleted by above edit.}

274:[29:27] Delete "the" before "type"


Edits for Clause 8 - Required editorial changes to [Fortran 2008]
-----------------------------------------------------------------

274:[31:19] Delete "powerful".  Belongs in a sales brochure.

274:[31:21] Delete "tagged" (the term is not defined anywhere).

Ed:[31:23] Change "have failed" to "have stalled or failed". {Missing
edit for stalled images.}

274:[31:33+] Copy the definition of "established coarray" here, with
heading 1.3.68a. {Ed: Missing edit.}

Ed:[32:1-] Move term "active image" here as 1.3.83a.

Ed:[32:1] Change 1.3.85a to 1.3.83b so that failed image is a subclass
of image.

250r2:[32:4] Before "has not initiated" insert "is not a stalled image
or".  {Ensure stalled and failed are distinct states.}

Ed:[32:3-5] Change definition of failed image to:
"an image for which references or definitions of a variable on the
image fail when that variable should be accessible; or an image that
is not a stalled image, is not a stopped image, and fails to respond
during the execution of an image control statement or a reference to a
collective subroutine (5.8)"
{With the edit in 250r2, the definition has too many instances of "or"
making it hard to parse. Cleaned up version.}

250r2:[32:5+] Add
"1.3.132a
<<stalled image>>
An image that has encountered an <image-selector> that identifies an
image that has failed and has not yet executed an END TEAM statement
that makes it active again." {Ed: "An" -> "an". Change subclause
number to be a subclass of "image" -> 1.3.83c}

274:[32:38] Replace "of" with "in".

274:[32:39] Replace "of" with "in".

images in a team.}

274:[33:8] Delete the space between "LOCK_TYPE" and the comma.

274:[33:18] Insert a comma before "or" twice. {Ed: First comma not
added. The "if either appears" includes both the team variable and
team_id.}

Ed:[33:23] Insert "\uwave{active}" after "every". {Missing edit for
limiting execution to active images.}

274:[34:4] Insert "in the current team" after "images".

274:[34:5] Insert "of the named constant" before "STAT_FAILED_IMAGE".

274:[34:12] Replace "value of" with "values of the named constants".

250r2:[34:6] After "(13.8.2)" add "{\ul ; otherwise, if a stalled
image is detected and execution is otherwise successful, the STAT=
specifier is assigned the value STAT_STALLED_IMAGE in the intrinsic
module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.}"

274:[34:10] Insert "named" before "constant".

250r2:[34:12-13]. Change "or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE" to ",
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, or STAT_STALLED_IMAGE".

250r2:[34:17] Change "failed" to "failed or stalled".

274:[34:24] Replace "of the current" with "in the current".

274:[34:25] Replace "of the current" with "in the current".

251:[35:13] Replace "image \uwave{in the team}" with "image \uwave{in
the current team}, and replace "as many times as has image M" by "as
many times as has image M {\uwave since execution last began in this
team}".

274:[35:16] Change "3" to "4".

274;[35:21+] Add para:
"Execution of a SYNC IMAGES statement performs a synchronization of
the image with each of the other \uwave{active} images in the
<image-set>.  Executions of SYNC IMAGES statements on images M and T
correspond if the number of times image M has executed a SYNC IMAGES
statement \uwave{in the current team} with T in its image set
\uwave{since execution last began in this team} is the same as the
number of times image T has executed a SYNC IMAGES statement \uwave{in
the current team} with M in its image set \uwave{since execution last
began in this team}. The segments that executed before the SYNC IMAGES
statement on either image precede the segments that execute after the
corresponding SYNC IMAGES statement on the other image."

274:[35:28] Insert "of the named constant" before "STAT_FAILED_IMAGE".
{Ed: Similar modification to the edit at [35:29].}

250r2:[35:29] After "(13.8.2)" add "; otherwise, if a stalled image is
detected and execution is otherwise successful, the STAT= specifier
is assigned the value STAT_STALLED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."

274:[35:32] Insert "value of the named" before "constant".

274:[35:35] Replace "value of" with "values of the named constants".

250r2:[35:35]. Change "or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE" to
", STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, or STAT_STALLED_IMAGE".

274:[35:39] Delete "argument" (statements don't have arguments).

267r1:[35:40] Change "is that specified as its <image-set>" to "is the
union of its <image-set> and the executing image".

267r1:[35:40] Change "The image" to "The images".

267r1:[35:41] Change "statement is that" to "statement are the one".
{Ed: Changed "one" to "ones".}

267r1:[35:41] At the end of "local variable is located", append the
following: "and the executing image".

267r1:[35:42] Change "The image" to "The images".

267r1:[35:42] Change "statement is that" to "statement are the one".
{Ed: Changed "one" to "ones".}

267r1:[35:43] At the end of "event variable is located", append the
following: "and the executing image".

250r2:[36:1, 36:2, 36:9] Change "failed" to "failed or stalled".

274:[36:18] Replace "of" with "in".

Ed:[36:24] Delete "and 7.2". {One of the notes was deleted.}

Ed:[36:26] Change "NOTES" to "NOTE". {Only one note remains in the
subclause.}

250r2:[37:1-] Before the line for STOPPED_IMAGES add
STALLED_IMAGES  ([TEAM, KIND])     T   Indices of stalled images

274:[37:1-] In the entry for EVENT QUERY, Delete ", ERRMSG".
Reason. None of the other atomic subroutines have an ERRMSG argument.

274:[37 in the list of new entries for the table in 13.5, for
EVENT_QUERY] Insert "variable" after "event".

254r1:[37:3+] In the entry for NUM_IMAGES, delete "[FAILED]" thrice.

Ed:[37:5] Change "7.4.20" to "7.4.21". {Added STALLED_IMAGES
intrinsic.}

Ed:[38:4] Change "shall be a scalar of type integer" to "shall be an
integer scalar with a decimal range of at least four". {Overlooked
edit. Make consistent with the other STAT arguments to atomics.}

Ed:[38:8] Change "shall be a scalar of type integer" to "shall be an
integer scalar with a decimal range of at least four". {Overlooked
edit. Make consistent with the other STAT arguments to atomics.}

274:[38:18] Delete "the" before "type"

273:[38:19] Replace "an ancestor" with "the current or an ancestor".

Ed:[38:20] Change "positive scalar integer" to "positive integer
scalar".  {Match convention of "scalar" last.}

274:[38:29] Change "shall be a scalar of type default integer" to
"shall be a default integer scalar".
{Ed: Changed to match the other STAT variables.}

274:[38:30] Replace "scalar of type default character" with "default
character scalar".

254r1:[39:1-2] Delete "[FAILED]" thrice. {Ed: also delete comma in 2
cases.}

274:[39:5] Delete "the" before "type"

273:[39:6] Replace "an ancestor" with "the current or an ancestor".

Ed:[39:7] Change "positive scalar integer" to "positive integer
scalar".  {Match convention of "scalar" last.}

254r1:[39:9-10] Delete paragraph for FAILED.

254r1:[39:14-16] Delete paragraph for FAILED.  {Ed: This deleted too
much - the result value no longer says that num_images returns the
number of images. Kept "The result is the number of images in the
specified team."}

274:[39:23] Delete "the" before "type"

273:[39:24] Replace "an ancestor" with "the current or an ancestor".

250r2:[40:15+] Add a new edit:
"In 13.8.2 The ISO FORTRAN ENV intrinsic module, insert a new
subclause 13.8.2.23a consisting of subclause 5.8 STAT_STALLED_IMAGE of
this Technical Specification, but omitting the second sentence of the
first paragraph." {Ed: Change 5.8 to 5.9 - that's the
STAT_STALLED_IMAGE subclause.}

253r2:[40:15+] Add
"{In 13.8.2.24 STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, edit the paragraph as follows.}

The value of the default integer scalar constant STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE is
assigned to the variable specified in a STAT= specifier (6.7.4, 8.5.7)
\uwave{or a STAT argument in a call to a collective subroutine} if
execution of the statement with that specifier or argument requires
synchronization with an image that has initiated termination of
execution. This value shall be positive \sout{and different from the
value of IOSTAT INQUIRE INTERNAL UNIT}."

253r2:[40:15+] Add
"{In 13.8.2.24 STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, insert a new Note after
paragraph 1}

"In addition to detecting that an image has initiated normal
termination by having the variable in a STAT=specifier or a STAT
argument of a call to a collective subroutine assigned the value
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, an image can get the indices of the images that
have initiated normal termination in a specified team by invoking the
intrinsic function STOPPED_IMAGES."

250r2:[40:21] Before "STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE" insert "STAT_STALLED_IMAGE,
".  {Insert STAT_STALLED_IMAGE in the list of constants with distinct
values.}

Ed:[40:36] Change "{At the end" to "{In 16.6.7, at the end" and delete
"in 6.6.7" later in the line. {Use consistent style for editing
instructions.}

274:[41:11] Add subclause number " (13.8.2.21b)" after "to fail".

274:[41:12] Add subclause number " (8.4a)" after "is made available".

274:[41:13] Add subclause number " (13.7.42e)" after "CO_SUM intrinsic
subroutine".

274:[41:14] Add subclause number " (13.7.42d)" after "CO_REDUCE
intrinsic subroutine".

274:[41:15] Add subclause number " (8.5.2a)" after "with each other".

274:[41:16] Add subclause number " (8.5.2c)" after "without a
NEW_INDEX= specifier".
{Ed: Fixed typo in exit instructions.}



Edits to Annex A - Extended notes
---------------------------------

Ed:[43:9] After "ISO_FORTRAN_ENV" insert ", ONLY: TEAM_TYPE". {Make
style consistent with program example changes in Note 5.3 and at
[26:15] and [26:22].}

Ed:[44:6] After "ISO_FORTRAN_ENV" insert ", ONLY: team_type,
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE". {Make style consistent with program example
changes in Note 5.3 and at [26:15] and [26:22].}



Part II: Additional edits to N2027:
===================================

1) Global edit: Change "the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module" to "the
   intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV". Thirteen instances changed.

   {The TS document has multiple instances of "the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
   intrinsic module" and also "the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV",
   leading to style inconsistency. The second form is used in the base
   Fortran standard.  The exception is as the title of 13.8.2.}

2) Add a definition of "stopped image" in clause 3 and 8.3.
   "stopped image
    an image that has initiated normal termination"

   {We have intrinsics for FAILED_IMAGES (7.4.16), STALLED_IMAGES
   (7.4.19), and STOPPED_IMAGES (7.4.20).  But terms for only failed
   images and stalled images. This seems not symmetric.  Also,
   "stopped image" is a simpler fit in several locations elsewhere in
   the text.}

3) At [19:13] change "to its previous value plus 42" to "defined with
   the value 46 if the value of I[3] was 4 when the atomic operation
   executed".

   {The wording style for the example in ATOMIC_ADD did not match the
   style in other atomic subroutines.  Also the word "previous" was
   too vague.}

4) At [25:36] change "failed image in the current team" to "image in
   the current team that is known by the invoking image to have
   failed".

   {Use wording like that of the sentence that follows, and in the
   Result Value text.}

5) [27:6+] In the new STALLED_IMAGES function, make the same change as
   the edit (4) above, except replace "failed" by "stalled".

   {Use wording like that of the sentence that follows, and in the
   Result Value text.}

6) At [29:24] in 7.5.5 THIS_IMAGE, change "THIS_IMAGE( )" to
   "THIS_IMAGE".

   {All of the forms of THIS_IMAGE are getting the optional TEAM
   argument, not just the form that has no argument in F2008.}

7) At [33:8-9] Delete this edit.

   {The current text allows for the direct accessing of remote data in
   the current team. The new syntax allows for accessing all the
   images through the initial team, so this limitation is misleading.}

8) At [32:35+] following the edit for 2.3.4, insert a new edit:

   "{After 2.3.5 Execution sequence, insert a new subclause
   "2.3.6 Image execution states" consisting of five paragraphs, with
   the third paragraph consisting of the second paragraph and Note 5.8
   of 5.8 STAT_FAILED_IMAGE of this Technical Specification, the
   fourth and fifth paragraphs consisting of the second and third
   paragraphs of 5.9 STAT_STALLED_IMAGE of this Technical
   Specification, and the first and second paragraphs as follows.}

   A stopped image is an image that has initiated termination of
   execution.

   An active image is an image that is not a failed image, a stalled
   image, or a stopped image."


   At [40:13-14] In the edit moving 5.8 STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, change
   "consisting of subclause 5.8" to "consisting of the first paragraph
   and Notes 5.9 and 5.10 of subclause 5.8".

   In the 150r2:[40:15+] in Part I, in the edit moving 5.9
   STAT_STALLED_IMAGE, change "consisting of subcaluse 5.9" to
   "consisting of the first paragraph and Note of subcaluse 5.9", and
   change "second" to "final".

   {The current subclause 8.9 edits to move the descriptions of
   STAT_FAILED_IMAGE and STAT_STALLED_MAGE to Clause 13 of F2015
   including moving the paragraphs defining a failed image and stalled
   image to 13.8.2.x. These definitions belong in 2.3.x of F2015,
   where we discuss images and program execution. The edits here move
   these definitions to a new 2.3.6 and omit them from the text moved
   to 13.8.2.x.}


Part III: Technical corrections to N2027:
=========================================


1) At [16:7] change "UNTIL_COUNT = <scalar-int-expr>" to
   "<until-spec>", add a new rule "R604a <until-spec> <<is>>
   UNTIL_COUNT = <scalar-int-expr" and add a constrint "C605a (R603)
   An <until-spec> shall not appear more than once in an
   <event-wait-stmt>."

   {Overlooked constraint. Multiple UNTIL_COUNT= specifiers in the
   same EVENT WAIT statement are not reasonable and should be
   disallowed.}


2) The TEAM_ID function and the modifications to IMAGE_INDEX and
   NUM_IMAGES do not account for the possibility that the optional
   TEAM argument represents the initial team.  A team_id value is
   associated with execution of FORM TEAM.  There is no concept of the
   "team id" in the initial team.  There are two alternatives for a
   fix:

   a) Require that the specified team is not the initial team.

   b) If the specified team is the initial team, then TEAM_ID( )
      result value is -1 (indicating an invalid value), and the
      TEAM_ID arguments to IMAGE_INDEX and NUM_IMAGES are ignored if
      they are present.

   Alternative (b) seems more friendly to programmers, so edits are
   added to implement that option.

   [27:35-37] In 7.4.20 TEAM_ID replace the Result Value description
   with: "If TEAM is present its value specifies the team; otherwise,
   the team specified is the current team.  If the specified team is
   the initial team, the result is -1; otherwise, the result value is
   the team identifier of the invoking image in the specified team."

   [28:22] In 7.5.2 IMAGE_INDEX, para 3, change "Its value shall be"
   to "If the current team is the initial team, its value is
   ignored. Otherwise, its value shall be".

   [29:18] In 7.5.4 NUM_IMAGES, para 3, change "Its value shall be" to
   "If the current team is the initial team, its value is
   ignored. Otherwise, its value shall be".

   [38:20] In the TEAM_ID argument edits for IMAGE_INDEX, change "Its
   value shall be" to "If the current team is the initial team, its
   value is ignored. Otherwise, its value shall be".

   [38:22] Delete "or TEAM_ID". {The TEAM_ID argument does not specify
   a team.}

   [39:7] In the TEAM_ID argument edits for NUM_IMAGES, change "Its
   value shall be" to "If the current team is the initial team, its
   value is ignored. Otherwise, its value shall be".

   [39:13] Delete "or TEAM_ID". {The TEAM_ID argument does not specify
   a team. Also move this paragraph to be part of the argument
   description, not part of the result value.


3) In 7.5.5 THIS_IMAGE, the second sentence of para 2 says of the TEAM
   argument "It shall not be a coarray."  This is obsolete, and should
   have been the same as the corresponding text in 7.5.4 for
   NUM_IMAGES. The same TEAM argument would usually be used for both
   functions and should have the same requirements.

   [29:28] Change "It shall be a coarray." to "Its value shall
   represent the current or an ancestor team."

   [39:24] Delete "It shall be a coarray."


4) Subclause 13.8.2.24 STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE of 14-007r2, says that if an
   image involved in a collective activity has stopped, then the
   status variable is assigned STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE.  The 5.8 of N2027
   says that if a failed image is detected, STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is
   assigned to the status variable. Since multiple images would
   normally be involved with the collective activity, it is possible
   for that set to include both a stopped image and a failed image.
   This situation would make the requirements on the value of the
   status variable contradictory. This is a defect in 5.8, as there
   was no intention to change the priority implied in 13.8.2.24.  The
   new TS text 5.9 for stalled images has the same defect.  The
   intention is that when there are multiple valid options for the
   status value, the first in the following list is selected:
   STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, any valid value not in this list,
   STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, and lastly, STAT_STALLED_IMAGE. The wording in
   TS subclauses 5.8 and 5.9 is fixed to correct the defects, and the
   sentences rearranged to bring related sentences closer together. As
   a side effect, the edits for moving the text to the base standard
   are simplified.

   [13:14-14:4] In the second sentence, after "and does so," insert "
   and no error condition other than a failed image or a stalled image
   is detected,", and rearrange the sentences and paragraph breaks to
   that it reads as follows:

      If the processor has the ability to detect that an image has
      failed, the value of the default integer scalar constant
      STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is positive; otherwise, the value of
      STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is negative.  If the processor has the ability
      to detect that an image involved in execution of an image
      control statement or a collective or atomic subroutine has
      failed and does so, and no error condition other than a failed
      image or a stalled image is detected, the value of
      STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is assigned to the variable specified in a
      STAT=specifier in an execution of an image control statement, or
      the STAT argument in an invocation of a collective or atomic
      procedure.  If more than one nonzero status value other than
      STAT_STALLED_IMAGE is valid for the execution of a statement,
      the status variable is defined with a value other than
      STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.  If the STAT= specifier of an execution of a
      CHANGE TEAM, END TEAM, FORM TEAM, SYNC ALL, SYNC IMAGES, or SYNC
      TEAM statement is assigned the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, the
      intended action shall have taken place for all the active images
      involved.

      STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is defined in the intrinsic module
      ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  The values of the named constants
      IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT, STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, STAT_LOCKED,
      STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE, STAT_STALLED_IMAGE, STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE,
      and STAT_UNLOCKED shall be distinct.

      A failed image is one for which references or definitions of a
      variable on the image fail when that variable should be
      accessible; or an image that is not a stalled image, is not a
      stopped image, and fails to respond during the execution of an
      image control statement or a reference to a collective
      subroutine. A failed image remains failed for the remainder of
      the program execution.  The conditions that cause an image to
      fail are processor dependent.

   [40:14-15] In the instructions for moving 5.8 to clause 13 of the
   base standard, delete ", but omitting the final two sentences of
   the first paragraph". {Those sentences are now a separate
   paragraph.}

   [14:5-7] In the new 5.9 text for STAT_STALLED_IMAGE, after "and
   does so," insert " and no error condition is detected,", and
   rearrange the sentences and paragraph breaks to that it reads as
   follows:

      If the processor has the ability to detect that an image has
      stalled, the value of the default integer constant
      STAT_STALLED_IMAGE is positive; otherwise the value of
      STAT_STALLED_IMAGE is negative.  If the processor detects that
      an image involved in execution of an image control statement or
      a collective subroutine has stalled, and no other error
      condition is detected, the value of STAT_STALLED_IMAGE is
      assigned to the variable specified in a STAT=specifier in an
      execution of an image control statement, or the STAT argument in
      an invocation of a collective procedure.  If more than one
      nonzero status value is valid for the execution of a statement,
      the status variable is defined with a value other than
      STAT_STALLED_IMAGE.  If the STAT= specifier of an execution of a
      CHANGE TEAM, FORM TEAM, SYNC ALL, SYNC IMAGES, or SYNC TEAM
      statement is assigned the value STAT_STALLED_IMAGE, the intended
      action shall have taken place for all the active images
      involved.

      STAT_STALLED_IMAGE is defined in the intrinsic module
      ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

      If an \si{image-selector} identifies an image that has failed
      and a team other than the initial team, the executing image
      becomes a stalled image for the rest of the execution of the
      corresponding CHANGE TEAM block. The executing image shall
      transfer control to the END TEAM statement of the construct
      after execution of all finalizations and deallocations that
      would have occurred during the normal completion of active
      procedures invoked within the CHANGE TEAM block, without
      synchronization of coarray deallocations.

      If an \si{image-selector} identifies an image that has failed
      and a team that is the initial team, the executing image becomes
      a stalled image for the rest of the execution of the program.

   [40:17] In the instructions for moving 5.9 to clause 13 of the base
   standard, delete ", but omitting the final sentence of the first
   paragraph". {That sentence is now a separate paragraph.}
