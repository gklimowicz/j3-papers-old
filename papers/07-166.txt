References: J3/07-007, UTI 106

UTI 106 asks just how much of the action of the FLUSH 
statement is processor dependent.  Subgroup believes that
the old F2003 action is processor dependent and the new
co-array flush actions are required.  An edit is supplied to
make this clear.  The UTI can be removed.

Edits:
Make the last sentence a clause of the second sentence
and slightly reword it to be plural.
[247:3]  Replace "statement.  The action is processor dependent."
with
"statement; these actions are processor dependent."
