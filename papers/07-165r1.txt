Subject:    Clause 13: RESHAPE SHAPE size, other stuff
Date:       2007 February 15
References: J3/07-007

[419:22]  The description for the SHAPE argument to RESHAPE says it
must have "constant size".  Does this mean the size is limited to
constants, or to initialization expressions, or is it a restriction on
variables used in the dimension to not change?

Could I do something like
       deallocate (shape)
       read *, N
       allocate (shape(N))
is it OK if I consistently enter the same number for N every time?

Assuming we don't need an interp about this,

Proposed edit:
[419:22+1-23]
Replace ``shall ... positive'' by ``shall be a rank-one integer.
SIZE(SHAPE) shall be an initialization expression whose value is
positive''.

Other changes:

[419:24]
Insert ``an array'' after first ``be'' and delete ``It shall be an
array.''

[380:25]
Replace ``7.12'' by ``7.3 for relational intrinsic operations
(7.1.5.6.1)''.
