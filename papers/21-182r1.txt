Discussion
----------

I think I have found some glitches associated with enumeration type in
US 21. Edits are suggested. Some of the edits in the r0 are superseded by
21-190; one edit was superseded by 21-189r1.
 
Edits to 21-007r2
-----------------

[91:21-23] In 7.6.2 Enumerations types, in para 4 R771 and in para 6, 
change "int-expr" to "scalar-int-expr" thrice so that the text reads

"R771 enumeration-constructor is enumeration-type-spec (scalar-int-expr)

An enumeration constructor returns the value of the enumeration type 
whose ordinal position is the value of the scalar-int-expr. The 
scalar-int-expr shall have a value that is positive and less than or 
equal to the number of enumerators in the enumeration type's 
definition."

[92:NOTE 1 (cont). In 7.6.2 Enumerations types, NOTE 1, 
subroutine wcheck, line 4, change "w 1" to "w1" so that the line reads
    Print *,'w1 selected'
