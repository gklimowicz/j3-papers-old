---------------------

In 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 4, at the end of the 
sentence 
"If the coarray is an ultimate component of a dummy argument, the 
ultimate arguments on those images shall be declared with the same name 
in the same scoping unit."
add 
"; if the ultimate argument is an unsaved local variable of a recursive 
procedure, the execution of the ALLOCATE statement shall be at the same 
depth of recursion of that procedure on every active image in the 
current team".
