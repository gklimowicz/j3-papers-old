Date:  15 October 1997
TO:    J3
FROM:  Larry Rolison
SUBJ:  Increased statement length (specs, syntax, edits)


Specification:
----------------

Section 3.3.1.4 "Free form statements" states:

    A free form statement shall not have more than 39 continuation lines.

Section 3.3.2.3 "Fixed form statements" states:

    A fixed form statement shall not have more than 19 continuation lines.

JOR item 75 (WG5 repository item 50) seeks to extend the number of continuation
lines allowed in order to be able to initialize large arrays with individual
values and other such uses.  The JOR item suggested removing the limitation
on free source form continuation entirely.  It did not address fixed source
form.  At meeting 137, the committee voted 12/5/1 on the straw vote

    longer limit on number of continuation lines /
    no limit on number of continuation lines     /
    undecided

When I asked "how many is more?", there was no consensus.  The only remark I
remember is someone half-jokingly saying at least "2 * current_limit + 1".
Since there was no number specified by the committee, I am suggesting the
limit be raised to 99 continuation lines because this produces an
easily-remembered 100 line total line statement length limit.  Even though
the JOR item did not mention fixed source form and even though fixed source
form is on the obsolescent list, this paper also specifies that the
continuation line limit be raised to 99 for fixed source form as well to make
the limits the same and easier to remember.  I also contend that raising the
limit for fixed source form is a reasonable thing to do because

  (1) fixed source form is going to exist forever in Fortran compilers no
      matter what J3 says, and

  (2) vendors generally have already extended the limit, particularly to 99
      lines so the change would standardize existing practice.


Syntax:
--------

There are no syntax changes to the language.  The change will not affect any
current implementation of Fortran 90/95, other than making one more extension
a standard feature when Fortran 95 compilers are migrated to Fortran 2000
compilers.


Edits:
------

1. Section 3.3.1.4, last sentence [27:5], change "39" to "99".
2. Section 3.3.2.4, third to last sentence [27:35-36], change "19" to "99".
