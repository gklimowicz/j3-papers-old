QUESTION:

Does the following program unit conform to the 2003 Fortran standard?

  subroutine S ( N )

    character(3) :: c(2)

    data ( c(i)(n:n), i = 1, 2 ) / 'A', 'B' /

  end subroutine s

ANSWER:

No.

A <data-i-do-object> is required to be an <array-element> or a
<structure-component> (see R528 [87:31-32]).

An <array-element> is only a <data-ref> with some extra constraints
(see R616 [107:10]).

A <data-ref> ends with a <part-ref> and does not include a
<substring-range> (see R612 and R613, [105:1-2]).

Therefore c(i)(n:n) is not an array element.
Similarly, a <structure-component> is a <data-ref>, and therefore
c(i)(n:n) is not a structure component either.

Therefore there is a syntax error in the third line of the program unit.

EDITS: None.
