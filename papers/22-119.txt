This is to amplify a comment in the UK ballot on the Fortran CD
(22-007).

The reference to the C standard should be to the current edition
(9899:2018) rather than to the withdrawn one (9899:2011).  Since page
476 of the 2018 C standard states 'There are no major changes in this
edition (__STDC_VERSION__ 201710L), only technical corrections and
clarifications' the only change needed to the Fortran draft is a
global edit of 9899:2011 to 9899:2018.

In further detail: There are 38 references to the C standard, ten of
which do not specify a subclause.  Seventeen of the referenced
subclauses are unchanged in the 2018 C standard.  These are 3.2,
5.1.2.2.3, 6.2.2, 6.2.7, 6.3.2.3, 6.4.3, 6.5.3.2, 6.5.3.4, 6.5.9,
6.7.2.2, 7.13, 7.14.1, 7.16, 7.19, 7.20.1, 7.21.2 and 7.22.4.4.

Three referenced subclauses have insignificant text changes
('International Standard' changed to 'document').  These are 3.4.3,
5.2.1 (twice) and 5.2.2.

Four referenced subclauses have text changes but they do not affect
the meaning so far as Fortran is concerned.  These are:

3.4.3
Para 3: Note 2 added, viz 'J.2 gives an overview over properties of C
programs that lead to undefined behavior.'

6.2.4
Para 8 'or full declarator' deleted after 'containing full
expression'; also added: 'An object with temporary lifetime behaves as
if it were declared with the type of its value for the purposes of
effective type. Such an object need not have a unique address'. Also
in forward ref added: 'effective type (6.5)'

6.2.5
Para 6 'corresponding unsigned integer type' changed from roman to
italic.  Para 18 added new note 46: Annex H documents the extent to
which the C language supports the ISO/IEC 10967-1 standard for
language-independent arithmetic (LIA-1).

6.7.6.3
Para 5: 'returning T' changed to 'returning the unqualified version
of T'.

Edits to 22-007
---------------

[2:7] Change '9899:2011' to '9899:2018' and perform a global edit
throughout the remainder of the document.

Note: The following C standard is a major revision and is scheduled to
be published at the end of 2023.
