Introduction
------------

Constraint C1555 [330:33-34, 15.6.2.1p6, Procedures defined by
subprograms] says: "A variable that is a dummy argument of a procedure
that has a proc-language-binding-spec shall be assumed-type or of
interoperable type." This does not account for the possibility that
not all kinds of a type are interoperable for a given processor.
