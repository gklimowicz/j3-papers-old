NUMBER: 000067
TITLE:  writing zeros
KEYWORDS:  list-directed output, namelist output
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS:  J3 consideration in progress

The standard currently requires a real zero to be
written in exponential form when using list-directed
or namelist output.

QUESTION: Is this requirement intentional or an oversight?

ANSWER: The requirement is an oversight.

DISCUSSION:
The G edit descriptor was changed in Fortran 90 to format a real zero as
if an F edit descriptor were provided in most cases.  The same change
was not made for list-directed or namelist output, but should have.

             Sections 10.5.4.1.2, 10.8.2, and 10.9.2.1

EDITS:

| For Fortran 95:
|   In section 1.5.1, after the last paragraph, add the following as list
|   item (3):

|	(3) List directed and namelist output statements produce a real
|	    literal constant zero for a real value that is zero, and
|	    for the real or imaginary part of a complex value that is zero.
|	    In Fortran 95, these real literal constants are produced with
|	    the effect of an F edit descriptor, instead of an E edit descriptor.


    and in section 10.8.2 (List-directed output), fifth paragraph, [177:41],
    change "If the magnitude x is within this range" to
        "If the magnitude x is within this range or is zero"

    and in section 10.9.2.1 (Namelist output editing), third paragraph,
    [182:33], change "If the magnitude x is within this range" to
        "If the magnitude x is within this range or is zero"

  For 99-007r2 (Fortran 2000):
    In section 1.5.2 (Fortran90 compatibility), add the following sentence
    to the end of the first paragraph.

|	"The following Fortran 90 features have different interpretations
|	 in this standard."

    and in section 1.5.2, turn the 2nd paragraph into list item (1),
    and add the following after the 2nd paragraph as list item (2).

|	(2) List directed and namelist output statements produce a real
|	    literal constant zero for a real value that is zero, and
|	    for the real or imaginary part of a complex value that is zero.
|	    In Fortran 2000, these real literal constants are produced with
|	    the effect of an F edit descriptor, instead of an E edit descriptor.


    and in section 10.9.2 (List-directed output), fifth paragraph, [246:10],
    change "If the magnitude x is within this range" to
        "If the magnitude x is within this range or is zero"

    and in section 10.10.2.1 (Namelist output editing), third paragraph,
    [251:4], change "If the magnitude x is within this range" to
        "If the magnitude x is within this range or is zero"
