Discussion

With the removal of hyphens from co-array, etc., the names "co_lbound"
and "co_ubound" are anomalous. We propose that they be replaced by
"lcobound" and "ucobound" to correspond better with "lbound" and
"ubound".

Edits to J3/08-007r2 (WG5/N1723):

Change every occurrence of "CO_LBOUND" to "LCOBOUND" and every
occurrence of "CO_UBOUND" to "UCOBOUND", then reorder Table 13.1 and
13.7 to restore alphabetic order.
