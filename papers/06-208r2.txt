Specification:
____________________

The proposed edits for the CONTIGUOUS attribute (see J3/05-273r2) 
introduce the concept of a contiguous array but do not complete the 
integration process with C Interop. 

In particular, C_LOC should be extended to return the base address of (run-time) 
contiguous array pointer or assumed-shape array (edits below).

Edits:

[475:24] In the first list in the description of the argument to
