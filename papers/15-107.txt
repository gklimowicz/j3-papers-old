1. Introduction
===============

Subclause 12.4.2.2, p1(1)(b), requires a procedure to have an explicit
interface if a reference to it appears in a context that requires it to
be pure.  This doesn't include appearance as an actual argument (because
that's not a reference).

Constraint C1293 requires the interface of a procedure to be pure if it
is used in a context that requires it to be pure.  This includes
appearance as an actual argument.

Subclause 12.4.2.2, p1(1)(b), requires intrinsic procedures to have
explicit interface if they are referenced in a context that requires
them to be pure.  C1293 explicitly exempts intrinsic procedures from
this requirement.

It would be helpful if 12.4.2.2 p1(1)(b) were consistent with C1293.

2. Edits
========

[283:21-23 12.4.2.2p1(1)] Replace list item (1):

"(1)  a reference to the procedure appears with an argument keyword
      (12.5.2), or
 (1a) the designator of the procedure appears in a context that requires
      it to be pure (12.7),
"

{Rather than agonize over why 12.4.2.2, p1(1)(b), requires intrinsic
procedures to have explicit interface if they are referenced in a
context that requires them to be pure, but C1293 explicitly exempts
intrinsic procedures from this requirement, it's easier to simplify
C1293, and specify that intrinsic procedures have explicit interface.}

[318:17-18 C1293] Replace the first sentence of the constraint with "If
the designator of a procedure \obs{that is not a statement function}
appears in a context that requires it to be pure, then its interface
shall be explicit in the scope of that appearance."

[331:3+ 13.7.1p1+] Insert a paragraph:

"All intrinsic procedures have explicit interface."
