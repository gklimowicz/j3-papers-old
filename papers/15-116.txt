UTI 011 requests an example for the GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE intrinsic
subroutine.

[357:35+ 13.7.68p4+] Insert the following paragraph:

"<<Example.>>  If the value of the environment variable CHARSET is
"iso8859", executing the statement

  CALL GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE ( "CHARSET", CHARSET )

would result in the value "iso8859" being assigned to the variable
CHARSET."
