Subject: Contradictions concerning execution sequence and branching

Paper 09-289r1 was passed at J3 m190 and was comment US-1 on the FCD
ballot (see N1802).  It is re-presented here with line numbers for
09-007r3.

1.  The second bullet of the list in 2.3.5p2 [33:17] claims that
    control constructs have "implicit internal branching".
    Contradicting that, 8.2.1p1 [186:17+] says "although ... control
    constructs can cause transfer of control, they are not branches."

[33:17 2.3.5p2]---------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "branching" by "transfer of control" in the second
bullet of the list to remove this contradiction.


2. The second sentence of 2.3.5p2 [33:8] says "within its scoping
   unit".  1.3.115 [15:31] says the scoping unit of a program unit or
   subprogram excludes any scoping units within it.  Therefore 2.3.5p2
   prohibits execution to proceed from the executable constructs of a
   main program or subprogram, across a  CONTAINS statement, and into
   an internal subprogram (because an internal subprogram is a different
   scoping unit).  Therefore the second sentence of 2.3.5p3 isn't needed.
   It is further harmful because it contradicts the provisions of 2.3.5p2
   relating to procedure invocation, since it says, without qualification,
   "The execution sequence excludes all such [internal procedure]
   definitions," which means internal procedures cannot be executed,
   notwithstanding that 2.3.5p2 explains how they are executed.

   The first sentence of 2.3.5p3 just restates R1101, R1227, and R1233,
   and it's a bit of a lie anyway, since an internal subprogram is a
   subprogram, but it can't contain an internal subprogram.  Without the
   need to introduce the second sentence it is out of place in 2.3.5.

[33:22-23 2.3.5p3]------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete the entire paragraph
