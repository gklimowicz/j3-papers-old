1. Introduction
This paper is a fresh request for two of the interpretations requested
in 19-181. 19-240 and 19-241 explain why the editor did not accept
them. Here, we make a fresh request to address the same problem. It is
self-contained and does not require the reader to consult 19-181,
19-240, or 19-241.

2. Questions
11.6.9 FORM TEAM statement, paragraph 2 says
"Successful execution of a FORM TEAM statement creates a new team for
each unique team-number value specified by the active images of the
current team."
Successful execution precludes the case where the team contains failed
images, see 11.6.11, so why does the adjective "active" appear here?

11.6.9 FORM TEAM statement, paragraph 6 says
"If execution of a FORM TEAM statement assigns the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE to the stat-variable, the effect is the same as for
the successful execution of FORM TEAM except for the value assigned
to stat-variable."
How can this be correct in the presence of failed images? Is the
intention that the effect is the same as if the team had consisted
just of the active images?

Do any of the new teams contain failed images?

3. Suggested response
The text in 11.6.8 was originally written when we regarded the
execution of a FORM TEAM statement in a team including failed
images as successful as long as no other errors occurred.
Paragraph 2 is about successful execution but actually describes
both situations. It would be much clearer to do this rather than
have paragragh 6 describe execution with failed images by referring
back to paragraph 2. In particular, it makes it clear that in the
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE case the new team does not include the images that
were detected as failed.

The new teams will usually contain no failed images. However, this
cannot be guaranteed because an image might fail while executing the
FORM TEAM statement.

4. Suggested edits
In 11.6.9 FORM TEAM statement
In p2 change
"Successful execution of a FORM TEAM statement" to
"Execution of a FORM TEAM statement that is successful or that
assigns the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE to the <stat-variable>".
Delete p6.
