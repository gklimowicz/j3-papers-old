QUESTION:

Can a SELECT RANK associate name appear in a variable definition 
context of a RANK (scalar-int-const-expr) or a RANK (*) rank case 
block?

Consider the following procedure:

  SUBROUTINE example (assumed_rank)
    REAL,DIMENSION(..) :: assumed_rank
    SELECT RANK (assoc_name => assumed_rank)
      RANK (0)              ! assoc_name is scalar
        assoc_name = 0.0    ! legal?
      RANK (*)              ! assoc_name is rank 1, DIMENSION(1:*)
        assoc_name = 1.0    ! legal?
      RANK DEFAULT          ! assoc_name is assume_rank
        assoc_name = -1.0   ! not legal
    END SELECT
  END SUBROUTINE

The rules in 11.1.10.3 state that assoc_name is scalar (RANK 0) in
the RANK (0) block.  In the RANK (*) rank case block, assoc_name 
is rank 1, assumed size with DIMENSION(1:*).  In the RANK DEFAULT 
rank case block, assoc_name is assumed rank.  

Constraint C838 restricts usage of an assume-rank object; it cannot 
be used in a variable definition context.  Thus, the assignment in
the RANK DEFAULT rank case block is not legal.

In section 11.1.10.4 Examples of SELECT RANK construct, note 1 
indicates the assignments in the RANK(0) and RANK(*) rank case 
blocks are legal.

Paragraph 5 of section 11.1.3.3 states "The associating
entity is itself a variable, but if the selector is not a definable
variable, the associating entity is not definable and shall not be
defined or become undefined.  If a selector is not permitted to 
appear in a variable definition context, neither the associate name 
or any subobject thereof shall appear in a variable definition
context."

A selector in a SELECT RANK construct must be assumed rank per
constraint C1150.  An assumed rank array is not permitted in a 
variable definition context. The words of 11.1.3.3 indicate
the assignments in the RANK (0) and the RANK (*) blocks, and the
first example in 11.1.10.4 to be non-conforming.

ANSWER:
A SELECT RANK associate name may appear in a variable definition 
context. 

Constraint C838 restricts the contexts where assumed rank
objects may appear; one of these is as an actual argument which is
a variable definition context.  19.6.7 Variable definition context
item 11 states that a variable that is a selector in a SELECT RANK 
construct can be defined if the corresponding associate name or any
subobject thereof appears in a variable definition context.

In a RANK (*) block of a SELECT RANK construct, the associate name 
is a one dimensional assumed size array with lower bound 1; in a RANK
(scalar-int-constant-expr) block the associate name has the rank 
specified by scalar-int-constant-expr. C838 does not apply in either
of these cases. 

In a SELECT RANK construct, the associate name is assumed rank only 
in the RANK DEFAULT block of the construct; constraint C838 applies 
to the associate name only in this block of the construct.  

No interpretation is needed.
