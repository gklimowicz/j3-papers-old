Subject: Issue 21 : co-subscripts mapping
Reference: J3/06-007


Discussion of Issue 21 (page 123)

The mapping from image selector is defined in 2.4.6 ([21:25-27]),
but it should be defined more rigorously here.

Edits to J3/06-007

[123:6] Replace "within the bounds" with "within the co-bounds".

[123:6] Before "An image" add "Taking account of the co-bounds, the
      sequence of co-subscripts in an image selector is mapped to an image
      index in the same way as a sequence of subscripts in an array element
      is mapped to the position of the array element in array element order
      (6.2.2.2), taking account of the bounds."
