Subject: JP-2: Statement functions and C506
Date: 2010 February 01

This paper provides edits for comment JP-2 from the Ballot summary,
N1802.

Discussion:

Constraint C506 at [88:11-14] lists the contexts where
<initialization> is not allowed in a type declaration statement.  If
the entity being declared is a statement function, initialization
should not be allowed. Statement functions are allowed as an
<entity-decl>, as is clear in C508.

Edits to J3/09-007r3:

[88:13] In 5.2.1 "Type declaration statements / Syntax", in the 3rd
constraint following "R503 <entity-decl> ..." (constraint C506),
before "or an automatic" insert "a statement function, " in
obsolescent font.
