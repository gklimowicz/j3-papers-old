Introduction
------------

This paper contains edits for simple procedures (US 15).
The requirements, specifications and syntax for imple
procedures are in paper 19-201r1.  The edits are with
respect to 18-007r1.


Edits
-----

"Introduction", bullet item "Program units and procedures",
page xiv
Insert
 "A procedure can be specified to be a simple procedure;
  a simple procedure does not define nonlocal variables
  and references nonlocal variables only via its dummy
  arguments."


3.112.5+, following "pure procedure", page 16:12+
Insert
 "simple procedure
  procedure declared or defined to be simple (15.7+)"


7.5.7.3 "Type-bound procedure overriding", paragraph 2,
page 82:15+
After the second bullet item, insert
 " * If the overridden type-bound procedure is simple then
     the overriding one shall also be simple."


10.2.2.4 "Procedure pointer assignment", paragraph 3,
page 167:7
Replace "not pure and"
with
 "not pure, the pointer target may be simple even if the
  pointer object is not simple, and"
The edited text is
 "If the pointer object has an explicit interface, its
  characteristics shall be the same as the pointer target
  except that the pointer target may be pure even if the
  pointer object is not pure, the pointer target may be
  simple even if the pointer object is not simple, and the
  pointer target may be an elemental intrinsic procedure
  even if the pointer object is not elemental."


15.3.1 "Characteristics of procedures", paragraph 1,
page 290:10
Replace "pure, whether"
with
 "pure, whether it is simple, whether"
The edited text is
 "The characteristics of a procedure are the classification
  of the procedure as a function or subroutine, whether it
  is pure, whether it is simple, whether it is elemental,
  whether it has the BIND attribute, the characteristics of
  its dummy arguments, and the characteristics of its
  function result if it is a function."


15.4.2.2 "Explicit interface", paragraph 1 following list
item (2), page 291:22+
Insert
 " (2+) the procedure is used in a context that requires it
        to be simple (15.7+),


15.4.3.2 "Interface block", paragraph 7, page 293:35
Replace "defined to be pure."
with
 "defined to be pure and the interface may specify a
  a procedure that is not simple even if the procedure is
  defined to be simple."


15.4.3.6 "Procedure declaration statement", paragraph 7,
page 299:37
Replace "is not pure \obs{and}"
with
 "is not pure, initial-proc-target may be simple even if
  procedure-entity-name is not simple, \obs{and}"


15.5.2.9 "Actual arguments associated with dummy procedure
entities", paragraph 1, page 309:4
Replace "is not pure \obs{and}"
with
 "is not pure, a simple effective argument may be
  associated with a dummy argument that is not simple,
  \obs{and}"


15.6.2.1 "General", at the end of the rule for "prefix-spec",
page 317:19+
Insert "    <<or>> SIMPLE".


15.6.2.1 "General",  following constraint C1544, page 317:21+
Insert
 "C1544+  (R1526) A prefix shall not specify both SIMPLE and
                  IMPURE."


15.6.2.1 "General", paragraph 4, page 317:39
Replace "If the prefix-spec PURE appears,"
with
 "If the prefix-spec PURE or the prefix-spec SIMPLE appears,"


15.6.2.1 "General", paragraph 4, page 317:40
Insert
 "If the prefix-spec SIMPLE appears, the subprogram is a
  simple subprogram and shall meet the additional constraints
  of 15.7+."
at the end of the paragraph.


15.7  "Pure procedures", paragraph 1, page 323:31-324:3
Replace the paragraph with
 "A pure procedure is

    * an intrinsic procedure (16.1), if it is specified to be
      pure or simple,

    * a module procedure in an intrinsic module, if it
      is specified to be pure or simple,

    * a procedure defined by a pure subprogram,

    * a dummy procedure that has been specified to be pure
      or simple,

    * a procedure pointer that has been specified to be
      pure or simple,

    * a type-bound procedure that is bound to a pure
      procedure, or

    * \obs{a statement function that references only pure functions
      and does not contain the designator of a variable with
      the VOLATILE attribute.}"


15.7 "Pure procedures", paragraph 2, page 324:4
Replace "has the prefix-spec PURE or"
with
 "has the prefix-spec PURE or the prefix-spec SIMPLE, or"


15.7+ "Simple procedures" (follows "Pure procedures"),
page 325:9-
Insert
 "15.7+ Simple procedures

  A simple procedure is

    * an intrinsic procedure (16.1), if it is specified to
      be simple,

    * a module procedure, if it is specified to be simple,

    * a procedure defined by a simple subprogram,

    * a dummy procedure that has been specified to be SIMPLE,

    * a procedure pointer that has been specified to be
      simple,

    * a type-bound procedure that is bound to a simple
      procedure, or

    * \obs{a statement function defined in a simple subprogram}.

  A simple procedure is also a pure procedure and is subject
  to the constraints for pure procedures (15.7).  A simple
  procedure can also be an elemental procedure.

  A simple subprogram is a subprogram that has the prefix-spec
  SIMPLE.  The following additional constraints apply to
  simple subprograms.

  C1599a The specification-part of a simple subprogram shall
         specify that all of its dummy procedures are simple.

  C1599b If a procedure that is not an intrinsic procedure, a
         module procedure of an intrinsic module, \obs{or a
         statement function} is used in a context that requires
         it to be simple, then its interface shall be explicit
         in the scope of that use.  The interface shall specify
         that the procedure is simple.

  C1599c All internal subprograms in a simple subprogram shall
         be simple.

  C1599d A simple subprogram shall not contain a designator of
         a variable that is host associated with a variable in
         the host of the subprogram or use associated with a
         module variable unless the designator is part of a
         specification inquiry (10.1.11).

  C1599e A simple subprogram shall not contain a reference to
         a variable in a common block.

  C1599f A specification inquiry in a simple subprogram that is
         not a constant expression shall not depend on a
         variable that is not a local entity of the subprogram
         or a construct entity or statement entity of a
         construct or statement contained in the subprogram.

  C1599g Any procedure referenced in a simple subprogram shall
         be simple."

  C1599h \obs{A simple subprogram shall not contain an ENTRY
         statement.}

  SS indicates that the procedure is a simple subroutine, and"
