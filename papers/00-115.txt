Subject: Issues 222 and 224

1. Introduction

In issue 222 Richard says that

   "The target of a pointer assignment is a data object or a procedure.  It
    may be specified directly, by a pointer, or be the result of a function
    reference that returns a pointer."

is confusing instead of helpful.  I concur.

There is no analogue of this paragraph in F95; it is merely explanatory
material.  Therefore we can delete it.  Furthermore, the text it was
attempting to explain is already reasonably short and lucid - at least it
is not obviously obfuscatory - so I believe it should stand on its own
with no further comment.

In issue 224 Richard suggests that our new "type-compatibility" constraint
makes a previous constraint redundant.  I concur.
