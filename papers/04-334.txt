Subject: VALUE attribute for passed-object dummy arguments

TITLE: VALUE attribute for passed-object dummy arguments
KEYWORDS: VALUE, passed-object, dummy argument
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
Consider the following program:

      module m
        type t
          integer*4 :: id
        contains
          procedure :: doThings => doThingsT
        end type
      contains
        subroutine doThingsT (a)
          class(t), value :: a
          a%id = 5
        end subroutine
      end module

      program p
        use m
        type(t) :: z = t(1)
        call z%doThings
        print *, z%id
      end program

Section 12.4.1.1 of Fortran 2003 states:
  In a reference to a type-bound procedure that has a passed-object
  dummy argument (4.5.3.3), the <data-ref> of the <function-reference>
  or <call-stmt> is associated, as an actual argument, with the
  passed-object dummy argument.

This seems to be contrary to the idea of the VALUE attribute.  For
argument association where the dummy argument has the VALUE attribute,
section 12.4.1.2 of Fortran 2003 states:
  If the dummy argument has the VALUE attribute it becomes associated
  with a definable anonymous data object whose initial value is that
  of the actual argument. Subsequent changes to the value or
  definition status of the dummy argument do not affect the actual
  argument.

It looks like the passed-object dummy argument is argument associated
with the object z itself, rather than an anonymous data object whose
initial value is that of z.

What value should the above program print?

ANSWER:
This program should print the value 1.  The inconsistency between
sections 12.4.1.1 and 12.4.1.2 should be fixed.  Edits are provided to
correct this oversight.

EDITS:
All edits refer to 04-007.
[268:17]  After "dummy argument (4.5.3.3)", insert "without the VALUE
          attribute".
[268:19+] Add the following paragraph:
            In a reference to a type-bound procedure that has a
            passed-object dummy argument (4.5.3.3) with the VALUE
            attribute, a definable anonymous data object whose initial
            value is that of the <data-ref> of the
            <function-reference> or <call-stmt> is associated, as an
            actual argument, with the passed-object dummy argument.
