DISCUSSION

Unresolved Technical Issue TR12 points out that paragraph 3 of 2.2
allows an assumed-rank object to be the first argument to an intrinsic
inquiry function and asks what happens if the rank is zero and when a
DIM argument is present.

The only functions involved are LBOUND, UBOUND, SIZE.

SIZE is covered in 3.4.2 - the DIM argument is ignored.

For LBOUND and UBOUND, the text in Fortran 2003 is clear: it requires
1 <= DIM <= n, where n is the rank. I think this is fine since there
is no suitable scalar value for the result. With DIM absent, we get a
zero-sized array, which is the correct result. An edit is supplied to
add a note.

EDIT to N1838:

[6:10+] After the subclause 3.4.3 UBOUND, add

NOTE 3.2
If LBOUND or UBOUND is invoked for an assumed-rank object that is
associated with a scalar and DIM is absent, the result is a zero-sized
array. LBOUND or UBOUND cannot be invoked for an assumed-rank object
that is associated with a scalar if DIM is present because the rank of
a scalar is zero and DIM must be >= 1.
