1. Introduction

Interp F03/0100 failed its WG5 ballot with one NO vote, with issues:

    1. The standard puts similar but somewhat different sentences in
       three places, which is inconsistent.  Only one sentence (in
       E editing) is complete while the other two (one for integer
       editing, and one for F editing) are both incomplete.

    2. As to the restriction on output being "NaN" for F editing when
       w == 0, I'm still not convinced it is to the best benefit to
       Fortran users given the fact that the majority of the
       processors today distinguish qNaNs vs. sNaNs.

Issue 1 does not seem to be complaining about the edits of this
interp, since it makes no change to E or integer editing.

Issue 2 definitely has nothing to do with this interp.  If change to
the output for NaN is required, it should be done as part of a future
revision, not an interp.  For example, it could be done as part of
ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 conformance.


2. The revised interp

NUMBER: F03/0100
TITLE: Error in field width for special cases of signed INFINITY
       output
KEYWORDS: formatted output, signed infinity
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is there an error in the description for the output of a IEEE infinity
with a sign and a field width of 3 or 8?

Fortran 2008, 10.7.2.3.2 paragraph 7, [252:33-34], describes the
output of IEEE infinities; this specifies asterisks (field overflow) if
the field width is less than 3, and omission of "inity" if the field
width is less than 8.  However, this does not take into account the
fact that there might be a plus or minus sign in the field.

The current text also fails to take into account the case of <w> = 0,
for both Infinity and NaN values.

ANSWER:

Yes, there is an error in the special cases.  Edits are provided to
correctly describe the required field widths for signed infinities.
An edit is also provided to repair the description of the output of
NaN values.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[252:33-34] 10.7.2.3.2p7, Replace "If <w> is ... produced." with

  "The minimum field width required for output of the form 'Inf' is 3
   if no sign is produced, and 4 otherwise.  If <w> is greater than
   zero but less than the minimum required, the field is filled with
   asterisks.  The minimum field width for output of the form
   'Infinity' is 8 if no sign is produced and 9 otherwise.  If <w> is
   zero or <w> is less than the minimum required but large enough to
   produce the form 'Inf', the form 'Inf' is output."

[252:37] Same subclause, p8, Replace "If <w> ... askerisks." with

  "If <w> is greater than zero and less than 3, the field is filled
   with asterisks.  If <w> is zero, the output field is 'NaN'.".
