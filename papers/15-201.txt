DISCUSSION:

The response to the DE6 comment was that [20:8-9] was put in to
enable an implementation to perform additional optimizations in
case the actual argument could be determined to be a coarray.

This paper suggests adding some text to NOTE 8.4 to describe the
motivation..

EDITS:

Add following new paragraph at the end of NOTE 8.4:
"If the actual argument is a coarray, the implementation might be
able to optimize the execution of the collective, for example
by avoiding copying of data."
