** /WG5 **

1. Opening of the Meeting: 8:00 am, May 4, 2009

2. Opening business
    2.1 Introductory remarks from the Convener
        John Reid welcomed everyone to the meeting.  Makki Takata
        will not be here - he was told not to come at the very
        last minute because of concerns about the widespread
        outbreak of swine flu.

        John reminded everyone that we will work right up until
        noon on Friday.

        The goal this week is to review the current draft of F2008
        09-007r1 to create the first committee draft.

    2.2 Welcome from the Host
        Van Snyder is the host.

    2.3 Local arrangements
        The hotel will provide water, soda, and coffee.  Van will
        provide snacks.

    2.4 Appointments for this meeting
        David Muxworthy graciously accepted the role of secretary.

        John Reid will act as WG5 librarian.

        The drafting committee is comprised of:
          David Muxworthy, head    (BSI)
          Reinhold Bader           (Germany)
          Van Snyder               (USA)
          Jim Xia                  (Canada)

    2.5 Adoption of the Agenda [N1767]
        The agenda was approved.

    2.6 Approval of the Minutes of the Tokyo 2008 Meeting [N1759]
        The minutes were approved.

3. Matters arising from the minutes
    The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA, may be interested
    in the paper version of old WG5 documents but is not interested in
    scanning the documents to make an electronic archive.

    John will ask Walt Brainerd about other historical Fortran
    artifacts.

4. Status of Tokyo 2008 Resolutions [N1758]
    The Interop TR is behind because of time being spent on finishing
    the F2008 draft.  Everyone agreed this was the correct trade-off.

      T5. WG5 Document Archive: See item 3 above.

      T7. Technical Content of Fortran 2008 CD
        That WG5 establishes that the technical content of the draft
        revised standard for Fortran which is scheduled to be submitted
        to SC22 for FCD ballot in 2009 shall be that in WG5-N1723 (also
        known as SC22 N4319 and 08-007r2) as modified by the edits
        specified in WG5-N1760.  The primary development body is
        encouraged to make editorial corrections and clarifications and
        to resolve inconsistencies, but the technical content should not
        be changed unless a serious flaw is found.

        Resolution T7 is the guiding principle for this meeting.
      T8. Schedule for Revision: This would be considered later in the
        meeting.
      T9. Interoperability Technical Report: The letter ballot had been
        held.  Production of a revised draft had been given low
        priority and the document was still being developed.

5. Reports
    5.1 SC22 Matters (Convener)
     "There had been no SC22 meeting since the last WG5 meeting.  It
      was known that there were errors in Technical Corrigendum 4 which
      was currently being balloted by SC22.  It had been established that
      minor changes could probably be made to the document without its
      undergoing a second SC22 ballot." [N1779]

    5.2 National Activity Reports (Heads of Delegations)
        Germany - Reinhold Bader had nothing to report

        in coarrays

    5.4 Reports from other Development Bodies (Editors/Heads)
        No other reports were given

    5.5 Liaison Reports:
          NCITS/PL22.11 (C): Craig Rasmussen

            interoperability.

          MPI: Craig Rasmussen
            work continues on a Fortran 2003 API {Craig heads this
            subcommittee} - they will need some of the features
            proposed in the Interop TR

          UPC:  Dan Nagle
            Group hasn't met recently but there will be a workshop
            that Dan hopes to attend where he can talk about coarrays

          IFIP/WG2.5: Van Snyder
            Group hasn't met recently

5.1 F2008 Plenary

   ** /WG5 **

   N1781-3 updates the strategic plan for WG5;  the following
   suggestions were made:

    * delay the Interop TR so the J3 review is Nov-09, WG5 review is
      Feb-10, and the other dates slide
    * this requires the WG5 meeting in 2010 is in February not June

   N1774-4 are the drfat meeting resolutions:

    * N1782 is the name of the new draft F2008 09-007r2
    * propose that WG5 meeting in 2011 be in Germany, 2012 in Canada,

   ** /WG5 **

   N1783 is the US position on the Corrigendum 4 ballot from 09-T13

   8. Construct a preliminary draft of the TR on further
      interoperability with C. 

   N1761 'TR 29113: "Further Interoperability of Fortran with C"'

    * Jim Xia says IBM wants the optional argument section and the
      prohibition on OPTIONAL + VALUE removed
    * OPTIONAL + VALUE now allowed in F2003 but OPTIONAL not a
    * Malcolm says that the de facto C convention for a missing
      argument is to NULL, ie, 0 by reference
    * SV: remove optional argument feature from Interop TR - leave
          optional argument feature as specified in Interop TR -
          undecided: 1-9-3 => the feature stays in the interop TR

   9. Consider the Fortran defect reports (interpretations) in J3-006.

      "Interpretations had been taken as part of the PL22.3 business
       during the meeting.  No specific actions had been required for
       WG5, other than that members had been made aware that there known
       errors (N1783) in Technical Corrigendum 4 (N1774 and N1775),
       because of incorrect edits in answers to interpretations, and
       that the Convenor was pursuing the matter with the SC22
       Secretariat.  The SC22 ballot was still open, hence member
       bodies could specify the errors and corrections in their votes.

   10. WG5 Business and Strategic Plans
   10.1 Goals for 2009-2012

       This item had been covered under discussion of the draft Strategic
       Plan earlier in the meeting.

   11. Closing Business
   11.1 Future meetings

       It had been decided (see above) that there would be annual summer
       meetings from 2011 onwards.  The tentative offer from Germany for
       2011 was accepted, that from Canada was revised to 2012 and one
       from the UK was provisionally accepted for 2013.

   11.2 Any other business

       None was raised." [N1779]

   12. Adoption of Resolutions (N1778)

   N1778-5a meeting resolutions:

    LV1.  Appreciation of Project Editor - unanimous acclaim
          That WG5 congratulates its Project Editor, Malcolm Cohen, for
          the high quality, speed and accuracy  of his work.

    LV2.  Appreciation of PL22.3 - unanimous acclaim
          That yet again WG5 congratulates the primary development body
          for its work on constructing the draft Fortran International
          Standard to the agreed schedule.

    LV3.  Revision of Technical Corrigendum 4 - unanimous consent
          That WG5 directs its Convenor to negotiate with the SC22
          Secretariat to allow revision of the document to correct the
          known minor errors, described in WG5-N1783, rather than for
          it to undergo a complete new balloting process.

    LV4.  Technical Content of Fortran 2008 FCD
          That WG5 recommends to its primary development body that the
          technical content of the draft revised standard for Fortran
          which is to be submitted for FCD ballot shall be that in
          WG5-N1782 (also known as J3/09-007r2).  The primary development
          body is encouraged to make editorial corrections and
          clarifications and to resolve inconsistencies, but the technical
          content should not be changed unless a serious flaw is found.

          Individual  vote: 9-0-4
          Country vote:     4-0-1
                              Yes:     Germany, Japan, UK, US
                              No:      none
                              Abstain: Canada

    LV5.  Strategic Plans for WG5
          That WG5 adopts the plans and schedules for its projects
          described in WG5-N1781.

          Individual  vote: 11-0-2
          Country vote:     5-0-0
                              Yes:     Canada, Germany, Japan, UK, US
                              No:      none
                              Abstain: none

    LV6.  Future Meetings - unanimous consent
          That WG5 proposes to meet in conjunction with PL22.3 in
          February 2010.  Further, WG5 thanks Reinhold Bader, Jim Xia
          and Jane Sleightholme for offering to investigate the
          possibility of holding summer WG5 meetings in Garching,
          Germany in 2011, Markham, Ontario, Canada in 2012 and London,
          UK in 2013 respectively.

    LV7.  Vote of Thanks for Support - unanimous acclaim
          That WG5 thanks PL22.3 for generously providing financial
          support for the meeting and for the social event.

    LV8.  Vote of Thanks - unanimous acclaim
          That WG5 expresses its appreciation to the convenor (John
          Reid), the secretary (David Muxworthy) and the drafting
          committee (Reinhold Bader, David Muxworthy, Van Snyder and
          Jim Xia) for their contributions to the success of the meeting.
          It wishes especially to thank the host (Van Snyder) for the
          excellent arrangements for both the business and social parts
          of the meeting.

      Following email discussions with Masayuki Takata throughout the
      meeting, Japan's proxy vote was cast in favour of all the
      resolutions.

   On behalf of WG5, John Reid thanked PL22.3 and Van Snyder for their
   hospitality.
