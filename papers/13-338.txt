Subject: Allow images to not join a team.

Discussion
----------

Cases could arise where it is desirable to have some images not
participate in the construction of a team via FORM SUBTEAM For
example, the teams might make sense only if there are a even number if
images in a team and the total number of images is odd.  Allow
subteamID=0 to represent an image not joining any team. The images not
joining a team synchronize among themselves and immediately leave the
construct. For subgroup discussion. An example would be useful.
