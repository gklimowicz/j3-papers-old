Discussion
----------

The changes proposed here are based on a suggestion in my ballot.
I think we need a clear definition of what is meant by a "known"
failed or stopped image. And if we add the concept of a stalled image,
as proposed in 14-250, I think we need a clear definition of what is
meant by a "known" stalled image.

Edits to N2027:
---------------

[5:32+] Add
"<3.4.1>
<known failed image>
image known by the executing image to have failed (5.8)"

[5:32+] Add
"<3.4.2>
<known stalled image>
image known by the executing image to have stalled (5.9)"
Note. This assumes that the concept of stalled image, see 14-250 is
accepted and subclause 5.9 has been added.

[14:7+] Add paragraph
"If the executing image detects that another image has failed by
executing an image control statement whose STAT= specifier is assigned
the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE or invoking a collective or atomic
subroutine whose STAT argument is set to STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, the other
image is known by the executing image to have failed."

[14:7+] Add to the end of the new paragraph "If the failure
has occurred as described in the previous paragraph, the image ceases
to be known as having failed after execution of the relevant END TEAM
statement."
Note. This assumes that the concept of stalled image, see 14-250 is
not accepted.

[14:7+] Add paragraph to end of 5.9:
"If the executing image detects that another image has stalled by
executing an image control statement whose STAT= specifier is assigned
the value STAT_STALLED_IMAGE or invoking a collective or atomic
subroutine whose STAT argument is set to STAT_STALLED_IMAGE, the other
image is known by the executing image to have stalled."
Note. This assumes that the concept of stalled image, see 14-250 is
accepted and subclause 5.9 has been added.

[25:31-35] Delete sentence "If the executing image ... failed."
Reason: Let's instead have a clear definition in 5.8.

[40:15+} Add
"{In 13.8.2.24 STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, insert new paragraph after
paragraph 1}
"If the executing image detects that another image has initiated normal
termination by executing a statement whose STAT= specifier is assigned
the value STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE or invoked a collective or atomic
subroutine whose STAT argument is set to STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, the other
image is known by the executing image to have initiated normal
termination."
