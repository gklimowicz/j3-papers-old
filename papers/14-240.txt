Subject: Interpretation concerning variable definition context
From: Van Snyder
Date: 2014 October 02
References: 10-007r1, 14-136r1

14-136r1 was submitted as a work item at meeting 204.  It was decided
that it ought to be processed as an interpretation.  14-136r1 addressed
only the case of a subobject of an associate name in a SELECT TYPE or
ASSOCIATE construct, but the problem is broader.

QUESTION:

Does this program conform to the Fortran 2008 standard?

  type :: T
    integer :: C
  end type T

  type(t), parameter :: V = T(41)
  character(len=*), parameter :: Z = ['first ', 'second']

  associate ( W => V )
1   w%c = 42
  end associate

2 v%c = 42

3 read * v%c

4 write ( z(1), '(i0)', iostat=v%c ) 42

  end

ANSWER:

According to 16.6.7p1(13),  A <variable> appears in a variable
definition context if it is (among other things), the <variable> in an
assignment statement, the <input-item> in a read statement, the
<internal-file-variable> in a <write-stmt>, or the <selector> in a
SELECT TYPE or ASSOCIATE construct and the associate name of that
construct appears in a variable definition context.

This does not include the case that if a subobject of the variable
appears in a variable definition context, the variable is considered to
have appeared in a variable definition context.

Therefore, V is not considered to have appeared in a variable definition
context in statements 1-4, Z is not considered to have appeared in a
variable definition context in statement 4, and the program conforms to
the Fortran 2008 standard.

V ought to have been considered to have appeared in a variable
definition context in statements 1-4, Z ought to have been considered to
have appeared in a variable definition context in statement 4, and the
program ought not to conform to the Fortran 2008 standard.

Edits are provided to remedy this oversight.

EDITS:

[457:13+ 16.6.7p1(13)+] Insert a list item:

"(13a) a subobject of the variable appears in a variable definition
       context;"

When it's integrated into the standard:

[somewhere in a subclause of 1.6 dealing with Fortran 2008 compatibility]

  "o The appearance of a subobject of a variable in a variable
     definition context now results in the variable being considered to
     have appeared in a variable definition context."
