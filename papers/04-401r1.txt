Subject:   Interpretation request on procedure pointers (F03/0012 revisited)
Reference: J3/04-358r2

NUMBER: F03/0012
TITLE:  Procedure pointers and the EXTERNAL attribute
KEYWORDS: Procedure pointers, EXTERNAL
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS:

QUESTION:

Is the following program unit standard conforming?

  SUBROUTINE SUB ( RPP )
    REAL, EXTERNAL, POINTER :: RPP
    EXTERNAL :: PP
    POINTER :: PP
    PROCEDURE(REAL), POINTER :: PPP => NULL()
  END SUBROUTINE SUB

The last sentence of "5.1.2.6 EXTERNAL attribute" appears to indicate that
it is allowed:

  "A procedure that has both the EXTERNAL and POINTER attributes is a
  procedure pointer."

That the title of subclause 12.2.1.2 is "Characteristics of dummy
procedures and dummy procedure pointers" suggests that it is allowed. 
That subclause continues "... whether it is a pointer, ..." so it was
clearly envisioned that at least dummy procedures could have the POINTER
attribute. 

C1216 [264:30] appears to require PPP to be allowed:

"C1216 (R1214) If => appears in <proc-decl>, the procedure entity shall
       have the pointer attribute."

On the other hand, A conspiracy of C512 [72:28-29]

"C512 (R501) If the POINTER attribute is specified, the ALLOCATABLE,
      TARGET, EXTERNAL, or INTRINSIC attribute shall not be specified."

the second sentence of subclause 5.1.2.6 [80:38-40]

  "This [EXTERNAL] attribute may also be specified by ... a
  <procedure-declaration-stmt>..."

the first paragraph of subclause 5.2 [85:15ff]

  "The combination of attributes that may be specified for a particular
  entity is subject to the same restrictions ... regardless of the method
  of specification.  This also applies to the PROCEDURE, EXTERNAL and
  INTRINSIC statements."

and the last sentence of the first paragraph of 12.3.2.3 [264:8]

  "It [the procedure declaration statement] specifies the EXTERNAL
  attribute...."

appears to completely wipe out procedure pointers (PPP because of the
first paragraph of 12.3.2.3).

C521 [73:6-7] and C568 [91:5] also appear to prohibit RPP and PP:

"C521 (R504) The <function-name> shall be the name of an external
      function, a function dummy procedure{, or a statement function}."

"C568 (R541) A <proc-entity-name> shall also be declared in a
      <procedure-declaration-stmt>."

But then the first paragraph after R1210 (defining the EXTERNAL statement)
[264:1] appears to allow RPP and PP:

  "Each <external-name> shall be the name of ... a procedure pointer...."

ANSWER:

The discussion of procedure pointers is indeed inconsistent.

The program unit is intended to be standard conforming.  It was an
oversight during the development of the procedure pointer facility that
the EXTERNAL attribute was not removed from C512, that "procedure
pointer" was not added to C521, and that an external statement and
specifying the EXTERNAL attribute in a type declaration statement were
not allowed in C568.  It is not helpful that the last sentence of the
first paragraph of subclause 5.2 refers to "PROCEDURE ... statements"
(which could be confused with the PROCEDURE statement in an interface
block) where it should refer to "procedure declaration ... statements."

EDITS:

Delete ", EXTERNAL" from C512.

Insert ", a procedure pointer" after "dummy procedure" in C521.

Replace the last sentence of the first paragraph of subclause 5.2 by
"This also applies to procedure declaration statements, and to EXTERNAL
and INTRINSIC statements."

Replace C568:

"C568 (R541) The EXTERNAL attribute (5.1.2.6) shall be explicitly
      specified for a <proc-entity-name>."

but whether this allows

  pointer :: BOHICA
  interface
    subroutine BOHICA
    end subroutine BOHICA
  end interface

may be fodder for yet another interp.
