NUMBER: F18/nnnn
TITLE: C837 contradicts normative text
KEYWORDS: Assumed rank
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Paragraph 1 of subclause 8.5.8.7 (Assumed-rank entity) states that an
assumed-rank entity is a dummy data object ... or the associate name of
a RANK DEFAULT block in a SELECT RANK construct.

C837 requires an assumed-rank entity to be a dummy data object.  It does
not permit the associate name of a RANK DEFAULT block in a SELECT RANK
construct.

Is the normative text in 8.5.8.7p1 correct, or is C837 correct?

ANSWER:

The normative text in 8.5.8.7p1 is correct.  C837 needs to be corrected.

Edits are included.

EDITS to 18-007r1:

[101:13-14 C837 in 8.5.8.7 Assumed-rank entity]

Replace C837 with the following:

C837 An assumed-rank entity shall be a dummy data object that does not
     have the CODIMENSION or VALUE attribute, or the associate name of a
     RANK DEFAULT block in a SELECT RANK construct in which the selector
     is such a data object.

{The curious wording at the end (hopefully) makes a recursion work in
the case of nested SELECT RANK.}
