Paper 12-180 from Casimir Katz requests that sequence types
be made extensible, and that Fortran derived types support
a union and map construct.  According to N1925, the Strategic plans
for WG5, and N1927, the Resolutions of the Markham 2012 meeting,
the only new features to be considered for the next revision
of the Fortran standard are very minor features.  This is in part
to allow vendors time to implement all of Fortran 2003 and
Fortran 2008.  It is also to allow the committees time to integrate two
technical specifications, numerous interpretation requests, and wording
improvements already committed for the next revision.

The experience of vendors present at J3 meeting 199 indicates
that implementing union and map features is difficult.  Doing so
in the presence of inheritance is estimated to be more difficult.

Also, the committee's limited resources are stretched rather thin
with existing work.  Therefore, we cannot pursue this proposed
work item at this time.  At this stage in the development cycle,
it is difficult to estimate when such a request could be undertaken.

We thank Casimir Katz for his interest in Fortran.
