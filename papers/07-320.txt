The current text of paragraph 2 in 9.5.6.1 OPEN/General grants
permission to have OPEN and other I/O statements in a BLOCK DATA
program unit. Probably not intended.

Edits to 07-007r3:

[217:12] At the beginning of paragraph 2 in 9.5.6.1 OPEN/General,
replace "An external unit" with "Except within a BLOCK DATA program
unit, an external unit".
