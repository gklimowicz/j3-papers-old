Subject:    Absurdity concerning namelist comment
Reference:  16-007
Date: 2016 February 09

1. Introduction
===============

10.10.2p3 says a slash is a value separator.

10.11.3.6p1 says 'a "!" character after a value separator ... initiates
a comment.'

10.11.3.2p3 says "A slash encountered as a value separator during the
execution of a namelist input statement causes termination of execution
of that input statement...."

10.11.3.2p4 says "A namelist comment may appear after any value
separator except a slash."

10.11.3.2p5 says "Successive namelist records are read by namelist input
until a slash is encountered; the remainder of the record is ignored and
need not follow the rules for namelist input values."

If a "!" appears after the slash that "causes termination of execution
of that input statement" is the remainder of the record ignored
(10.11.3.2p5), or does an error condition exist because a comment is not
permitted after the slash (10.11.3.2p4), or is it OK because the input
need not follow the rules for namelist input values (10.11.3.2p5)?

The contradiction appears to be somewhat (errrm... completely) absurd.

Hopefully, an interp is not needed to clear this up.

2. Edits
========

[274:27+ 10.11.3.2p3] Insert after paragraph 3:

"Successive namelist records are read by namelist input until a slash is
encountered; the remainder of the record is ignored."

{Moving the initial part of p5 to before p4}

[274:28 10.11.3.2p4] After "except a slash" add "(which terminates
namelist input)"

[274:30-31 10.11.3.2p5] Delete paragraph 5, part of which moved to
before paragraph 4.

The text now reads:

4 Successive namelist records are read by namelist input until a slash is
  encountered; the remainder of the record is ignored.

5 A namelist comment may appear after any value separator except a slash
  (which terminates namelist input). A namelist comment is also permitted
  to start in the first nonblank position of an input record except within
  a character literal constant.
