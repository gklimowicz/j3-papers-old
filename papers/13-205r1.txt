Subject: Varying String debris in f1x
Date: 2013 February 11

We have agreed to end support for Part 2 at about the same time
that f1x is to be published.  Therefore, the disposition
of VS could appropriately be incorporated into f1x.

A copy of part 2 is in the Tutorials.

The prime candidates for inclusion in f1x are the intrinsics
specified by part 2 but not in part 1.  These include some
input/output procedures and some string manipulation procedures.

The i/o procedures are GET, PUT and PUT_LINE.

The other intrinsics are EXTRACT, INSERT, REMOVE, REPLACE,
and SPLIT.

Plenary straw votes for each procedure should be conducted,
and the next revision of this paper will include those
gaining an endorsement.

Straw votes:

Intrinsic X should be included in f1x:  Yes / No / Undecided
(X is each procedure above in turn)

Is there any other functionality in part 2 that should be in part 1 ?
