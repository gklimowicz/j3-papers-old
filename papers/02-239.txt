Subject:  Minor edits

This paper will attempt to correct (or at least point out) a few typos,
formatting errors, and other minor inaccuracies in 02-007r2.

Edits:

[73:16+]  In note 5.5, "-9999" has an extra "-".  I assume this
          is due to an incorrect TeXism.
          Change: "--9999" => "-9999".

[194:10+] In note 9.34, there is a formatting problem.  The
          comment "! Allowed if no two elements"  is split up
          onto two lines.

          The following three edits are to correct something that
          went wrong between 02-007 and 02-007r1.  I assume that
          it was an attempt to correct the references in 02-007
          to list items "(2)(2a)" and "(2)(2b)", but somehow
          list item (2) itself got merged with list item (1).

[205:14]  This should be the start of list item (2).
          Add "(2)" to this line similar to "(1)" at [205:8]
          (using whatever necessary TeXism).

[205:17]  Change "(1a)" => "(2a)".  This was the original meaning
          according to 02-007.

[205:21]  Change "(1a)" => "(2a)" and "(1b)" => "(2b)".  Again,
          this was the original meaning in 02-007.

[523]     Formatting problem: The headings "Annex E" and
          "(Informative)" run together vertically.  I don't know
          the necessary TeXisms to fix this, so I'll leave it to
          the editor.

[524]     The index entry for the ASSOCIATE construct is
          misspelled.
          Change: "ASOCIATE construct" => "ASSOCIATE construct"
