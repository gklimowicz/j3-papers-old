Subject: Spurious defined terms in clause 15.
Date: 2009 February 05

1. Introduction
---------------

The system for "defining" terms we used in previous versions of the
standard is not in accordance with the ISO guidelines, so we need to stop
using it.  We have already introduced the ISO-compliant defined terms
subclause, and moved/copied many definitions into it.  However, quite a lot
have not been revised.  These should either
  - be turned into normal text ("untermified")
or
  - become proper defined terms.

This paper deals with the terms in clause 15.


2. Terms and what to do with them
---------------------------------

 - C character kind: It's Just A Kind, Definition Is Wrong;
   = untermify, index as definition;

 - interoperates: Special Term, Not Used Much, Only In Clauses 15 & 16;
   = untermify, index as definition (this is a close call).

 - interoperable (5 definitions): Special Term;
   = termify, index all of 15.3 as definition of "interoperable".


3. Edits to 09-007
------------------

[] Define term
  "\term{interoperable}
   of a Fortran entity, being equivalent to an entity defined by or
   definable by the \termi{companion processor}
   (\ref{D13:Interoperability between Fortran and C entities})".
{I deliberately left 15.4 and 15.5 out of here, because although they are
 talking about interoperation it is already in the context of having
 interoperable thingos to talk about.}

[throughout] Hyperlink "interoperable" as appropriate.

[434:2(15.2.2p5)] Replace last sentence "The ... <<kind>>." with
  "If the value of C_CHAR is non-negative, the character kind specified
   is the C character kind; otherwise, there is no C character kind."
{It's the kind that's the kind, not the value of the kind type parameter.
 And we ought not to claim that -1 is a valid "kind".}

[437:16(15.3.1p1)] "<<interoperates>>"->"would interoperate",
                   and index as definition of "interoperate".
{Conditional clause means use subjunctive.}

[437:13(15.3)] Index from here to the end of 15.3 as the definition
               of "interoperable".

[437:28(15.3.2p3)] Unembolden "interoperable", do not index.

[439:6(15.3.4p1)] Unembolden "interoperable", do not index.

[440:3(15.3.5p1)] Unembolden "interoperable", do not index.

[440:8(15.3.6p1)] Unembolden "interoperable", do not index.

[441:5(15.3.7p1)] Unembolden "interoperable", do not index.
