Subject: Pointer function references as actual arguments
From: Malcolm Cohen
Date: 2005/08/10

References: WG5/N1626-UK-007

1. Basic Functionality

Allow references to functions returning an associated pointer to
appear as actual arguments associated with INTENT(OUT) dummies. This
is parallel to the way pointer variables are treated.

2. Detailed specification

When a pointer is passed to a nonpointer dummy argument, the dummy
argument becomes associated to the target of the pointer, not the
actual argument itself.  Some of the restrictions on dummy arguments,
in particular those on definability, should apply to this associated
entity rather than the actual argument.

The terminology and its use in chapter 12 should also be clarified so
that this distinction can be more easily understood.

3.  Syntax

There is no new syntax.

4.  Edits to 04-007

[81:35] In the fourth paragraph after C546 -- the one that begins "If
no INTENT..." -- replace "associated actual argument" by "argument
associated entity".

[268:1-15] In the first paragraph of 12.4.1, use "correspond" in the
appropriate form instead of "associate".  In detail:

Replace "is associated with" by "corresponds to" at [268:5], [268:7-8],
[268:9], and [268:10].

Replace "be associated with" by "correspond to" at [268:13], [268:14],
and [268:15].

Then add a new paragraph:

"Except in references to intrinsic inquiry functions, if the dummy
argument is not a pointer and the corresponding actual argument is a
pointer, the actual argument shall be pointer associated with a target
and the dummy argument becomes argument associated with that target.
Otherwise the dummy argument becomes argument associated with the
corresponding actual argument.

[269:20-22] Delete the paragraph that begins "Except in references to
intrinsic inquiry functions...."

[270:38-39] In the paragraph that begins "If a nonpointer dummy argument
has INTENT(OUT)..." replace "actual argument" by "argument associated
entity" and replace "corresponding actual argument by "argument
associated entity".

[418:16-17] Replace the first sentence of the second paragraph of
16.4.5 Establishing associations -- the one that begins "For argument
association..." -- by "For argument association, if the dummy argument
is not a pointer and the corresponding actual argument is a pointer,
the pre-existing entity is the target of that pointer.  Otherwise the
pre-existing entity is the corresponding actual argument.  In either
case, the associating entity is the dummy argument."
