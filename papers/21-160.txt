OpenACC Liaison Report
======================
 
Information about OpenACC, including the current standard document,
training materials, and upcoming events can be found at
http://www.openacc.org/.
 
The current OpenACC standard is version 3.1. Version 3.1 of the OpenACC
specification was adopted November 2020.  The specification can be found
at https://www.openacc.org/specification. A notable feature of this
release is a definition for interactions with DO CONCURRENT when used
within OpenACC compute regions.
  
News
-----
A new open source OpenACC Compiler was announced in March 2021. The 
compiler, called  Clacc, provides OpenACC support for Clang and the
LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project. More information on this
compiler is available at the OpenACC website, 
https://www.openacc.org/. 

Applications
-------------
There are over 250 applications in production or development using
OpenACC, including:
	- Code LEO (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
	- NekCEM (Computational Electromagnetics)
	- INCOMP3d (3D incompressible Navier-Stokes solver)
	- Cloverleaf
	- MAESTRO and CASTRO (modeling stellar explosions)
	- LSDalton (quantum chemistry)
	- SPECFEM-X (Geophysics)
	- GTS (Fusion)
And the usual suspects:
	- Gaussian 16
	- ANSYS Fluent
	- VASP 6
	- MPAS-A
	- COSMO
	- GAMERA for GPU
	- Quantum Espresso
 
More information on these can be found on the OpenACC
web site at https://www.openacc.org/success-stories.

Hackathons
----------
Since our last report (https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/21/21-118.txt),
there have been 8 OpenACC hack-a-thons. There is 1 upcoming hack-a-thon
at the end of July. Event dates are posted at 
https://www.gpuhackathons.org/events. It is not a requirement to use 
OpenACC directives to participate in these hackathons.

Community Engagement
--------------------
The OpenACC community slack is open to anyone interested and currently 
supports a community of nearly 2700 members. The most recent users group 
meeting, held virtually, had more than 300 attend live.
