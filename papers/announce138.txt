      Adjournment

A note on subgroups and WG5 resolution processing:  I am assuming that the
Chair will set up subgroups on Monday morning to process the WG5 resolutions.
All topics listed in the agenda under "Subgroup reports" are intended to be
reports on the progress of the WG5 resolution responses.
