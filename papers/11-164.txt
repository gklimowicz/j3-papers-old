Subject: Interop TR: minor lifetime problems
Date: 2011 June 07
Reference: N1854


When looking at the constraints, I noticed a few minor problems with the
lifetime wording.

One is that we need to say that an allocatable descriptor created by C
must be unallocated before its lifetime ends, if that occurs before the
program exits.

The other is that the first sentence in 20:9-12 needs restricting to
BIND(C) interfaces (or Fortran - it does not matter, here) to avoid
forbidding the use of some of the functions in this TR!


Edits to N1854:

[20:9] After "actual argument" append "to a BIND(C) interface".

[20:12+] Add a new paragraph:

    "If the lifetime of a C descriptor that was established by C and
which has the value CFI_allocatable in member attribute ends before the
program exits, the descriptor shall be unallocated at that time."
