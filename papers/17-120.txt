Subject: END PROGRAM exit status inconsistency
Date: 2017 February 07


1. Introduction

The processor exit status resulting from executing END PROGRAM is stated
twice (in the same paragraph), inconsistently.


2. Discussion

According to 11.4 STOP and ERROR STOP statements, paragraph 2, sentence 3,
[207:3-5]
  "If ... an end-program-stmt is executed, it is recommended that the
   value zero be supplied as the process exit status".

However, sentence 4 of the same subclause says,
[207:5-7]
  "If ... an end-program-stmt is executed, it is recommended that a
   processor-dependent nonzero value be supplied as the process exit
   status".

Since executing an END PROGRAM statement must be a very normal termination
method, if not the most normal termination possible, the prior sentence
would appear to be correct, and the second sentence would seem to be a
mistake.  (This mistake was already present in paper 15-137r1, unnoticed.)


3. Edits to 17-007

[207:6] 11.4 STOP and ERROR STOP statements, p2,
  After "If the stop-code in an ERROR STOP statement is of type character
         or does not appear,"
  Delete "or if an end-program-stmt is executed,".
