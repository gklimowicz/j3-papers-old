Subject: UK proposal UK-13 Formatted I/O error conditions
Date: 2014 June 25


Status: For Consideration
Basic Functionality:  Standardize certain I/O error conditions

Comment:
This proposal refers only to numeric or logical input errors.
It could be extended to other I/O errors.

Rationale:
Standardize certain I/O error conditions so as to allow a
standard-conforming program to regain control after an error.

Specification:
If during formatted input a character input for numeric or
logical editing is not acceptable to the processor, an error
condition occurs.

Syntax:
No syntax change.

Edits to J3/14-007r1(= N2014):

[xviii] Introduction: Add to the bullet "Input/output" the sentence
"An error condition occurs if unacceptable characters are presented
for logical or numeric editing during execution of a formatted input
statement."

[197:30+] Add a new paragraph 2 to 9.2.2 "Formatted record" as follows:
"If during execution of a formatted input statement, an input field
presented for logical or numerical editing contains a character that
is not acceptable to the processor, an error condition occurs."

[240:29] In 9.11.1 General, replace "The" by "Except as identified
in subclause 9.2.2, the".
