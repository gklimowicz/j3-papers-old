From:    David Muxworthy
Subject: UK proposal UK-18 Consistency of intrinsic arguments
Date: 2014 June 09

Status: For Consideration
Basic Functionality: Improve consistency of intrinsic arguments

Rationale:
There is inconsistency amongst arguments to intrinsic functions,
especially LOGICAL ones, in that some are required to be of default
kind and some are not.  When KINDs were first introduced the policy
was to allow any kind for input arguments, and default kind for output
arguments.  Consistency has been lost and should be restored.  The BSI
panel endorses Stan Whitlock's paper on this subject.

Specification:
Improve consistency of intrinsic arguments.

Syntax:
Extend the kinds for arguments in certain intrinsic and intrinsic module
procedures to allow any kinds, not just default kinds.

Edits to J3/14-007r1(= N2014):
The edits are in paper J3/14-168.
