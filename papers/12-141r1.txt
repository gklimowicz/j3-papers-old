Subject: Requirements for needing an explicit interface

NUMBER: F08/0054
TITLE: Requirements for needing an explicit interface
KEYWORDS: Explicit interface
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the program

  SUBROUTINE Fred() BIND(C,NAME='Nurke')
    PRINT *,'ok'
  END SUBROUTINE
  SUBROUTINE S(dummy)
    INTERFACE
      SUBROUTINE dummy() BIND(C)
      END SUBROUTINE
    END INTERFACE
    CALL dummy
  END SUBROUTINE
  PROGRAM example1
    EXTERNAL Fred,S
    CALL S(Fred)
  END PROGRAM

According to 12.4.2.2, an explicit interface is only ever required in
a scope where a procedure is referenced.  The main program does not
reference Fred, so this appears to be conforming.  It appears that
no processors accept this example...

However, the very similar program minus the BIND(C) specifications

  SUBROUTINE Freddy(x)
    LOGICAL,OPTIONAL :: x
    IF (PRESENT(x)) PRINT *,'ok'
  END SUBROUTINE
  SUBROUTINE SUB(dummy)
    INTERFACE
      SUBROUTINE dummy(x)
        LOGICAL,OPTIONAL :: x
      END SUBROUTINE
    END INTERFACE
    CALL dummy(.TRUE.)
  END SUBROUTINE
  PROGRAM example2
    EXTERNAL Freddy,SUB
    CALL SUB(Freddy)
  END PROGRAM

but with a different reason for requiring an explicit interface, is
also apparently valid in Fortran 2003/2008 but is not valid in
Fortran 90 or Fortran 95, because they require the explicit interface
without the condition of the procedure being referenced in that
scope.

This feature (viz only require the explicit interface where it is
referenced) was added by paper 02-144, which makes no mention of it
being a new feature.

Was this a deliberate new feature?

ANSWER:

No, this was a mistake in 02-144 and thus in Fortran 2003 and 2008.
An edit is provided to correct the mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1 (after corrigendum 1):

[24:11+] 1.6.2 Compatibility, at the end, insert new paragraph

   "Fortran 2003 only required an explicit interface for a procedure
    that was actually referenced in the scope, not merely passed as an
    actual argument.  This part of ISO/IEC 1539 requires an explicit
    interface for a procedure under the conditions listed in 12.4.2.2,
    regardless of whether the procedure is referenced in the scope."

[279:19] In 12.4.2.2p1, replace
   "A procedure ... and"
with
   "Within the scope of a procedure identifier, the procedure shall
    have an explicit interface if \obs{it is not a statement function
    and}"
