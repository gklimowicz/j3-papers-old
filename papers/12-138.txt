NUMBER: F08/0004
TITLE: Is TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED a pointer or nonpointer dummy?
KEYWORDS: TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following conforming, and if so what does it print?

  program TARGET_Arg
    integer, pointer :: Pointer
    integer, pointer :: Target => NULL()
    integer, target :: AnotherTarget
    pointer => anotherTarget
    print *, Associated(pointer,target)
  end program TARGET_Arg

DISCUSSION:

Subclause 13.7 stipulates that descriptions of arguments of intrinsic
procedures apply to actual arguments.  This leaves open the question
whether the TARGET dummy argument of ASSOCIATED is a pointer or not.

If not a pointer, being optional, it is considered by subclause
12.5.2.12 to be absent if the corresponding actual argument is
disassociated.

Thereby, the result value of ASSOCIATED (by Case(i) of the result
value clause) is true.

If the TARGET dummy argument is a pointer, the result value of
ASSOCIATED (by Case (iv) of the result value clause) is false.

ANSWER:

The Result Value paragraph of 13.7.16 ASSOCIATED only makes sense if
the references to TARGET are talking about the actual argument.
Therefore the program is standard conforming and prints F.

An edit is supplied to remind the reader.

NOTE: This subsumes interp F08/0005 (10-152).

[330:36+] Insert new Note

  "NOTE 13.8a
   The references to TARGET in the above cases are referring to
   properties that might be possessed by the actual argument, so the
   case of TARGET being a disassociated pointer will be covered by
   case (iii), (vi), or (vii).".
