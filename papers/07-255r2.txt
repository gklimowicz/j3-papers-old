Discussion

NOTE 8.33 says that there may be a need for a SYNC ALL statement
before the first executable statement of the main program. The editor
takes the view that this is not necessary since the standard says that
an initialized variable is initially defined (that is, before its own
image or any other image accesses it). However, the text in 2.4.5 is
currently unclear regarding the beginning of execution. An edit is
provided to clarify the sequence of actions.


Edits to 07-007r2:

[27:9] In 2.4.5 Execution sequence, replace the first sentence with
"Following the creation of a fixed number of instances of the program,
execution begins on each image."

[213:18+] In 8.5.2 SYNC ALL statement, delete NOTE 8.33.
