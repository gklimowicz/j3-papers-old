Discussion
----------

In his recent ballot (see N2045) Reinhold Bader suggested some changes
in clause 8.7. The reasons are given with each edit.

Edits to N2040:
---------------

[37:14] Before "FORM TEAM", insert "\uwave{EVENT POST, EVENT WAIT,}".
Reason: Similar to locks, events only impose one-way segment ordering,
and this ordering is already defined in [18:21-24], so a SYNC MEMORY
appears unnecessary. See 09-193r2 for the reasoning for LOCK/UNLOCK.


[37:18+] Add a new edit
"{In 8.5.2 Segments, edit the first sentence of NOTE 8.34 as follows}
The model upon which the interpretation of a program is based is that
there is a permanent memory location for each coarray and that all
images \uwave{on which it is established} can access it."
Reason: The addition of teams renders the old wording incorrect.

[38:13] Delete "on all images"
Reason: For each statement it is clear on which images it is
executed; this may be a subset of all images.
