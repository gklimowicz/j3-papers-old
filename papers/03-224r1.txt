This paper is a revision of WG5/N1568, which in turn was a revision
of N1546.

47:10, 48:0+3, and 53:0+2. Change 'LENGTH' to 'LEN' (3 times)

285:7. Change 'may' to 'shall'.

285:9. Change 'may' to 'shall'.

408:17+2. After 'inaccessible' add 'by its own name'.

255:8. Change 'may' to 'shall'.

255:11. Change 'may' to 'shall'. [A more substantial rewording is desirable.]

260:39. Change 'may' to 'shall' and 'was' to 'is'

269:20. Change 'may' to 'shall not' and 'only if ... =' to 'unless it'.

285:13. Change 'may' to 'shall not', delete 'only', and change 'subroutine'
        to 'function'.

287:25. Change 'may appear only' to 'shall not appear more than'.


28:6 Removed an attempt to index the "!" on this line.  It never
     worked anyway, but I just now noticed.  Could be put back in if
     I figure out how to make it work.  Since it wasn't working,
     this edit doesn't actually change the document; just avoids an
     error message in one of the log files.

50:11  Manually added a "soft" hyphen to avoid the overrun
       into the right margin.  (Also required a minor Makefile
       change to accomodate soft hyphens in indexed terms).

181:32 Removed extra blank before <<connected>>.

267:22+5  Add "Note" before "7.43".  This was an eror in
       entering edits from 03-173.
