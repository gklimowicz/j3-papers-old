Subject: UTI 112 (p211): Image control statement problems with OPEN

Discussion

1. An edit was made at the previous meeting to require that an OPEN
   for a file that is connected with a team of more than one image
   should specify the same image team. It is our view that if the OPEN
   would cause a change in the connect team, the user should close the
   connection for the old team and then open it for the new team. This
   makes a clear statement to the reader that the change of team was
   intended.

2. Since an OPEN or CLOSE statement for a file on only one image does
   not rely on execution ordering between images, it is reasonable
   that such a statement not be an image control statement.  Edits for
   provided for this change.

3. We think users would be surprised and annoyed to find that OPENs
   and CLOSEs without TEAM= were prohibited in a critical
   construct. The sequence of OPEN, data transfer, and CLOSE within a
   critical construct is an important mechanism for managing access to
   a shared file.
