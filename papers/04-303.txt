TITLE: End-of-record and PAD
KEYWORDS: End-of-record, PAD
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Subclause 9.4.3 specifies:

  If an end-of-record condition occurs during execution of a
  nonadvancing input statement, the following occurs: if the PAD=
  specifier has the value YES, the record is padded with blanks
  (9.4.4.4.2) to satisfy the input list item and corresponding data
  edit descriptor that require more characters than the record
  contains;

There appears to be a problem if a list item does not correspond to
exactly one edit descriptor.

QUESTION:

If an End-of-record condition occurs during execution of a
nonadvancing input statement and the PAD= specifier has the value YES

  (1) do enough blanks get supplied for the next data edit descriptor
      and whatever part of the list item corresponds to that edit
      descriptor, or
  (2) do enough blanks get supplied for the remainder of the list item
      and as many edit descriptors as necessary, or
  (3) do enough blanks get supplied to process the rest of the input
      list?

ANSWER:

The situation can only arise for list items of complex type, because list
items of derived type are processed as if their components had appeared as
list items -- see [149:8-10].  It is clear from text at [150:15] and
[153:13] that blanks are not supplied for more than one list item.  So the
answer to part (3) of the question is "no".  Since the texts at [150:15]
and [153:13] also refer to a single format item, this leaves the answer
to parts (1) and (2) of the question ambiguous: Is it one list item, or
one edit descriptor?

The answer is that enough blanks are supplied by the processor to satisfy
all of the edit descriptors for a list item.

EDITS:

97-007r2

[150:15] and [153:13-14]: Replace "corresponding data edit descriptor" by
"its corresponding data edit descriptors" twice.

03-007r2:

Fortran 2003 introduced the concept of an "effective list item," which
should be exploited to clarify this question.

[198:12] Replace "input item and its corresponding data edit descriptor"
by "effective input item and its corresponding data edit descriptors".

[218:6-7] Replace "input list item (9.5.3.4.2) and corresponding data
edit descriptor that requires" by "effective input item (9.5.2) and its
corresponding data edit descriptors that require".
