Subject: (j3.2000-558) different-rank views of array objects 


Dear members of Fortran J3,


I have read the proposal described by Van Snyder in the note 
ftp://ftp.j3-fortran.org/j3/doc/meeting/154/00-255.ps.gz
and I feel that it could be a very useful extension to the current
Fortran standard.


I know that this proposal has already been rejected. However, I'd
like J3 to reconsider it, or any other similar mechanism that would
allow to view arrays of a given rank as if they were of a different
rank, without any duplication of the data.


Best Regards,
