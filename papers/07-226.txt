Introduction
------------

C449 at [65:25-27] and C453 at [66:1-3] are far too restrictive.
Actually, C449 is irrelevant unless C530 is repaired.

Edits
-----

[65:25-27] Editor: Replace C449:

"C449  (R444)  Each bound in the <explicit-shape-spec> shall be a
        specification expression in which there are no references to
        specification functions or the intrinsic functions ALLOCATED,
        ASSOCIATED, EXTENDS_TYPE_OF, PRESENT, or SAME_TYPE_AS, every
        specification inquiry reference is an initialization expression,
        and the value does not depend upon the value of a variable."

Delete UTI note 094 if this paper repairs the problem.

[66:1-3] Editor: Replace C453:

"C453 (R440) Each <type-param-value> within a <component-def-stmt> shall
      be a colon or a specification expression in which there are no
      references to specification functions or the intrinsic functions
      ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED, EXTENDS_TYPE_OF, PRESENT, or SAME_TYPE_AS,
      every specification inquiry reference is an initialization
      expression, and the value does not depend upon the value of a
      variable."

[94:12]

Repair C530 to allow using nonconstant specification expressions in
component declarations.

Editor: Insert ", a derived type definition" before "or".

[155:15-17] Allow nonconstant specification expressions in derived type
definitions.  Editor: Insert "a derived type definition" after
"construct".  Better yet, in light of the revised C530, delete "A
<specification-expr> ... (12.6.2.2)."
