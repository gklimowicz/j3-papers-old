Subject: constraints on entities of type LOCK_TYPE

NUMBER: F08/0045
TITLE:  constraints on entities of type LOCK_TYPE
KEYWORDS: lock, polymorphism
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

  Program example
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env, Only:lock_type
    type :: m
      class(*), allocatable :: lock
    end type
    type(m) :: om[*]
    allocate(lock_type :: om%lock)
    call inner(om)                  ! Problem call.
  Contains
    Subroutine inner(omm)
      Type(m),Intent(Out) :: omm
      Print *,Allocated(omm%lock)
    End Subroutine
  End Program

Constraint C1304 attempts to prohibit a variable with a LOCK_TYPE
subobject from appearing in a variable definition context, such as the
call to inner, but the dynamic type of om%lock cannot be determined
statically.

Is this program standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The example was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An ALLOCATE
statement with a <type-spec> should not have been permitted to add
components of type LOCK_TYPE; an edit is supplied to correct this
error.

EDITS to 10-007:

[127;7] In C641,
  After "C_PTR" replace "or" by ",";
  After "C_FUNPTR" insert
    ", LOCK_TYPE (13.8.2.16), or a type with a direct component of
     type LOCK_TYPE that is not a direct component of the declared
     type of any <allocate-object>,".
{Fix condition to prohibit LOCK_TYPE and any type with a LOCK_TYPE
 direct component.  Note that we only want to prohibit "new" lock_type
 components from appearing in the <type-spec>, we don't want to forbid
 ones that are already in the declared type.}

[127:8] After "LOCK_TYPE" delete "(13.8.2.16)".
{Reference now appears one line earlier, so is unnecessary.}
