From:    Mike Ross

1. Introduction

The terms "data entity" and "data object" or "object" are used so
widely through the document that changing them would result in thousands
of edits, which we're unlikely to get correct. Data object seems to be properly
defined as a subset of data entity, and seems to be fairly consistently
used through the document where the defined subset is required. However,
one or two small inconsistencies were discovered in going through the document
for this issue, and miscellaneous edits are offered for these. The first
is just imprecise language in the definition of a polymorphic entity.
The second is an inconsistency - a procedure pointer may be a function
result, and a function result is a data entity. The existing text speaks
of a procedure pointer as if it is a different case than a data entity.
The edit fixes the inconsistency.  The overall resolution for issue
266 seems to be "delete editor's whining."
