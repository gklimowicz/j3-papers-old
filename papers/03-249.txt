Subj:  More NaN edits


As a compromise between following WG5's direction, and improved
interoperability with C, J3 has decided to allow 'Nan()' in an
input field, but not allow a processor to produce 'Nan()' in an
output field for a NaN value.

Similarly, J3 has decided to allow an optional sign for
NaN IEEE exceptional specifications in input fields, but not allow
a processor to produce a sign in an output field for a NaN
value.


EDITS: In 03-007, make the following changes:

[230:19] Before "the string" add "an optional sign, followed by"

[230:25] Append "The interpretation of a sign in a NaN input field
                 is processor dependent." to the end of that paragraph.

[230:31] Change "up" to "one".

end of edits
