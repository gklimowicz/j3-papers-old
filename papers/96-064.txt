There is another aspect of user control over pointer bounds that has to
do with the direction of the stride.  Note that the stride is always 1
(in magnitude) regardless of the distance between array elements.

This can best be explained by some examples:

    integer, target :: t(0:10) = (/ (i, i=0,10) /)
    integer, pointer :: p(:)

			    lbound  ubound        values
                            ------  ------        ------
1. now p      => t(0:5)        1      6         0 1 2 3 4 5
2. new p(0:)  => t(0:5)        0      5         0 1 2 3 4 5
3. now p      => t(0:10:2)     1      6         0 2 4 6 8 10
4. new p(0:)  => t(0:10:2)     0      5         0 2 4 6 8 10
5. now p      => t(10:5:-1)    1      6        10 9 8 7 6 5
6. new p(10:) => t(10:5:-1)   10     15        10 9 8 7 6 5
7. now p      => t(10:0:-2)    1      6        10 8 6 4 2 0
8. new p(10:) => t(10:0:-2)   10     15        10 8 6 4 2 0

Perhaps what was really wanted in 6. and 8. was an lbound of 10 and a
ubound of 5, but this is not possible unless a further addition is made
to the language.

Possible syntax including a stride direction:

6. new p(10::-1) => t(10:5:-1)  10    5        10 9 8 7 6 5

but this seems somewhat inappropriate for 8., so another alternative
could be:

8. new p(10(-):) => t(10:0:-2)  10    5        10 8 6 4 2 0

If there is concern about consistency between pointer association and
argument association, this functionality could be applied to argument
association as well.  It is not currently provided although control over
bounds is.

Straw Vote: Should pointer association provide a mechanism for users to
	    control the direction of stride.

If so,

Straw Vote: Should this mechanism be extended to argument association?
