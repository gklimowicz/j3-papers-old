Discussion
----------

In the changes imported from Corrigendum 2, there are five places (see
edits below) where what was "ultimate component" in coarray contexts
in Fortran 2018 needs to be "potential subobject component" in Fortran
2023.


Edits to the DIS
----------------

In 15.5.2.14 Restrictions on entities associated with dummy arguments,
para 1, item (3) (e), change "ultimate component" to "potential subobject
component" so that the item becomes
"Action that affects the value of the entity or any subobject of it shall
be taken only through the dummy argument unless ..., or the dummy
argument has a coarray potential subobject component and the action is a
coindexed definition of the corresponding coarray by a different image."

In 15.5.2.14 Restrictions on entities associated with dummy arguments,
para 1, item (4) (e), change "ultimate component" to "potential subobject
component" so that the item becomes
"If the value of the entity or any subobject of it is affected through
the dummy argument, then at any time during the invocation and execution
of the procedure, either before or after the definition, it shall be
referenced only through that dummy argument unless ..., or
the dummy argument has a coarray potential subobject component and the
reference is a coindexed reference of the corresponding coarray by a
different image."

In 15.5.2.14 Restrictions on entities associated with dummy arguments,
final note (NOTE 5), first sentence, change "ultimate component" to
"potential subobject component" so that the sentence becomes
"The exceptions to the aliasing restrictions for dummy arguments that
are coarrays or have coarray potential subobject components enable
cross-image access while the procedure is executing."

In 16.9.54 CO_BROADCAST, argument A,  final sentence change "ultimate
component" to "potential subobject component" twice so that the sentence
becomes
"If no error condition occurs, A becomes defined, as if by intrinsic
assignment, on all images in the current team with the value of A on
image SOURCE_IMAGE, including (re)allocation of any allocatable potential
subobject component, and setting the dynamic type of any polymorphic
allocatable potential subobject component."
