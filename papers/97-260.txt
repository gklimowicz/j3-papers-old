Subject:  Per Operation Rounding Modes


Per operation rounding is one of the six features suggested in order
to support intervals as a user-defined type.

This feature is also useful in and of itself.

Some hardware exists that supports changing the rounding mode on an
instruction by instruction basis. Other hardware is unable to switch
rounding modes quickly. Both kinds of system can possibly generate
more efficient code with this source construct.

There are many possibilities for the form of such operators. Some of
these are illustrated below. The illustrations show encodings of the
Fortran expression:

     (Sqrt(b**2-4*a*c)+b)/(2*a)


1.  ( sqrt_up ( b .**up. 2 .-down. 4 .*up. a .*up. c )

    .+down. b ) ./up. ( 2 .*down. a )

2. ( sqrt_up ( b .**^. 2 .- . 4 .*^. a .*^. c ) .+ . b )

    ./^. ( 2 .* . a )


3. ( sqrt_up ( b **^ 2 -  4 *^ a *^ c ) +  b ) /^ ( 2 *  a )


4. ( sqrt_up ( b **/ 2 -\ 4 */ a */ c ) +\ b ) // ( 2 *\ a )


5.  divide_up (sqrt_up (minus_down (power_up(b, 2),
    multiply_up(4, a, c))), multiply_down(2, a))
