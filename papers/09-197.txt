There is no need for a LOCK statement to be an image control statement
if it is not successful.

An edit is provided to correct this.


Edit to 09-007r1

[189:24] In 8.5.1, para 2, change the fifth bullet to

  o LOCK statement that causes its <lock-variable> to become locked
    (8.5.6);

  o UNLOCK statement;
