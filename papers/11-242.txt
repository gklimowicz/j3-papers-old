Subject: Convert TR 29113 to TS 29113
From: Bill Long
Date: 2011 October 10
References: WG5/N1869

Discussion:

ISO/SC22 has directed that the Interop TR should be a Technical
Specification (TS) instead of a Type 2 Technical Report. We keep the
same number, 29113. This paper is to document that conversion.

Edits to N1869:

Change instances of "TR 29113" to "TS29113".

Change instances of "Technical Report" to "Technical Specification".

Replace the boilerplate text in the Forward clause using the ISO TS
boilerplate text, adapted for this TS.
