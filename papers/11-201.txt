NUMBER: TBD
TITLE: Mixing default initialization with DATA initialization
KEYWORDS: DATA, default initialization, explicit initalization
DEFECT TYPE: TBD
STATUS: TDB

QUESTION:

In the following program, one component has a default initialization
and the other is initialized in a DATA statement. Is the program
valid?

  module oad_active
    implicit none
    type active
      integer :: v
      integer :: d = 42
    end type
  end module

  module tots_c
    use oad_active
    implicit none
    type(active), save :: trlkold
    data trlkold%v /100/
  end module

  program foo
    use tots_c
    implicit none
    if (trlkold%d /=  42) stop 'ERROR d /= 42'
    if (trlkold%v /= 100) stop 'ERROR v /= 100'
  end program foo


WG5/N1830 has [p104, 5.4.7, parag. 3]

  If a nonpointer object has default initialization, it shall not
  appear in a data-stmt-object-list.

and [p89, 5.2.3, parag. 1]

  Explicit initialization alternatively may be specified in a DATA
  statement unless the variable is of a derived type for which default
  initialization is specified. [...] A variable, or part of a
  variable, shall not be explicitly initialized more than once in a
  program.

and [p70, 4.5.4.6, parag. 6]

  Explicit initialization in a type declaration statement (5.2)
  overrides default initialization
