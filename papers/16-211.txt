Discussion
----------

A missing edit from the TS to 8.1.6 CRITICAL construct, para 3
addresses the editor's comment. We suggest that this edit be
made. Note also that the final paragraph of clause 6.3 of the TS
should have been included in 8.6.11 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in
image control statements.  It is included in paper J3/16-208.

Further missed edits from the TS to 8.1.6 CRITICAL construct, paras 1
and 3 limit the scope of a CRITICAL construct to a team. See TS 9.7
Edits to clause 8, edit 3. We suggest that these too be made. It is an
important technical change from Fortran 2008.
