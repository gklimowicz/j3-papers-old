Subject:     FYI: Advance Transmittal for ISO/IEC DIS 1539-1
References:  x3j3.1996-256, X3/96-0593


You all will have noticed that the F95 DIS ballot has now begun. The attached 
document (X3/96-0593) is the notification of the corresponding US public 
review and the requirement for X3J3 to establish the US vote on this ballot.

The timings are interesting. The (two month) public review period is Nov 8 - 
Jan 7.  X3J3 is requested to forward its recommendation to X3 no later than 
Dec 11, obviously well before any public review comments are likely to be 
received.  But ours is not to wonder why ... (to coin a poem), so we might as 
well formulate our recommendation in the TAG session during our Nov 11-15 
meeting.

Dear Jerry:

Enclosed is a copy of the Advance Transmittal for ISO/IEC DIS 1539-1, please
review it for X3J3's action items.  Please let me know if you need a copy of
the ISO/IEC DIS 1539-1.

Regards,

Deborah J. Donovan
Coordinator, Stds. Processing, X3
