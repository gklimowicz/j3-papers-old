Subject: Edits for UK comment E22  (Indexing asterisk)
Date: 1 Apr 2003

This revision changes the last edit to index the defining
bnf for asterisk dummy arguments instead of indexing a
restriction on them.  (Indexing both would be ok, but if
we index one, I'd think it should be the defining place).

Comment E22 of the UK vote was:

E22 Annex E
    Page 533
    Asterisk is used for so many different purposes in addition to 
    multiplication, it is confusing to select only one of them for the 
    index.  The entry should be removed or should be made comprehensive.


Index tags for asterisk should be added to:

29:22  (comment indicator for fixed form)
33:24  (multiplication operator)
78:1   (assumed size array dimension)
86:19  (repeat indicator for data initialization)
195:6  (default i/o unit)
195:15 (list-directed i/o indicator)
224:34 (in output field)
235:18 (repeat indicator for list directed data)
278:1  (alternate return)
