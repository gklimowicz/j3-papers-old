Edits (02-007):

189:31 Delete ", or during input from an internal file"

Delete J3 internal note

207:2-4: Replace with "If an end-of-record condition
occurs during execution of an input/output statement that
contains neither an EOR= specifier nor an IOSTAT=
specifier, execution of the program is terminated.
If an end-of-record condition occurs during execution
of an input/output statement that contains either an EOR=
specifier or an IOSTAT= specifier, and an error condition
does not occur"

Delete J3 internal note

207:7: Add at the end of item (1) "If the pad mode has the
value NO, the input list item becomes undefined."

[Neither this nor the description of END= is still
quite right, because I don't think the program is terminated
if there is also an error condition and there is an ERR=
specifier.]

In the 207:2-4 paragraph above (first occurrence) and at
206:28 after "IOSTAT= specifier" add "and an error condition
does not occur"
