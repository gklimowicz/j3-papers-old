Discussion
----------

In my vote (N2013), I said "There has not been adequate discussion of
an image stalling because of the failure of another image, which will
cause it to fail despite there being nothing wrong with its hardware."
I had in mind that executions of remote references such as
       a = b[i]
will cause the executing image to stall if image i has failed. As we
have it now, the processor has to regard the executing image as
permanently failed. Other images that are accessing data from it
will in turn stall and fail too. Thus one failure may lead to a
large number of working images being treated as failed. This is not
satisfactory.

I made a suggestion in my vote for a change to the TS, but now think
that there is a simpler way to handle it. The failure of image i
essentially means that the team calculation has failed and the team
needs to be reconstituted. My suggestion is that there be a transfer
of control of the stalling image to the end of the team construct and
that the image be regarded as failing only within the construct. After
the synchronization at the END TEAM statement, it regains the status
of a working image. For execution within the initial team, there is
no END TEAM statement and the failure is permanent, as now. An access
within a statement such as
      a = b[parent::i]
to a failed image outside the current team should be treated as a
failure within the ancestor team.

The change will cause no alteration to A.1.2. The stalled images will
be reused.



Edits to N2007:
---------------

[13:18] At the end of the sentence "A failed image remains failed for
the remainder of the program execution" add "unless the failure occurs
as described in the next paragraph".

[13:21+] Add paragraph
If an <image-selector> identifies an image that has failed and a team
other than the initial team, the executing image is treated as a failed
image for the rest of the execution of the corresponding CHANGE TEAM
block. The executing image shall transfer control to the END TEAM
statement of the construct.

[13:21+] Change the last sentence to
"The image selector {\tt b[i]} identifies the current team. The image
selector {\tt b[i,team_id=1]} identifies the parent team. The image
selector {\tt b[ancestor::i]} identifies the team {\tt ancestor}.
