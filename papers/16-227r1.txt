Subject: Changes for conformance with revised ISO guidelines
Date: 2016 June 09


1. Introduction

The latest ISO/IEC directives have changes which affect our document.
We should make changes to conform to these guidelines as much as we can
reasonably do.

In previous revisions we were given dispensation to have a different
structure, but it would probably be better to simply conform to what is
required by the directives.  This would change all the clause numbers.
If the committee would prefer to continue to ask for dispensation, the
changes below marks "[clause 1]" should be omitted.

2. Edits to 16-007r1

[throughout] "This part of ISO/IEC 1539" -> "This document", etc.
{Terminology change.}

[clause 1] Split up as follows
  1.1 Scope -> 1. Scope
  1.2 Normative references -> 2. Normative references
  1.3 Terms and definitions -> 3. Terms and definitions
  New clause "4. Notation, Conformance and Compatibility",
  1.4 Notation... -> 4.1 Notation...
  1.5 Conformance -> 4.2 Conformance
  1.6 Compatibility -> 4.3 Compatibility
  1.7 Deleted and obsolescent features -> 4.4 ...
[throughout] renumbering subsequent clauses,
[xx] revise document structure in the Introduction.
{Conform to required structure.}

[normative references] Change the boilerplate text to conform to the
                       new directives.
{This has changed.}

[terms and defns] Change the boilerplate text to conform to the new
                  directives.
{This has changed.}

{also done by a different paper:
 [26:13] "must be different" -> "shall be different".}
[92:16+something]
  "In order for an identifier to be accessed by use association, it must
   have the PUBLIC attribute in the module from which it is accessed."
  ->"An identifier can only be accessed by use association if it has the
     PUBLIC attribute in the module from which it is accessed.".
[160:24+something]
  "for the assignment ... NAME must already be"
  ->"the assignment ... is only conforming if NAME is already".
[164:26+something]
  "For example, if PTR is a pointer component, Z[P]%PTR is a reference to
   the target of component PTR of Z on image P. This target is on image P
   and its association with Z[P]%PTR must have been established by the
   execution of an ALLOCATE statement or a pointer assignment on image
   P."
  ->
  "For example, if PTR is a pointer component, and Z%PTR on image P has
   been associated with a target by execution of an ALLOCATE statement or
   a pointer assignment on image P, Z[P]%PTR will be a reference to that
   target."
[194:34] "must specify" -> "will inevitably specify".
[240:4] "must access" -> "accesses".
[547:28] "must wait" -> "has to wait".
[552:2] "must be prepared" -> "will need to be prepared",
        "must be avoided" -> "will need to be avoided".
[559:5-6] "must be computed" -> "will need to be computed".
[581:1] "must also be written" -> "will also need to be written".
[582:41] "must be specified" -> "need to be specified".
{The term "must" has been clarified to refer to external requirements,
 e.g. legal requirements or the Laws of Physics.  Mathematical or logical
 deductions would not seem to fit "external".}

3. More edits to 16-007r1

The editor has not quite finished examining the directives for other more
obscure requirements that might affect the document.

[anywhere] Make appropriate changes for directive conformance if it appears
           to be necessary.
