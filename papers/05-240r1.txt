Subject: Execute an external program
Date: 2005 July 28

The execute a command line proposal was rated A by WG5
at the Delft meeting.  This paper attempts to provide edits
to implement it.

Previous papers assumed execute_command_line would be
a part of iso_fortran_env and also assumed that that section
would be reorganized to separate the constants and the procedures.
However, that reorganization has not occurred, so this paper places
execute_command_line in the general list of procedures.
It may be subject to a future reorganization if desired.

In Section 13.5.8, page 298, add to the list:

[298:5+] Add:
"EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE  execute an O/S command"

In Section 13.7, add to the list of procedures:

[315:24+] Add:
 "13.7.5+ EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE( COMMAND, [ WAIT,
                                          EXITSTAT, CMDSTAT, CMDMSG ] )

*Description.* Execute the command line identified
               by the string COMMAND.  The processor must support
               synchronous and may support asynchronous execution
               of the external program.

*Class.* Subroutine.

*Arguments.*

COMMAND    shall be of type default character and
           shall be a scalar.  It is an INTENT(IN)
           argument.  It identifies the command line
           to be executed.  The interpretation is
           processor-dependent.

WAIT       shall be of type default logical and shall
(optional) be a scalar.  It is an INTENT(IN) argument.
           When present and true, EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE
           returns after the indicated command line
           has completed execution.  When present and
           false, EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE returns after
           the indicated command line has started
           execution.  When not present, the effect is
           as if present with a value of true.

EXITSTAT   shall be of type default integer and shall
(optional) be a scalar.  It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.
           It shall not be present if WAIT is
           present with a value of false.  If WAIT is
           present with a value of true, the value of
           EXITSTAT is the processor-dependent exit
           status of the command line, if available.
           Otherwise, the value is unchanged.

CMDSTAT    shall be of type default integer and shall
(optional) be a scalar.  It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.
           It is assigned the value zero if
           no error occurred during EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE
           and assigned a processor-dependent
           positive value otherwise.  If an error occurs
           and CMDSTAT is not present, execution of 
           the program terminates.  If the processor
           does not support the concept of command
           lines, the value is 1.

CMDMSG     shall be of type default character and shall
(optional) be a scalar.  It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.
           It is assigned a processor-dependent error
           message if the value of the variable
           associated with the CMDSTAT argument
           indicates an error occurred.  Otherwise,
           the value of CMDMSG is unchanged."
