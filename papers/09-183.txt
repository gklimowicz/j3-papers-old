1.  Discussion

C617  (R611) Except as an actual argument to an intrinsic inquiry
      function or as the <designator> in a type parameter inquiry, a
      <data-ref> shall not be a polymorphic subobject of a coindexed
      object and shall not have a polymorphic allocatable subcomponent.

appears to be broken, in that it prohibits a <data-ref> from having a
polymorphic allocatable subcomponent except if it is an actual argument
to an intrinsic inquiry function or the <designator> in a type
parameter inquiry.

If I remember the discussion that led to it correctly, and if I read
the subject of 08-308r1 correctly, this was an attempt to prohibit
cross-image deduction of dynamic type.

Editor: Replace C617 by the following:

"C617 (R611) Except as an actual argument to an intrinsic inquiry
      function or as the <designator> in a type parameter inquiry, a
      <data-ref> that is a coindexed object shall not be polymorphic
      and shall not have a polymorphic allocatable subcomponent."
