NUMBER: F08/0016
TITLE: Can a vector-subscripted argument become undefined?
KEYWORDS: Vector subscript, actual argument, undefined.
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

According to 6.5.3.2.2 Vector subscript,
  "An array section with a vector subscript shall not be ...
   argument associated with a dummy array that is defined or
   redefined ..."

How can we predict the future?

And even if we could, it implies that it would be ok for the dummy
array to be undefined (because it only forbids becoming defined).

As it happens, c12 already says it is not definable, so already covers
being defined and redefined - and also becoming undefined, and also
prevents not just INTENT(OUT) or INOUT but also ASYNCHRONOUS and
VOLATILE.

What is the point to this future-predicting confusing redundancy?

ANSWER:

This paragraph is completely redundant as well as incomplete.
An edit is supplied to correct this situation.

EDIT:

to 10-007:

[124:4-7] Delete 6.5.3.3.2 paragraph 2.
