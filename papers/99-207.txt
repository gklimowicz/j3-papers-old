 QUESTION:

Consider the program

      INTEGER FUNCTION F(I)
        INTEGER I
        F = I
      END

      PROGRAM MAIN
        INTEGER F
        EXTERNAL F
        CHARACTER*26 STRING
        DATA STRING/'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'/
        PRINT *, LEN( (/ (STRING(1:F(I)), I = 1,0) /) )
      END

Is this Standard Conformant?

If so, what is the defined result?

ANSWER:

Don't know. One can imagine that the answer was intended to be "no"
and that the standard is lacking words. In the alternative, the answer
was intended to be "yes" and the Standard is missing words that assert
that the result is totally processor dependent (including if it's an
error).

Discussion:

To casual reader, this program appears standard conformant.
However, it would seem to the same casual reader, that the result of
running of this program ought to be undefined (or professor defined,
perhaps), but finding anything in the standard to this effect seems
difficult.

FWIW: Sun f90 2.0 allocates a temporary for the length on the
      stack.  After not executing the array constructor, it
      prints the value of the temporary.
