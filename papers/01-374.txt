Subject:  Chapter 3 comments, updated from meeting 158

This is an update of 279/R2 from meeting 158.  I deleted the items
that were taken care of at the last meeting to make it easier for the
B team to process.  I kept the same numbering scheme as in 279 so that
notes from last meeting should still be valid.

Page, etc., numbers have been updated to the current 007/R4 PDF version

3)  Page 28[8+], 3.3.1.2  Is it worth saying that the ";" is not part of the
statement?  Might apply to earlier restriction that a labeled statement
must have a non blank character.  Is
999    ;    ! legal?

4)  Page 28[2+], 3.3.1.1.  We don't appear to cover a line like
       a = 3;
nothing is said about what follows the ;  Is it commentary?  or what?
same thing applies to 3.3.2.1 for fixed form
