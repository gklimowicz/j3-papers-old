Part 1: Interpretation Processing Rules
======================================================================

0. All interpretations are listed in J3 standing document 006.

1. Interpretations are processed by the J3/interp group and given a
   number.  The interpretation is marked "J3 consideration in
   progress".  An answer is formulated and presented to J3 in a
   meeting paper.

2. J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority vote
   marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

3. Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter ballot
   to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed by J3
   meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  An interp answer
   passes by a 2/3rds vote; a no vote must be accompanied by an
   explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's vote
   to yes.

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

4. The chair of J3/interp gathers all interp answers that are marked
   "passed by J3 letter ballot" and forwards them to the WG5
   convenor.  The WG5 convenor holds a ballot of individual members;
   a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the changes
   necessary to change the member's vote to yes.  The answers that
   pass this ballot become "WG5 approved".

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

5. "WG5 approved" answers are processed into a corrigendum document
   by taking the edits from the interp answers and putting them in
   the format required by ISO.  A WG5 vote is made on forwarding the
   corrigendum to SC22.  Interps so forwarded are marked
   "Corrigendum".

6. J3/interp creates a edit for the next Fortran Standard if one is
   needed for all interps marked "Corrigendum".

Part 2: Active F90/F95 interpretations
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F90/0145
TITLE: Expressions in <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement
KEYWORDS: expression - specification, expression - initialization,
          FUNCTION statement, host association, use association
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The syntax rule R1217 shows that the type and type parameters of a
function can be specified in the FUNCTION statement (12.5.2.2).

(a) If a <type-spec> appears in a FUNCTION statement, can the
initialization and specification expressions of that <type-spec>
involve names of entities that are declared within the function or
are accessible there by host or use association?

(b) Section 5.1 states:

      "The <specification-expr> (7.1.6.2) of a <type-param-value>
       (5.1.1.5) or an <array-spec> (5.1.2.4) may be a nonconstant
       expression provided the specification expression is in an
       interface body (12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a
       subprogram."

As a FUNCTION statement is not part of the specification part of a
subprogram, this text in the standard appears to distinguish between
FUNCTION statements that are in interface blocks and ones that are
not. This text seems to prohibit such examples as:

         INTEGER I

              COMMON // I
              ...

where it can be confusing as to which I is being referenced in the
FUNCTION statement.  While host association does not apply to
interface bodies, for consistency should the text quoted from Section
5.1 have been "... is in the specification part of an interface body
(12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a subprogram."?

(c) Section 7.1.6.1 states:

      "If an initialization expression includes a reference to an
       inquiry function for a type parameter or an array bound of an
       object specified in the same <specification-part>, the type
       parameter or array bound must be specified in a prior
       specification of the <specification-part>."

Was this text intended to apply to FUNCTION statements even though
they are not part of any <specification-part>, thus disallowing
fragments such as:

      INTEGER (KIND=KIND(X)) FUNCTION F()
        INTEGER(KIND=KIND(0)) X
        ...

Similar text appears in Section 7.1.6.2.

ANSWER:

(a) A specification expression in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
statement may involve names of entities that are declared within the
function or are accessible there by host or use association, but an
initialization expression in such a <type-spec> may only involve
names that are accessible by host or use association.

(b) No.  It was not the intent of the standard to distinguish between
the two types of FUNCTION statements cited.  As elaborated in the
discussion of part (a), the standard intended to allow the
<type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement to be a nonconstant
expression.  The sentence cited is corrected with a supplied edit.

(c) Yes, the text cited from 7.1.6.1 was intended to apply to
FUNCTION statements.  The sentence quoted and the corresponding
sentence in 7.1.6.2 are corrected with supplied edits.  The code
fragment is not standard conforming.

Discussion:

(a) An initialization expression is a constant expression with an
additional rule relating to exponentiation (7.1.6.1).  Since it is a
constant expression, the only names it can contain are the names of
named constants, structure constructors, intrinsic procedures, and
variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about.

    * Named constant

      Section 5.1.2.1 states:

       "A named constant must not be referenced in any ... context
        unless it has been defined in a prior PARAMETER statement or
        type declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, or
        made accessible by use association or host association."

      Since the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
      scoping unit, there can be no prior PARAMETER statement or type
      declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, so the
      first clause does not apply. A named constant can appear in a
      <type-spec> of a function statement if it is accessible within
      the function by host or use association.

    * Structure constructor

      Rule R502 shows that the only opportunities for expressions to
      appear in <type-spec>s are in a <kind-selector> or in a
      <char-selector>.  However, a structure constructor cannot
      appear in a <kind-selector> because rule R505 shows that a
      <kind-selector> must be an integer expression.  Similarly, R506
      shows that any initialization expression in a <char-selector>
      must be type integer.  Therefore, a structure constructor can
      not appear in an initialization expression in the <type-spec>
      of a FUNCTION statement.

    * Intrinsic procedure

      The intrinsic procedure names or classes of intrinsic
      procedures that may appear in an initialization expression are
      given in 7.1.6.1.

    * Variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about

      The text from section 7.1.6.1 as cited in question (c) was
      intended to apply to initialization expressions in the
      <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement.  With the correction
      supplied, this means that if a variable appears as the argument
      to an inquiry intrinsic in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
      statement, the function must be a module procedure or an
      internal procedure, and the variable must exist in (be
      accessible from) the host scoping unit.

Rule R502 defines <type-spec>.  The only opportunity for a
<type-spec> to contain a <specification-expr> is when the data type
is character (<type-param-value> may be a <specification-expr>).
Section 7.1.6.2 states that a specification expression is a
restricted expression that is scalar, of type integer, and each
operation must be intrinsic.  In addition, rule (2) of 7.1.6.2 states
that a primary of a specification expression can be a dummy argument
that has neither the OPTIONAL nor INTENT(OUT) attribute.  The
following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a dummy argument:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S(N)
              INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: N

Rule (2) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
dummy argument.  Section 6.1.2 indicates that a structure component
must not be referenced or defined before the declaration of the
parent object.  Similar rules are needed to prevent a substring from
being referenced ahead of the declaration of its parent, and an array
element or array section from being referenced ahead of the
declaration of the array.  Edits are provided to supply these rules.
Since a subobject cannot be referenced before its parent object is
declared and the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
subprogram, the parent's declaration could not have occurred.  Thus a
subobject must not be referenced in the <type-spec> on a FUNCTION
statement for objects declared within the function.

Rule (3) states that a primary can be a variable that is in a common
block.  The following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a
common block member:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S()
              ...
              COMMON N

As in rule (2), rule (3) allows a subobject of such a variable but
for the same reasons as above, such a subobject designator cannot
appear in the <type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement.

Rule (4) states that a primary may be a variable that is accessible
by use association or host association.  The following code fragments
demonstrate uses of such variables:

              PROGRAM MAIN
              INTEGER :: N = 21
              ...
              CONTAINS
                CHARACTER(LEN = 2*N) FUNCTION SS(K)    ! N is host
                ...                                    !  associated.
                END FUNCTION
              END PROGRAM

    and

              MODULE MOD
              INTEGER K
              DATA K /20/
              END MODULE

              CHARACTER*(K*2) FUNCTION CHECK(STR)      ! K is use
                                                       !  associated.
              USE MOD
              ...
              END FUNCTION

Rule (4) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
use or host associated variable.

A structure constructor cannot appear in a FUNCTION <type-spec>
specification expression because the expression must be of type
integer and any operations (which might yield an integer value from
one or more structure constructors) must be intrinsic.

Other rules of 7.1.6.2 state which intrinsic procedure names or
classes of intrinsic procedures may appear in a specification
expression.

Section 7.1.6.2 also states:

        A variable in a specification expression must have its type
        and type parameters, if any, specified by a previous
        declaration in the same scoping unit, or by the implicit type
        rules currently in effect for the scoping unit, or by host or
        use association.

The discussion above regarding specification expressions has already
ruled out "previous declarations" so the first clause of the cited
sentence does not apply.  The other clauses apply equally to a
FUNCTION statement <type-spec> and to type declaration statements
inside the function.

(b) When the discussion for part (a) is applied to the code fragment
provided, it means that the 'I' referenced in the <type-spec> of the
FUNCTION statement is the common block member.

13.7 [300:13-15] incorrectly requires an infinite result or a
NaN result to always signal some IEEE exception.

Consider changing [300:13] "infinite result" to "infinite result
(from finite arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical
operations on infinity that produce an infinity are
unexceptional.

Consider changing [300:14] "NaN result" to "NaN result (from
non-NaN arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical operations
on quiet NaN operands that produce a quiet NaN result are
unexceptional.

Consider adding to 13.7 [300:15+] something along the lines of:
"Unless specified otherwise, a math function with NaN
argument(s) shall return a NaN, which should be one of the NaN
arguments."  This allows not having to specify the results for
each specific math function.

Consider adding the above suggested cases to each of the 13.7.*
functions, perhaps, with a bold face IEEE sub-heading.

ANSWER:

The erroneous text quoted from 13.7 in Fortran 2003 has been revised
in Fortran 2008, and again by Corrigendum 2 for Fortran 2008, and now
no longer conflicts with the IEEE-754 standard.

To specify the results of all the intrinsics for non-normal values is
beyond the scope of an interpretation.  This could be considered for a
future revision.

TITLE: Repeat specifiers and UDDTIO

DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m

  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i
    INTEGER :: j
  END TYPE

  INTEGER :: ipos

  INTERFACE READ(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedReadT
  END INTERFACE

CONTAINS

  SUBROUTINE formattedReadT (dtv, unit, iotype, vlist, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: unit
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: iotype
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: vlist(:)
    INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: iostat
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

    READ(unit, *) dtv%i
    INQUIRE(unit, POS=ipos)
    READ(unit, *) dtv%j
  END SUBROUTINE

END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  TYPE(t) :: a
  OPEN(10, FILE='file.txt', ACCESS='stream', FORM='formatted')
  WRITE(10, '(A)') '2*3 5'
  REWIND(10)
  READ(10, *) a
  PRINT *, a%i, a%j, ipos
END PROGRAM

10.9 of Fortran 2003 states that the r*c form of list-directed input
is equivalent to r occurrences of c.  So, when the read is performed,
it is as if the input record contains two occurrences of the number 3.

The first child read statement reads the first 3, and does not advance
the file position to the next record (because it is a child data
transfer statement).  It appears that the second read statement should
read the second 3.  But the file position between the child read
statements is unclear.

What does the above program print?

ANSWER:

The standard does specify the behavior of a processor when a list
directed input record contains a r*c constant, but that is irrelevant
to the question at hand.  Executing an INQUIRE statement using an
internal unit is prohibited by [235:16] 9.10.2.1p2.  The program does
not conform.

The question raised at m200 was about the definition of "internal unit
(9.6.4.8.3)" [226:4], which seems to conflict with the Terms and
Definitions [12:26-31]:

    1.3.94
     internal file
      character variable that is connected to an internal unit (9.4)

    1.3.95
     internal unit
      input/output unit that is connected to an internal file (9.5.4)

The clarification we needed but couldn't find is probably [208:8-10]:

    An internal unit is used to refer to an internal file and is
    specified by an internal-file-variable or a file-unit-number
    whose value is equal to the unit argument of an active defined
    input/output procedure (9.6.4.8).

  Rich Bleikamp's NO comment for F03/0059:

    The replacement text reads "if the variable would not be processed
    by a UDDTIO ...", but I think the presence of an object designator
    might actually determine whether or not the object designator is
    processed by a UDDTIO routine (sort of the reverse decision
    process than what is being suggested, where being processed by a
    UDDTIO routine precludes the use of a non-simple variable name in
    the input record).

    Second, the sentence immediately after the replaced text talks
    about "Successive qualifications" being applied to the name.  I
    think this reads awkwardly with the suggested edit.

    Third, I think the answer may be wrong.  For namelist input, we
    should allow (perhaps we already do) object designators all the
    time, and just not invoke the UDDTIO routine if the object
    designator is not a simple  variable name, or if the resulting
    objects datatype/shape do not match an existing interface for a
    UDDTIO routine.  Also, its not clear to me (its too late in the
    day), but perhaps we really want to allow an object designator
    that's an array element reference to invoke a UDDTIO routine.
    We could use the datatype and shape of the object designator to
    determine whether or not a UDDTIO routine should be invoked
    (still a compile time decision).  I'm not at all sure we'd want
    to allow component references in such a case, or perhaps a
    component reference in the input record just precludes the
    possibility of invoking a UDDTIO routine for that input value.

    The tradeoffs here are:
    1) allow some more functionality (which we may already allow),
       such as array element references appearing in a namelist input
       record (as a namelist group object name, possibly qualified),
       and still cause a UDDTIO routine to be invoked, and

    2) keep the rules simple enough that the user and compiler's I/O
      library can easily agree on what's supposed to happen, and
      what input values are therefore allowed.

    I was going to suggest a replacement edit, but my head hurts too
    much :).

TITLE: IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE in a subroutine
KEYWORDS: IEEE_ARITHMETIC
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Section 7.1.7 of the Fortran 2008 standard says that if the value of an
expression can be determined before execution of the program, it is
standard-conforming to use the predetermined value.

Consider the subprogram

        SUBROUTINE S()
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES

        INTEGER, PARAMETER :: sp = IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND(6,30)
        real(sp) :: X = 0.5559013_sp
        real(sp) :: Y = 1.2092481_sp
        real(sp) :: Z1, Z2
        IF (IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING(IEEE_NEAREST,X) .AND. &
            IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING(IEEE_UP,X)) THEN
            CALL IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE(IEEE_UP)
            Z1 = X*Y
            CALL IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE(IEEE_NEAREST)
            Z2 = X*Y
            PRINT *, 'Residual: ', Z1 - Z2
        ENDIF
        END

(1) Is a processor permitted always to print zero for the residual
    Z1 - Z2 ?
(2) Same question, after giving X and Y the PARAMETER attribute.

ANSWER:

(1) Yes.  The processor is allowed to evaluate expressions (constant
or otherwise) in any mathematically equivalent way.  In particular, it
is permitted to evaluate using higher precision than any precision
available when the program is executed.  For example, it might compute
Z1 == Z2 == 0.67222259081253, then compute Z1 - Z2 == 0.0, regardless
of how the program might do rounding at the seventh decimal digit when
it is executed.

(2) Yes, for the same reasons as question (1).

Bader NO vote:

The answers given to both (1) and (2) in the interp appear to me
to be counterintuitive; the programmer would expect that the
calculation of Z1 and Z2 respectively obey the imposed rounding
mode. In particular, I suspect there are situations where it is
more obvious to the compiler than to the programmer that expressions
are evaluated at compile time, and that different processors may
have differing capabilities in identifying such expressions. The
resolution of such situations is one target that the IEEE facilities
were designed for. I therefore am in favor of the stance that, if
supported, the setting of the rounding mode should take precedence
over processor-dependent compile-time evaluations.

Corbett NO vote:

I disagree with the interpretation given.  I believe that the
assignments should require conversions to be done and that the
conversions should be done in accord with the rounding mode
currently in effect.  Therefore, the results should not be zero.

Long NO vote:

I was confused by John's comment that the rounding mode on
entry to the subroutine affected the value of Z1 since the computation
of Z1 follows a call that resets the rounding mode.  I think the real
question here is what the standard means by "mathematical".  I had
always thought in terms of things like algebra.  John's answer seems
to imply that computational numerics (as specified by IEEE) are part
of the concept of "mathematical".  In other contexts, I think that
John's interpretation could be harmful.  On the other hand, the
current answer does seem to make the usefulness of the
IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE routine more limited that would be
expected. Also, does the concept of mathematically equivalent apply to
the aggregation of multiple statements, or does it apply to just one
expression?  A processor that used the "mathematically equivalent"
argument to get 0 would need to forward sub the expressions for Z1 and
Z2 into the print statement to get X*Y - X*Y.  I don't think we
intended to allow forward substitution of expressions across one of
the IEEE mode setting routines.

Maclaren comment:

This relates to F03/0065, but is the other way round.  Unlike that one,
I consider this consistent with the majority of the semantic wording in
the C standard.

Muxworthy No vote:

I agree with John's vote.

Reid NO vote:

The IEEE rounding mode on entry to the procedure may vary from
call to call. The value of Z1 depends on this rounding mode.
Therefore, the processor should not always print zero for Z1-Z2.
Whether or not Z1 and Z2 have the PARAMETER attribute makes no
difference. Yes, the processor is allowed to evaluate an
expression in any mathematically equivalent way, but here the
mathematics dictates that a particular form of rounding, defined
in the IEEE standard, be applied.

Snyder NO vote:

    The answer makes rounding mode changes pointless.

    The work-around usually advanced to cause rounding mode changes to
    have effect (but not advanced in the answer to the interpretation)
    is to store intermediate results that are computed with different
    rounding modes in VOLATILE variables if they are ultimately to be
    combined in a single expression.

    Subclause 5.3.19 states, in part, however, that "The VOLATILE
    attribute specifies that an object may be referenced, defined, or
    become undefined, by means not specified by the program."  Setting
    the rounding mode is done by means that ARE specified by the
    program, so the advice is not germane.  One who reads subclauses
    5.3.19, 14.4, 14.11.6, and 14.11.21, and the answer to this
    interpretation, might not realize that the use of VOLATILE variables
    is required, under the present interpretation, for subclauses 14.4,
    14.11.6, and 14.11.21 to be meaningful.

    A better answer would have been to amend 7.1.5.2.4 to require that
    all entities within the expression are evaluated with the same
    rounding mode, or to specify that quantities evaluated with
    different rounding modes cannot be considered to be mathematically
    equivalent, even if evaluated by textually identical expressions.
    This might require processors either to abandon certain
    optimizations, or to perform more detailed dataflow analysis that
    propagates rounding mode to determine when those optimizations are
    permitted.

    If the position implied by the answer to this interpretation is to
    be maintained, the absence of edits is entirely inadequate.  The
    definition of VOLATILE must be changed to encompass actions that ARE
    specified by the program, and to encompass advice concerning
    rounding mode changes.  Advice to store intermediate results that
    are computed with different rounding modes into VOLATILE variables,
    if they are to be combined in a single expression, must be included
    in subclauses 14.4 and 14.11.21.

    During the requirements phase for the 2008 standard, there was a
    request (in 04-219) for a "strict mode" similar to that described in
    section G.2 of the Ada standard, in which rounding mode settings
    would actually have an effect without needing to resort to VOLATILE
    variables.  If a "strict mode" had been provided, it might have made
    sense to allow a processor to ignore rounding mode changes outside
    strict regions.  A request for a "strict mode" will be presented
    during the requirements-gathering phase for the next revision of the
    standard, for this as well as other reasons.

No it does not.  IEEE peculiarities play no part in the mathematical
Reals.

IEEE is merely one form of computer arithmetic.  (It would make very
bad mathematics, since IEEE numbers are not even a subset of the
2-point compactification of the Reals, thus nearly all mathematical
identities and theorems about the Reals would get destroyed.)  Computer
arithmetic is *computational* not *mathematical*.  ALL computer
arithmetics frequently give different computational answers for
mathematically-equivalent expressions.

And I cannot believe you are again trotting out this nonsense saying
constant expressions should not be treated as constant.  If I have
   "REAL(KIND=INT(a+b)) :: x(INT(a+b)) = a+b; y=a+b",
with a and b being floating-point named constants, I am not allowed
to evaluate a+b at compile time?  Surely you jest.  Or I can in the
KIND= but not in the array bound?  Unless the array is in COMMON or
has the SAVE attribute?  Surely you jest even more.  Or I can
everywhere except in the "y ="?  You cannot be serious.

Furthermore, the rationale you are using is applicable to all routines
regardless of whether they call IEEE_SET_ROUNDING and would thereby
destroy many basic optimisations.  You.Really.Can.Not.Be.Serious.

TITLE: Precise FP semantics of the REAL intrinsic
KEYWORDS: REAL intrinsic
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting 

QUESTION:

Must the intrinsic function REAL with KIND argument wp return a value
that is a REAL (KIND=wp) floating point number?

RATIONALE FOR THE QUESTION:

Computer hardware may use a wider floating-point format for registers
than for memory; e.g., 80 bits for registers and 64 bits for memory
for the case of standard double precision floating point numbers. Some
algorithms require a high level of control over floating point
semantics.  If the intrinsic function REAL with KIND parameter wp is
guaranteed to return a REAL (KIND=wp) result then a programmer can use
this to force intermediate results into main memory format, never mind
that the optimizing compiler may have placed the intermediate in a
register.

I am interested in a J3 interpretation of this matter, especially a
loud and clear affirmative interpretation, because it appears that
some present Fortran compilers optimize away my explicit use of the
REAL intrinsic with a KIND=wp argument.  The context is code for
compensated summation (Kahan summation).  I appreciate that
parentheses are inviolable courtesy of the Fortran standard, but in
order to have code that cannot be broken by an optimizing compiler I
seem to need also a language mechanism to force intermediate results
into main memory format.  The VOLATILE attribute is a large hammer,
and the standard does not actually say that assigning a value to a
variable with that attribute forces the result to main memory format.

ANALYSIS:

The fourth sentence of the second paragraph of subclause 13.7.1, as
amended by Corrigendum 2, states:

   "A program is prohibited from invoking an intrinsic procedure under
    circumstances where a value to be returned in a subroutine
    argument or function result is outside the range of values
    representable by objects of the specified type and type
    parameters."

However common optimizations have allowed the REAL intrinsic to be
ignored in an expression when the result is mathematically equivalent
to including the evaluation of the REAL intrinsic.  Requiring the
evaluation of the REAL intrinsic in all circumstances would be adding a
new feature, incompatible with existing F2008 interpretations, and would
be limiting optimizations on which Fortran customers rely.

ANSWER:

10-007r1 [141:20-21] 7.1.5.2.4p2, says:

   "Once the interpretation of a numeric intrinsic operation is
    established, the processor may evaluate any mathematically
    equivalent expression, provided that the integrity of parentheses
    is not violated."

The interpretation of this paragraph has always meant that the REAL
intrinsic may return a mathematically equivalent result.  The interp
process must not be used to add a new feature, incompatible with existing
practice.

TITLE: G0 edit descriptor and floating-point output
KEYWORDS: G edit descriptor, 0 width
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

For data types other than floating-point, the effect of the G0 edit
descriptor is precisely defined.  For floating-point output, the
effect is precisely defined only if the value is an IEEE NaN or
Infinity, the result is otherwise left up to the processor to select
"reasonable" values for w, e, and d (if d is unspecified).

The standard states [258:7-9 10.7.5.2.2p2]:

      "the G0 and G0.d edit descriptors follow the rules for the
       Gw.dEe edit descriptor, except that any leading or trailing
       blanks are removed".

One might deduce from the wording of this that there is no upper limit
on the choice of w, since the production of additional leading (or
trailing) blanks has no effect on the output.

Q1. Is a value for w or e that results in the field being filled with
    asterisks reasonable?  This is not, after all, an error condition.

Q2. Is a value for d that results in significant loss of precision
    reasonable?  E.g. d==1, or for a less extreme example,
    d==PRECISION(value)/2.

Q3. Is a value for d that produces many more digits than the precision
    reasonable?  E.g. d==1000000.  Or, for a less extreme example,
    d==PRECISION(quad) with a single precision value.

Q4. Is a value for e that produces many more digits in the exponent
    than the exponent range reasonable?  E.g. e==1000000.

Q5. If the standard cannot tell me what "reasonable" means, what
    purpose does it serve for it to say that it must be reasonable?
    I cannot see how to tell whether a processor conforms to the
    standard in this respect.

DISCUSSION:

The standard permits, but does not require, the "best" values of w, d
or e to be chosen for each internal value.

ANSWER:

A1. No, that is not reasonable.  An edit is supplied to clarify the
    meaning of "reasonable".

A2. No, a value of d that results in a significant loss of precision
    is not reasonable.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A3. No, it is not reasonable for d to be ridiculously large.
    An edit is supplied to clarify the intent.

A4. No, e should not be bigger than that required to represent the
    largest finite machine-representable number.  An edit is
    supplied to specify this.

A5. Yes, the use of the word "reasonable" in this context is entirely
    meaningless.  An edit is supplied to remove this misleading
    terminology.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

In 10.7.5.2.2, paragraph 2:

[258:9] In 10.7.5.2.2p2 last sentence:
  "Reasonable processor-dependent" -> "Processor-dependent".
{A5.}

[258:10] In 7.5.2.2p2 last sentence, after "value" insert
  ", that do not result in the field being filled with asterisks".
{A1.}

[258:10] Append new sentences to 10.7.5.2.2p2:
  "The value of <d> shall not result in the production of an output
   value that differs from the internal value by more than
   100*SPACING(value), and shall not be more than two larger than the
   maximum number of digits that might be required to distinguish
   between two different machine numbers of the kind of the internal
   value.  The value of <e> shall not be so large that the exponent
   would have a leading zero both when the internal value is the
   largest finite machine number and when it is the smallest finite
   machine number of that kind."
{The first sentence limits the choice of <d> to lose no more than 2
 digits of precision (A2) and to have no more than 2 spurious digits
 of  precision (A3); for some floating-point formats, the upper bound
 is not strong, being d <= 2+MAX(PRECISION(value)+2,RANGE(value)*2).
 The second sentence would allow e==4 for a lop-sided exponent range,
 e.g. -1100 to +900, but would limit e to at most 3 if the exponent
 range is e.g. -308 to +308 (A4).
 Neither of these restrictions prevent a processor from producing
 fewer mantissa or exponent digits for particular values if that does
 not result in serious loss of accuracy.}

F08/0029
Corbett NO vote:
I agree that the word "reasonable" should not appear in the
Fortran standard.  The first two proposed edits should be
incorporated.  The third edit should not be adopted.

I object to the third edit on general grounds.  The issues dealt
within the third edit should be matters of "quality of
implementation."  I see no reason for the Fortran standard to
restrict implementors' choices in this area.

I also object to the third edit on specific grounds.  The
proposed edit makes no provision for nonzero scale factors.  If
a nonzero scale factor is in effect, an implementation might
reasonably choose a value of d that is outside the range
specified by the edit, if only to avoid the scale factor being
outside the allowed range of values.

The phrase
    and shall not be no more than two larger than the
    maximum number of digits that might be required to
    distinguish between       two different machine
    numbers of the kind of the internal value.
should say either "any" between "between" and "two",
or should say "all pairs of" instead of "two."

NUMBER: F08/0041
TITLE:  Segment ordering rules
KEYWORDS: segment, allocation
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

(1) Was it intended to allow the allocation of a variable that is not
    a subobject of a coarray to be unordered with respect to its
    definition by another image through a pointer component of a
    coarray?

For example,

  PROGRAM example1
    TYPE t1
      REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: c(:)
    END TYPE
    TYPE t2
      TYPE(t1),POINTER :: p
    END TYPE
    TYPE(t1),TARGET :: x
    TYPE(t2) :: y[*]
    y%p => x                         ! y[n]%p => x[n] for all n.
    SYNC ALL
    IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
      ALLOCATE(x%c(1000))            ! Allocates x[1]%c.
    ELSE
      y[1]%p%c(THIS_IMAGE()) = 999   ! Defines some part of x[1]%c.
    END IF
  END PROGRAM

(2) If a variable is already defined (initially or by some segment
    that precedes all other segments in this question), may one image
    reference it while another image causes it to become undefined in
    unordered segments?

For example, is

  PROGRAM example2
    REAL :: x(100)[*]
    x = 1
    SYNC ALL
    IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
      PRINT *,SUM(x)
    ELSE
      CALL destroy(x)
    END IF
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE destroy(x)
      REAL,INTENT(OUT) :: x(:)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END PROGRAM

standard-conforming?  This does not appear to violate any of the
segment ordering requirements in 8.5.2 because it is not defined in
any unordered segment (so bullet 1 does not apply), there is no
allocation or pointer association status (so bullet 2 does not apply),
and there is no dummy argument being defined (so bullet 3 does not
apply).

ANSWER:

(1) No, this example violates the requirement of the first bullet in
    paragraph 3 of 8.5.2, which says:
      "if a variable is defined on an image in a segment, it shall not
       be referenced, defined, or become undefined in a segment on
       another image unless the segments are ordered".
    x[1]%c is defined in segment 2 by images 2-N, but is made
    undefined on image 1 (allocation makes a variable undefined except
    when default initialization occurs).

(2) No, this example was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An
    edit is supplied to clarify the intent.

EDITS to 10-007:

[189:14] In 8.5.2 paragraph 3, first bullet point,
  After "if a variable is defined"
  Insert "or becomes undefined"
  (before "on an image in a segment").
{Forbid uncoordinated undefinings of variables.}

** start negative comments
  John Reid's NO vote on F08/0041:

    There are errors in both examples. In example (1), the component of
    type t2 should have type t1. In example (2), the PRINT statement
    should reference x on another image, e.g. PRINT *, x(1)[2].

    More seriously, the edit proposed in 10-201 has been removed. While
    it is not necessary for allocation, it is needed for pointer
    association.  This means that it is desirable to rewrite the
    questions and answers.  Here is my suggestion

    QUESTION:

    (1) If a variable is already defined (initially or by some segment
        that precedes all other segments in this question), may one
        image reference it while another image causes it to become
        undefined in unordered segments?

    For example, is

      PROGRAM example2
        REAL :: x(100)[*]
        x = 1
        SYNC ALL
        IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
          PRINT *,x(1)[2]
        ELSE
          CALL destroy(x)
        END IF
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE destroy(x)
          REAL,INTENT(OUT) :: x(:)
        END SUBROUTINE
      END PROGRAM

    standard-conforming?  This does not appear to violate any of the
    segment ordering requirements in 8.5.2 because it is not defined in
    any unordered segment (so bullet 1 does not apply), there is no
    allocation or pointer association status (so bullet 2 does not
    apply), and there is no dummy argument being defined (so bullet 3
    does not apply).

    (2) Was it intended to allow a pointer assignment to a pointer that
        is not a subobject of a coarray to be unordered with respect to
        its definition by another image through a pointer component of
        a coarray?

    For example,

      PROGRAM example1
        TYPE t
          REAL,POINTER :: p
        END TYPE
        REAL,TARGET :: a=0.0, b=1.0
        TYPE(t) :: y[*]
        y%p => a                         ! y[n]%p => a for all n.
        SYNC ALL
        IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
          y%p => b                       ! y[1]%p => b
        ELSE
          y[1]%p = 999                   ! Defines a[1] or b[1]?
        END IF
      END PROGRAM

    (1) No. This case has been overlooked in the segment ordering rules.

         image unless the segments are ordered, and".

  Van Snyder's No vote on F08/0041:

    "is defined" is a static concept.  The requirement should
     always have been "becomes defined".  Therefore the edit should
     be to replace "variable is defined" to "variable becomes
     defined or undefined" -- or do we need another interp to
     repair this?

  Jim Xia's No vote on F08/0041:

    The first example should be fixed to have t2 contains a pointer
    component of type t1.  The second example is perfectly legal.  Seems
    we need to rework on this interp.

  result of ballot on F08/0041:

    In example (1), the component of type t2 is changed to type t1.
    However, more work is needed on this interp as a result of these
    comments => F08/0041 fails.

TITLE:  constraints on entities of type LOCK_TYPE
KEYWORDS: lock, polymorphism
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

  Program example
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env, Only:lock_type
    type :: m
      class(*), allocatable :: lock
    end type
    type(m) :: om[*]
    allocate(lock_type :: om%lock)
    call inner(om)                  ! Problem call.
  Contains
    Subroutine inner(omm)
      Type(m),Intent(Out) :: omm
      Print *,Allocated(omm%lock)
    End Subroutine
  End Program

Constraint C1304 attempts to prohibit a variable with a LOCK_TYPE
subobject from appearing in a variable definition context, such as the
call to inner, but the dynamic type of om%lock cannot be determined
statically.

Is this program standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The example was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An ALLOCATE
statement with a <type-spec> should not have been permitted to add
components of type LOCK_TYPE; an edit is supplied to correct this
error.

EDITS to 10-007:

[127:7] In C641,

    ", LOCK_TYPE (13.8.2.16), or a type with a direct component of
     type LOCK_TYPE that is not a direct component of the declared
     type of any <allocate-object>,".
{Fix condition to prohibit LOCK_TYPE and any type with a LOCK_TYPE
 direct component.  Note that we only want to prohibit "new" lock_type
 components from appearing in the <type-spec>, we don't want to forbid

** start negative comments
  Jim Xia's No vote on F08/0045:

    The edits makes it illegal to specify LOCK_TYPE as <type-spec> if
    the coarray itself is of LOCK_TYPE.  For example,
      type(lock_type), allocatable :: locks[*]
    The edits make the following allocate statement illegal
      ALLOCATE (LOCK_TYPE: locks[*])

  result of ballot on F08/0045:

    /interp will take this back for more work since we think that Jim
    has a valid complaint => F08/0045 fails

TITLE:  Variable-denoting function references change existing
        semantics
KEYWORDS: Pointer function, argument, ASSOCIATE, SELECT TYPE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Questions 1-3 use this module:

  Module m200c2
    Integer,Target :: x = 42
  Contains
    Function fx()
      Integer,Pointer :: fx
      fx => x
    End Function
  End Module

Q1. Consider this main program

  Program q1
    Use m200c2
    Call test(x,fx())                  ! The call.
  Contains
    Subroutine test(a,b)
      Integer :: a,b
      a = a*10                         ! The assignment.
      Print *,a,b
    End Subroutine
  End Program

According to Fortran 2003, "fx()" in the CALL statement is an
expression and not a variable, and has the value 42.  It follows
that the assignment "a = a*10" is standard-conforming and does
not affect the value of B.  Therefore this program prints
 420 42

However, according to Fortran 2008, "fx()" in the CALL statement is a
variable, and therefore the assignment does not conform to the
standard because it affects the value of B and so violates 12.5.2.13
item (3) which requires all updates to B to go through the dummy
argument, and therefore the behaviour of the program is unspecified.

This conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that all Fortran 2003
programs remain conforming in Fortran 2008.

Is this program intended to remain standard-conforming?

Q2. Consider this main program

  Program q2
    Use m200c2
    Call test(x,fx())                  ! The call.
  Contains
    Subroutine test(a,b)
      Integer,Target :: a,b
      a = a*10                         ! The assignment.
      Print *,a,b
    End Subroutine
  End Program

According to Fortran 2003, "fx()" in the CALL statement is an
expression and not a variable, and has the value 42.  It follows
that the assignment "a = a*10" is standard-conforming and does
not affect the value of B.  Therefore this program prints
 420 42

However, according to Fortran 2008, "fx()" in the CALL statement is a
variable, and therefore the assignment to A affects the value of B, so
the program will print
 420 420

This apparently conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that Fortran
2008 is an upwards compatible extension to Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics?

Q3. Consider this main program

  Program q3
    Use m200c2
    Associate(y=>fx())   ! The association.
      x = 0              ! The assignment.
      Print *,x,y
    End Associate
  End Program

This main program apparently conforms to both Fortran 2003 and Fortran
2008, but according to Fortran 2003 "fx()" in the association is an
expression, evaluated on entry to the construct, and therefore Y
becomes associated with the value 42, and therefore the program prints
the values (spacing may differ)

 0 42

whereas according to Fortran 2008 "fx()" in the association is a
variable, and every reference to Y is a reference to the associated
variable, so the assignment also changes the value of Y and therefore
the program prints the values

 0 0

This apparently conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that Fortran
2008 is an upwards compatible extension to Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics?

Q4. Consider this program

  Module m200c2_q4
    Integer,Target :: x = 42
  Contains
    Function fx()
      Class(*),Pointer :: fx
      fx => x
    End Function
  End Module
  Program q4
    Use m200c2_q4
    Select Type (q=>fx())
    Type Is (Integer)
      x = 0
      Print *,x,q
    End Select
  End Program

Using the same logic as Q2, this should print the values
 0 42
in Fortran 2003, but the values
 0 0
in Fortran 2008.

Again, this is not upwards compatible with Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics.

-----------------------
From N1990: F08/0089

Corbett reason for NO vote

Questions Q1 and Q2 assume that if a pointer actual argument
has the form of an expression and the corresponding dummy
argument is a nonpointer dummy argument without the VALUE
attribute, the dummy argument becomes argument associated
with the value of the target of the value of the pointer
actual argument.  On the newsgroup comp.lang.fortran, Ian
Harvey pointed out that the Fortran standards do not support
that premise.  Paragraph 2 of Clause 12.5.2.3 of the
Fortran 2008 standard states

     If a nonpointer dummy argument without the VALUE
     attribute corresponds to a pointer actual argument
     that is pointer associated with a target, the
     dummy argument becomes argument associated with
     that target.

Paragraph 8 of Clause 12.4.1.2 of the Fortran 2003 standard
states

     Except in references to intrinsic inquiry functions,
     if the dummy argument is not a pointer and the
     corresponding actual argument is a pointer, the
     actual argument shall be associated with a target
     and the dummy argument becomes argument associated
     with that target.

Paragraph 6 of Clause 12.4.1.1 of the Fortran 95 standard
states

     If the dummy argument is not a pointer and the
     corresponding actual argument is a pointer, the
     actual argument shall be currently associated
     with a target and the dummy argument becomes
     argument associated with that target

The paragraph added between paragraphs 3 and 4 of
Clause 12.4.1.1 of the Fortran 90 standard by
Corrigendum 2 states

     If the dummy argument is not a pointer and the
     corresponding actual argument is, the actual
     argument must be currently associated with a
     target and the dummy argument becomes argument
     associated with that target.

That text was added as a result of interpretation
F90/000039.

In the examples given in questions Q1 and Q2, the
actual argument fx() is a pointer actual argument
corresponding to a nonpointer dummy argument.
Therefore, the dummy argument becomes argument
associated with the target of the pointer actual
argument, which is the module variable x.  The dummy
argument does not become argument associated with the
value of the target of the pointer.  Thus, there is
no semantic difference between Fortran 2008 and the
previous standards in this regard.

The answers and edits given for questions Q1 and Q2 are
based on the same premise as the questions themselves
and should be rejected.

I asked people to compile and run the example programs
given in questions Q1 and Q2 and variations of them
using a variety of compilers.  In most, but not all,
cases, the results were consistent with the semantics
stated in the Fortran standards, not with the semantics
assumed by questions Q1 and Q2.

Questions Q3 and Q4 are consistent with the standards,
as are the corresponding answers and edits, but I do not
care for the nature of the changes that will result if
interpretation F08/0075 is passed.  I think changing the
language so that the form of a function reference
determines its meaning is a mistake.

Long comment:

Twice in the edits appears "...a <function-reference> to a
pointer function is regarded as a variable...". Should this
be a "data pointer function"?

Snyder comment:

The term "pointer function" is not used as a noun,
although "nonpointer function" is so used at [454:36].
I have a slight preference that "pointer function" in
the edit for [24:11+] be replaced by "function that
returns a pointer result" in both paragraphs.  The
same change ought to be made in the edits for [24:27+]
and [25:6+]

A parallel change ought to be made at [454:36], but
that can be done editorially rather than within this
interpretration.

QUESTION:

Is the following subprogram required always to print "T T"?

  subroutine Wobbly ( N )
    integer, volatile :: N
    integer :: A ( n, n )
    integer :: B ( n * n )
    print *, size(a) == size(b), size(a,1) == size(a,2)
  end subroutine Wobbly

ANSWER:

No.

There are three specification expressions in the subroutine, and the
volatile variable N appears in each of them.  Since, being volatile,
the variable N might have a different value each time it is
referenced, these three specification expressions might receive
different values for their references to N.  If that happens, the
array sizes might well be different.

QUESTION:

Q1. Does the following program fragment conform to the 2008 standard?

  subroutine S ( P )
    interface
      subroutine Q ( X )
        real, intent(inout) :: X
      end subroutine Q
    end interface
    interface
      subroutine P ( A )
        import
        procedure (R) :: A
      end subroutine P
    end interface
    procedure (Q) :: R
  end subroutine S

12.4.3.3p2 says "If an entity that is made accessible by this means is
accessed by host association and is defined in the host scoping unit, it
shall be explicitly declared prior to the interface body."

However, although the procedure R is declared in the host scoping unit
it is not defined in the host scoping unit, so this is ineffective.

Q2. If the IMPORT statement were changed to "IMPORT R", would that be
    conforming?

12.4.3.3p1 says
  "An entity that is imported in this manner and is defined in the
   host scoping unit shall be explicitly declared prior to the
   interface body."

Again, procedure R is declared but not defined in the host scoping
unit, so this requirement is ineffective.

ANSWER:

These examples were not intended to conform to the Fortran standard.
An edit is provided.

TITLE: NAMELIST and multiple occurrences of a variable
KEYWORD: NAMELIST
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider

  Program p1
    Real :: x = 3, y = 4
    Namelist /n/ x, y
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

According to 5.6,
  "The order in which the variables are specified in the NAMELIST
   statement determines the order in which the values appear on
   output."

However, this stops short of saying that the order is the same, merely
that it determines it.  Perhaps it might be standard-conforming for a
processor to always produce the values in reverse order, for example.
10.11.4 does not seem to address the issue of what the order is.

Q1: Is the order meant to be the same?

Consider

  Program p2
    Real :: x = 3, y = 4
    Namelist /n/ x, y, x
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

This program did not conform to Fortran 90, but does conform to
Fortran 2003 and later.  The Fortran 2008 standard says (5.6p2):

  "The order in which the variables are specified in the NAMELIST
   statement determines the order in which the values appear on
   output."

However, there are only two variables in the NAMELIST statement, X
and Y.  Therefore it seems to be ambiguous whether the output should
be something like
  &N X=3 Y=4 /
or
  &N Y=4 X=3 /

Some compilers produce
  &N X=3 Y=4 X=3 /
but this is not an ordering of the variables X and Y.

Q2. Is this program intended to conform to the standard, and if so,
    what is the intended output?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, the order is meant to be the same.  An edit is supplied to
    clarify this.

A2. The program was intended to conform to the standard, and the output
    was intended to be the third option.  An edit is supplied to
    correct the text in 5.6.

According to the standard, the type of the result of MERGE is the same
as the type of TSOURCE.  One might imagine that this means that the
result is polymorphic if and only if TSOURCE is polymorphic.  This
would be a slightly unusual and unexpected asymmetry.

Also, the types of FSOURCE and TSOURCE have to be the same.  If this
means both the declared and dynamic types, one might imagine that this
means that the result is polymorphic if and only if both FSOURCE and
TSOURCE are polymorphic, since otherwise the non-polymorphic argument
decides the type.

On the other hand, if the type requirements are talking about the
declared type only, one might imagine that the result is polymorphic
if either TSOURCE or FSOURCE is polymorphic.

However, in any case there would seem to be an error in the standard,
since the result is specified to be the same as TSOURCE, rather than
the same as whichever argument is chosen to be the result value; if
this refers to the dynamic type, it is contradictory when FSOURCE is
chosen as the result value.  And if it does not refer to the dynamic
type, there appears to be no statement which says what the dynamic
type of the result is.

Q1.  Is the apparent asymmetry between the treatment of TSOURCE and
     FSOURCE intended?

Q2.  Which of the MERGE invocations A-E are polymorphic?

Q3.  When the result of MERGE is polymorphic, are the dynamic types of
     TSOURCE and FSOURCE permitted to be different?  And if they are,
     is the dynamic type of the result the same as the chosen argument
     and not necessarily the same as TSOURCE?

ANSWER:

A1. There is no asymmetry between TSOURCE and FSOURCE, because they
    are required to have the same type and type parameters.  This
    means that both the declared and dynamic types and type parameters
    must be the same.

A2. Only MERGE invocation E is polymorphic.  An edit is provided to
    clarify this.

A3. No, the dynamic types and type parameters are required to be the
    same.

Note that because MERGE is elemental, it needs the type and type
parameters to be the same for both the declared and dynamic types,
otherwise the principle that all elements of an array have the same
(declared and dynamic) type and type parameters would be broken.

The procedure pointers are all associated with the internal procedure

pointer at each nesting level has a different host instance, which
might lead one to believe that the answer is no (and that therefore
only one of each of the 3-element sequences printed will be T).

ANSWER:

No, the program does not print all true values; two procedure pointers
to the "same" internal procedure are only associated if the host
instances are also the same.  An edit is supplied to the standard to
clarify this.

TITLE: IEEE Inquiry Functions
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

All references are to Fortran 2008 10-007r1.

On comp.lang.fortran Francis Coudert asked
 The Fortran 2008 standard defines an inquiry function
 as an "intrinsic function, or function in an intrinsic
 module, whose result depends on the properties of one
 or more of its arguments instead of their values".
 10-007r1 section 1.3.89 [11:27-30]

 I wonder: by that definition, how can the
 IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING(FLAG) function from the
 IEEE_EXCEPTIONS intrinsic module be an inquiry function?
 Its result depends on the value of FLAG, not its
 properties.

QUESTIONS:

Question 1.

Are the functions

 IEEE_support_flag
 IEEE_support_halting
 IEEE_support_rounding
 c_associated
 c_funloc
 c_loc

intended to be inquiry functions?

Question 2.

Are they consistent with the definition of inquiry
functions?

Question 3.

Are they allowed in Specification expressions?

Question 4.

Are they allowed in Constant expressions?

ANSWERS:

Answer 1.

No.  These intrinsic module functions

 IEEE_support_flag
 IEEE_support_halting
 IEEE_support_rounding
 c_associated
 c_funloc
 c_loc

are not inquiry functions because their results depend on other than
the properties of their arguments.  Edits are provided to correctly
identify these functions as transformational:

[18:35-37] section 1.3.146
transformational function
intrinsic function, or function in an intrinsic module, that
is neither elemental nor an inquiry function

Answer 2.

No.  Their current classification is inconsistent with the definition
of inquiry functions.

Answer 3.

They should be allowed in specification expressions.  Edits are
provided to correct this.

Answer 4.

No. Only the 3 IEEE_* functions should be allowed in constant
expressions, not the 3 C_* functions.  Edits are provided to correct
this.

TITLE: Is the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute allowed with the VALUE attribute?
KEYWORDS: ASYNCHRONOUS, VALUE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

In the description of the VALUE attribute, [101:23-24] section
5.3.18p1, constraint C558 disallows the VOLATILE attribute with the
VALUE attribute:

  "C558 An entity with the VALUE attribute shall not have the
        ALLOCATABLE, INTENT (INOUT), INTENT (OUT), POINTER, or
        VOLATILE attributes."

But there is no prohibition of the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute with the
VALUE attribute.  Should this combination also be disallowed?

ANSWER:

No, the combination of VALUE and ASYNCHRONOUS attributes should not be
disallowed.  That is, the combination of VALUE and ASYNCHRONOUS
attributes should continue to be allowed.

A dummy argument with the VALUE attribute is not argument associated
with the corresponding actual argument.  Rather, it is associated with
an anonymous data object whose value is copied from the actual
argument before execution of the executable constructs of the
subprogram commences, and before expressions in the specification part
are evaluated.  Therefore, it can successfully take part in
asynchronous operations that both start and complete within that
procedure call, independently of whether the corresponding actual
argument has or has not the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute.

There is no problem if a dummy argument has the VALUE attribute and
the corresponding actual argument has the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute,
independently of whether the dummy argument has the ASYNCHRONOUS
attribute.  Subclause 9.6.4.1, paragraph 6 [220:13-15], prohibits an
actual argument that is part of a pending input storage sequence
affector from being associated with a dummy argument that has the
VALUE attribute.

QUESTION:

Was it intended that MOVE_ALLOC can affect the allocation status of an
array on an image other than the executing image? An example is

     CALL MOVE_ALLOC(A,B[I]%A)

ANSWER:

No, it was not intended that the executing image can affect the
allocation status of an array on an image other than the executing
image. Edits are provided to correct this.

NUMBER: F08/0107
TITLE: LOCK_TYPE, ultimate components, subcomponents, and coarrays
KEYWORD: LOCK_TYPE, ultimate components, subcomponents, coarrays
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

DISCUSSION:

Constraint C433 in subclause 4.5.2.1 reads:

C433 (R425) If EXTENDS appears and the type being defined has an
  ultimate component of type LOCK_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO
  FORTRAN ENV, its parent type shall have an ultimate component of type
  LOCK TYPE.

This was intended to prevent compromising protection of objects of type
LOCK_TYPE by using type extension and polymorphism.

According to subclause 1.3.33.4, an ultimate component is a

  component that is of intrinsic type, a pointer, or allocatable; or an
  ultimate component of a nonpointer nonallocatable component of derived
  type

The type LOCK_TYPE is not intrinsic.  Therefore, if a type has a
nonallocatable component of type LOCK_TYPE, it does not have an ultimate
component of type LOCK_TYPE.  Therefore, constraint C433 fails to
protect entities of type LOCK_TYPE.

Constraint C433 prohibits reasonable constructions, such as extending
the type LOCK_TYPE, or extending a type that has an allocatable
component that has a component of type LOCK_TYPE, because the parent
type does not have an ultimate component of type LOCK_TYPE.

Constraint C1302 in subclause 13.8.2.16 reads:

C1302 A named variable of type LOCK TYPE shall be a coarray. A named
  variable with a noncoarray subcomponent of type LOCK TYPE shall be a
  coarray.

This was intended to require that components of type LOCK_TYPE, at any
level of component selection, be coarrays.

According to subclause 1.3.33.3, a subcomponent is a

  <structure> direct component that is a subobject of a structure

According to subclause 1.3.33.1, a direct component is

  one of the components, or one of the direct components of a nonpointer
  nonallocatable component.

The definition of the term "subcomponent" does not include components of
allocatable components.  Therefore, because of the use of the term
"subcomponent," if an object has an allocatable component that in turn
has a component of type LOCK_TYPE, C1302 can fail to require a component
of type LOCK_TYPE to be a coarray.

QUESTIONS:

Assume type LOCK_TYPE from ISO_Fortran_Env is accessible.

1. Is the definition of type One below standard conforming?

type, extends(LOCK_TYPE) :: One
  type(lock_type), allocatable :: LOCK
end type One

2. Is the definition of type Four below standard conforming?

type :: Two
  type(lock_type), allocatable :: LOCK[:]
end type Two

type :: Three
  type(two), allocatable :: L
end type Three

Type, extends(Three) :: Four
  type(lock_type), allocatable :: LOCK[:]
end type Four

3. Is the definition of type Six below standard conforming?

type :: Five
end type Five

type, extends(Five) :: Six
  type(two), allocatable :: L
end type Six

4. Is the declaration of the variable X below standard conforming?

  type :: Seven
    type(lock_type) :: L
  end type Seven

  type :: Eight
    type(seven), allocatable :: C
  end type Eight

  type(eight) :: X

ANSWERS:

1. This was intended to be permitted.  An edit is provided to repair
   the constraint on adding a LOCK_TYPE component during type
   extension.

2. This was intended to be permitted.  An edit is provided to repair
   the constraint on adding a LOCK_TYPE component during type
   extension.

3. This was not intended to be permitted.  An edit is provided to
   repair the constraint on adding a LOCK_TYPE component during type
   extension.

4. This was not intended to be permitted.  An edit is provided to
   repair the constraint on declaring objects which have a potential
   subobject of type LOCK_TYPE.

ANSWERS:

1. Type two is not conforming, because the entity A has a coarray
   ultimate component and C525 requires such an entity to be a
   nonpointer nonallocatable scalar.  Therefore the declaration of V
   is not permitted.

2. X satisfies C525, so declaration of X is permitted.  X has an
   ultimate (allocatable) coarray component (A[:]), and therefore
   according to C526 must be a dummy argument or have the SAVE attribute.

QUESTION:

Assume type LOCK_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_Fortran_Env is
available.

Q1. Is allocation of X%C permitted?

  TYPE t
    TYPE(LOCK_TYPE),ALLOCATABLE :: c
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t) :: x[*],y[*]
  ALLOCATE(y%c)
  ALLOCATE(x%c,SOURCE=y%c)

Q2. Is allocation of C permitted?

  class(*), pointer :: C
  type(lock_type), intent(in) :: L[*]

  allocate ( C, source=L )

Q3. Is allocation of C permitted?

  class(*), pointer :: C

  allocate ( LOCK_TYPE :: C )

Q4. Is pointer assignment to C permitted?

  class(*), pointer :: C
  type(lock_type), intent(in), target :: L[*]

  c => L

Q5. Is this ALLOCATE statement conforming?

  CLASS(*),ALLOCATABLE, SAVE :: C[:]
  TYPE(LOCK_TYPE),      SAVE :: X[*]
  ALLOCATE(C[*],MOLD=X)

ANSWER:

A1. Allocation of X%C is not intended to be allowed.  An edit is
    supplied to correct the requirements on allocation of LOCK_TYPE.

A2. Allocation of C is not intended to be allowed.  An edit is
    supplied to correct the requirements on allocation of LOCK_TYPE.

A3. This allocation of C is permitted.  It cannot violate C1302 because
    that is a syntax constraint.  Only things that are statically
    detectable static properties of the program source text can be
    syntax constraints.  That means that "type" in C1302 can only mean
    "declared type".

    C is CLASS(*) so has no declared type and therefore cannot
    violate C1302.

    Edits are given to fix C1302 to say "declared type" explicitly to
    avoid this confusion.

    Note that it is impossible to actually use the allocated target of
    C in any useful fashion; SELECT TYPE cannot access it because the
    associate-name would be a named lock variable, but it is not a
    coarray so that would not be allowed.

    So this is permitted, but useless, and because it is useless it is
    also harmless.  A future revision could disallow this without the
    concomitant incompatibility inconveniencing any programs.

A4. Pointer assignment to C is permitted.

    As in A3, this is useless but harmless.  A future revision could
    disallow this without the concomitant incompatibility
    inconveniencing any programs.

A5. This statement was intended to be permitted.  An edit is supplied
    to correct the requirements.

Note that the term "potential subobject component" is defined in interp
F08/0124 and will be in F2008 Corrigendum 4:

  [6:7+] After definition 1.3.33.2 parent component, insert new term
    "1.3.33.2a
     potential subobject component
     nonpointer component, or potential subobject component of a
     nonpointer component".

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[127:8-9] 6.7.1.1 Syntax, C642,
          Change "C_PTR," to "C_PTR or"
          Delete ", LOCK_TYPE ... LOCK_TYPE".

[127:9+] Insert new constraint
  "C642a (R627) If SOURCE= appears, the declared type of <source-expr>
         shall not be LOCK_TYPE or have a potential subobject
         component of type LOCK_TYPE."

[127:18-19] 6.7.1.1, p4,
  Instead of the edit in Corr. 2, make this change to the 10-007r1 text:

    Change "If <allocate-object> is" -> "If an ALLOCATE statement
            has a SOURCE= specifier and an <allocate-object> that is".
    {There is no problem with MOLD=.  "subcomponent" works ok here
     because we have an object not a type.}

  so p4 reads:

    "If an ALLOCATE statement has a SOURCE= specifier and an
     <allocate-object> that is a coarray, <source-expr> shall not have a
     dynamic type of C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, or LOCK_TYPE, or have a
     subcomponent whose dynamic type is LOCK_TYPE."

ANSWERS:

1. According to 9.12p5 [243:3-5]

  "The value of a specifier in an input/output statement shall not
  depend on the definition or evaluation of any other specifier in the
  <io-control-spec-list> or <inquire-spec-list> in that statement."

the INQUIRE statements are prohibited because the values of the
variables EXIST and OPENED depend upon the values of the FILE= and
UNIT= specifiers, respectively.  They were intended to be permitted.
Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

2. According to 9.12p6 [243:6-8]

  "The value of any subscript or substring bound of a variable that
  appears in a specifier in an input/output statement shall not depend
  on any <input-item>, <io-implied-do> <do-variable>, or on the
  definition or evaluation of any other specifier in the
  <io-control-spec> or <inquire-spec> in that statement."

the INQUIRE statement is not prohibited because U is not a subscript
or substring bound.

According to 7.1.4p2 [139:3-4]

  "The evaluation of a function reference shall neither affect nor be
   affected by the evaluation of any other entity within the
   statement."

the INQUIRE statement is not prohibited because, although U is
assigned a value, it is not evaluated.

The INQUIRE statement was intended to be prohibited.  Edits are
provided to correct this mistake.

3. According to 9.12p6 [243:6-8]

  "The value of any subscript or substring bound of a variable that
  appears in a specifier in an input/output statement shall not depend
  on any <input-item>, <io-implied-do> <do-variable>, or on the
  definition or evaluation of any other specifier in the
  <io-control-spec> or <inquire-spec> in that statement."

and 9.12p7 [243:9-11]

  "In a data transfer statement, the variable specified in an IOSTAT=,
  IOMSG=, or SIZE= specifier, if any, shall not be associated with any
  entity in the ... <namelist-group-object-list>...."

and 9.12p8 [243:12-14]

  "In a data transfer statement, if a variable specified in an
  IOSTAT=, IOMSG=, or SIZE= specifier is an array element reference,
  its subscript values shall not be affected by the data transfer, the
  <io-implied-do> processing, or the definition or evaluation of any
  other specifier in the <io-control-spec-list>."

the READ statement is not prohibited because V does not "depend on any
<input-item>, <io-implied-do> <do-variable>, or on the definition or
evaluation of any other specifier in the <io-control-spec> or
<inquire-spec> in that statement."   Although V is input from
namelist, it is not "the variable specified in an IOSTAT=, IOMSG=, or
SIZE= specifier."  The READ statement was intended to be prohibited.
Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[243:3-5 9.12p5] Within the second sentence, provided by Corrigendum
2, replace "values of any <input-item> or" with "value of any".
Append ", or be affected by data transfer caused by that statement".
That sentence becomes

  "The value of an <internal-file-variable> or of a FMT=, ID=, IOMSG=,
   IOSTAT=, or SIZE= specifier shall not depend on the value of any
   <io-implied-do> <do-variable> in the same statement, or be affected
   by data transfer caused by that statement."

{Using "data transfer" instead of "<input-item>" covers the namelist
case.}

[243:6-7 9.12p6] Replace "value of any subscript or substring bound of
a variable" with "denotation of a data object".  Replace "depend ...
<do-variable>, or on" with "be affected by the data transfer, the
<io-implied-do> processing, or".
The paragraph becomes

  "The denotation of a data object that appears in a specifier in an
   input/output statement shall not be affected by the data transfer,
   the <io-implied-do> processing, or the definition or evaluation of
   any other specifier in the <io-control-spec-list> or
   <inquire-spec-list> in that statement."

After the paragraph, insert a note:

  NOTE 9.nn
  The semantics of how a variable is denoted is its "denotation";
  this includes such things as component selection, array element
  selection, and pointer function evaluation.

{Using "data transfer" instead of "<input-item>" covers the namelist
case.}

[243:9 9.12p7] "Insert "ID=," before "IOSTAT".

{Not mentioned in a question, but was a problem.}

[243:12-14 9.12p8] Repairing the paragraph would make it equivalent
(if not identical) to 9.12p6, as revised above.  Therefore, delete
the paragraph.

Malcolm:
 I'm sorry, but this draft corrigendum makes 9.12p5 say
   "The value of an \si{internal-file-variable} ... shall not ... be 
   affected by data transfer caused by that statement."
 And yet, this is the ENTIRE PURPOSE of a WRITE to an internal file, 
 to affect the value of the internal-file-variable by means of data 
 transfer!
 
 It is clear that we cannot cover everything in a single sentence, 
 since the requirements on input and output statements should be quite 
 different.  More words are needed.

 (20) The edits for F08/0110 need to be pulled (see previous message), 
 but anyway, the edit instructions refer to the "fifth paragraph, 
 provided by Technical Corrigendum 2", but in fact the fifth paragraph 
 was NOT "provided" by corrigendum 2, but merely edited by it.  So 
 those instructions should be "fifth paragraph, as edited by Technical 
 Corrigendum 2" (or "after applying the changes in ...", which phrasing 
 you used elsewhere).



Result:
 All 9.12 edits are from F08/0110 which is being pulled from Corr 4:

  Remove the edits for F08/0110: [243:3-5, 6-7, 9, 12-14].  F08/0110

ANSWERS:

1. Item (1) in subclause 16.6.6 says

  "When a scalar variable of intrinsic type becomes defined, all totally
  associated variables of different type become undefined....  When a
  scalar variable becomes undefined, all partially associated double
  precision scalar variables become undefined."

D is not totally associated with I.  I does not become undefined.
Therefore, D does not become undefined.  D ought to become undefined.
Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

2. Item (1) in subclause 16.6.6 says

  "When a double precision scalar variable becomes defined, all
  partially associated scalar variables become undefined."

P is partly associated with C, and therefore C becomes undefined by the
assignment to the scalar variable P.  C ought not to become undefined.
Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

3. Item (1) in subclause 16.6.6 says

  "When a scalar variable becomes undefined, all partially associated
  double precision scalar variables become undefined."

  Subclause 16.6.1p5 says

  "A complex... scalar object is defined if and only if all of its
  subobjects are defined."

The association of the scalar variable D2 with an INTENT(OUT) dummy
argument causes it become undefined.  16.6.6p1(1) does not specify that
when a scalar real variable becomes undefined, a totally associated part
of a complex variable becomes undefined.  Assuming C%IM ought to become
undefined, then C ought to become undefined, even though C%RE is not
undefined.  D1 is associated with the C%RE, and therefore becomes
undefined when C%IM becomes undefined.  C%IM ought to become undefined,
and D1 ought not to become undefined.  Edits are provided to correct
this mistake.

4. Item (1) in subclause 16.6.6 says

  "When a scalar variable of intrinsic type becomes defined, all totally
  associated variables of different type become undefined.

X and Y are totally associated, and of different type, but neither one is
of intrinsic type.  Therefore, Y does not become undefined as a
consequence of X becoming defined.  Y ought to become undefined.  Edits
are provided to correct this mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

In Subclause 16.6.6p1, item(1), within the first sentence, remove "of
intrinsic type".  Before "different" insert "the same type with
different values of kind type parameters, or of"

In Subclause 16.6.6p1, replace item(1) with the following four sentences
(all in one paragraph)

  "When a scalar variable becomes defined, all totally associated
  variables of different type become undefined.

{Removing "of intrinsic type" from the existing first sentence of
16.6.6p1(1) addresses question 4.}

  When a scalar variable becomes defined, all partially associated
  variables of different type, or of the same type if corresponding kind
  type parameters have different values, become undefined, unless the
  scalar variable is totally associated with a subobject of the
  partially associated variable, that subobject is of the same type as
  the scalar variable, and corresponding kind type parameters have the
  same values.

{This addresses questions 1 and 2.  The references to kind type
parameter values address the possibility of partially associating a
double precision variable with a default real variable.  Default real
and double precision are now the same type (since 1990), but with a
different kind type parameter value.}

  When a scalar variable becomes undefined, all partially associated
  variables become undefined, unless the partially associated variable
  is totally associated with a subobject of the scalar variable that
  does not become undefined.

  When a scalar variable becomes undefined, all totally associated
  subobjects of other variables become undefined if those subobjects are
  of different type from the scalar variable, or corresponding kind type
  parameters have different values."

only set on successful execution and the latter is only set on an
error condition).  There appears to be no restrictions at all on any
dependencies from ACQUIRED_LOCK=.

In the LOCK statement (F), there is a dependency between the STAT=
specifier and the lock variable.  Similarly for the UNLOCK (G), there
is a dependency between the lock variable and the ERRMSG= specifier.

In the SYNC IMAGES statement (H), there is a dependency between the
STAT= variable and the image set.  In the SYNC IMAGES statement (I),
there is a dependency between the ERRMSG= variable and the image set.

TITLE: Can LOCK_TYPE components have the POINTER attribute?
KEYWORD: LOCK_TYPE component, POINTER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Assume LOCK_TYPE is accessible from ISO_Fortran_Env.

QUESTION:

The following type definition and variable declaration are permitted by
C1302:

  type :: One
    type(lock_type), pointer :: L
  end type One

  type(one), allocatable :: L1[*]

C1302 requires a named variable of LOCK_TYPE to be a coarray.  C526
requires a coarray to be allocatable or to have the SAVE attribute.

The following declaration is apparently prohibited because L4 is
not a coarray:

  type(lock_type), pointer :: L4

Was it intended that pointer components of type LOCK_TYPE be permitted,
but that named variables of type LOCK_TYPE with the POINTER attribute be
prohibited?

ANSWER:

It was intended that components of type LOCK_TYPE not be permitted to
have the POINTER attribute.  Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

  Malcolm Cohen's No vote on F08/0114:

    This is just the wrong decision.  People use pointers for all
    kinds of reasons, e.g. switching between two different structures,
    emulating optionality, etc.  We allow pointers to be followed
    cross-image from a coarray, which means that pointers with a
    potential subobject of type LOCK_TYPE would indeed be useful
    in such scenarios.

    We should not add this new restriction; rather, we should remove
    the misguided "style preference" that is currently badly expressed
    by C1302.

  Robert Corbett's yes vote with Comment on F08/0114:

    I find the text of the proposed edit difficult to read.  I prefer

      "C1302a A component that is of type LOCK_TYPE or that has a

              shall not have the POINTER attribute.".

Is the call to "Fred" standard-conforming?

It is not excluded by 5.3.4p2, because 'array' is merely associated
with 'arg' in subroutine Fred, and not used in any executable
statement or specification expression there.  However, if copy-in/out
is used for argument passing and the actual i/o transfer occurs in
between the copy-in and copy-out, the wrong answers will be given.

QUESTION:

In all cases, Alf is a Fortran procedure like this:

    SUBROUTINE Alf (Arg) BIND(C,NAME='Alf')
        INTERFACE
            SUBROUTINE Arg () BIND(C)
            END SUBROUTINE Arg
        END INTERFACE
        CALL Arg
    END SUBROUTINE Alf

Q1. Consider

    extern void Bert (void) {
        ;
    }

    int main (void) {
        Alf(Bert);
    }

15.5.1p2 requires a procedure defined by means other than Fortran to
have the same binding label as the interface.  Function Bert() has a
binding label of 'Bert', but 15.5.2p2 states that the dummy argument
Arg has no binding label, therefore 15.5.1p2 is not satisfied.

Was this intended to be conforming?

Q2. Consider

    static void Fred (void) {
        ;
    }

    int main (void) {
        Alf(Fred);
    }

15.5.1p2 requires a procedure defined by means other than Fortran to
have a name that has external linkage as defined by 6.2.2 of ISO/IEC
9899:1999.  Function Fred() has no such name, as its definition has
internal linkage.  However, linkage in C affects only the visibility
of the external name, and has no application to either types or
values, whether in the form of function parameters or other pointers.

Was this intended to be conforming?

Q3. Consider

    extern inline void arg (void) {
        ;
    }

    int main (void) {
        Alf(Joe);
    }

C99 6.7.4 describes the inline specifier.  This does not prevent it
from having external linkage, but
  "An inline definition does not provide an external definition for
   the function"
i.e. despite having external linkage, there might be no external
definition that could be invoked from Fortran.

Was it not an oversight not to exclude inline in 15.5.1?

A1. Yes, this was intended to be conforming.  An edit is provided to
    correct this mistake.

A2. Yes, this was intended to be conforming.  An edit is provided to
    correct this mistake.

A3. A C function with no external definition is not "defined by
    means other than Fortran" so much as "not defined".  This was
    not intended to be conforming.  An edit is provided to clarify
    this situation.

DISCUSSION:

This program is modifying an actual argument while it is associated
with a dummy argument.  That is normally prohibited by the anti-aliasing
rules in 12.5.2.13, but these do not operate in the TARGET dummy
argument case.  However, coindexed actual arguments are accessing
remote memory, so in general will be passed by copy-in/out; in this
case permitting aliasing is not reasonable.

The program is not intended to be conforming.  Edits are provided to

TITLE: Types with coarray components
KEYWORD: Coarrays, derived types
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTIONS:

Q1.  Consider

   Module m
     Type t
       Real,Allocatable :: co[:]
     End Type
     Type(t) x
     Real,Allocatable :: xco[:]
   Contains
     Subroutine dubious
       Volatile x
       Volatile xco
       ...
     End Subroutine
   End Module
   Program bad
     Use m
     Volatile x
     Volatile xco
     ...
   End Program

5.3.19 C560 says "The VOLATILE attribute shall not be specified for a
coarray that is accessed by use (11.2.2) or host (16.5.1.4)
association."

That means that the two "VOLATILE XCO" statements are not conforming.
However, the "VOLATILE X" statements have essentially the same effect,
but are unaffected by the constraint, which seems inconsistent.

Was this constraint also intended to apply to objects with coarray
components?

Q2.  Consider

    Program blockvolatile
      Type t
        Real,Allocatable :: co[:]
      End Type
      Type(t) x
      Real,Allocatable :: xco[:]
      ...
      Block
        Volatile x
        Volatile xco
      End Block

5.3.19 C561 says "Within a BLOCK construct (8.1.4), the VOLATILE
attribute shall not be specified for a coarray that is not a construct
entity (16.4) of that construct."

That means that VOLATILE XCO is not standard-conforming.  However, the
constraint apparently does not apply to X, so VOLATILE X is standard-
conforming, even though it has essentially the same effect as the
forbidden case.

Was this constraint intended also to apply to objects with coarray
components?

Q3. 5.3.19p1 says "A noncoarray object that has the VOLATILE attribute
    may be associated with an object that does not have the VOLATILE
    attribute..."; does this apply to objects with a coarray component?

Q4. 12.4.2.2p1 says "A procedure other than a statement function shall
    have an explicit interface if it is referenced and ... (2) the
    procedure has a dummy argument that ... (c) is a coarray, ...."

    Is this intended also to apply to objects with coarray components?

Q5.  Consider:

    Program volatility
      Type t
        Real,Allocatable :: co[:]
      End Type
      Type(t) :: x
      Type(t),Volatile :: y
      ...
      Call s1(x)
      Call s2(x) ! Dummy is volatile, X is not.
      Call s1(y) ! Y is volatile, dummy is not.
      Call s2(y)
    Contains
      Subroutine s1(a)
        Type(t) :: a
        ...
      End Subroutine
      Subroutine s2(b)
        Type(t),Volatile :: b
        ...
      End Subroutine
    End Program

12.5.2.8p1 says "If the dummy argument is a coarray, the corresponding
actual argument shall be a coarray and shall have the VOLATILE
attribute if and only if the dummy argument has the VOLATILE
attribute."

That means that if the program were passing the component CO directly
(and the TYPE(T) declarations in S1 and S2 were changed to REAL), the
second and third calls would not be conforming because of the VOLATILE
mismatch.

It seems inconsistent that there is no requirement for VOLATILE to
match when there are coarray components, since it has the same effect
that X%CO is VOLATILE in S2 but not in the caller, and Y%CO is
VOLATILE in the caller but not in S1.

Was this requirement also intended to apply to objects with coarray
components?

Q6. 12.8.1 C1289 says "All dummy arguments of an elemental procedure
    shall be scalar noncoarray dummy data objects and shall not have
    the POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attribute."

    Is this intended also to apply to objects with coarray components?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, this constraint was intended to apply to objects with coarray
    components.  An edit is supplied to correct this omission.

A2. Yes, this constraint was intended to apply to objects with coarray
    components.  An edit is supplied to correct this omission.

A3. No, this does not apply to objects with coarray components, as
    there is no way of giving the noncoarray parts of the object the
    VOLATILE attribute without giving the coarray part the VOLATILE
    attribute, which is forbidden.  That the quoted text gives
    permission for a noncoarray to have the VOLATILE attribute does
    not override any other requirements in the standard.

A4. No.  A dummy argument that has a coarray component is still just
    an ordinary dummy argument, so this text does not apply.

A5. Yes, this requirement was intended to apply to objects with
    coarray components.  An edit is supplied to correct this omission.

NUMBER: F08/0123
TITLE: SPACING intrinsic
KEYWORDS: SPACING
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider the following program

  Program test_spacing
    Real :: x, y, tiny_spacing, z
    x = Tiny(x)
    y  = Nearest(x,1.0)
    tiny_spacing = y - x
    If (tiny_spacing>0) Then
      ! Probably IEEE arithmetic with subnormals:
      ! the spacing y - x is representable.
    Else
      ! Probably no subnormals, so y - z is not representable.
      tiny_spacing = Tiny(x)
    End If
    z = Spacing(x)
    If (z/=tiny_spacing) Then
      Print *,'FAIL'
    Else
      Print *,'ok'
    End If
  End Program

Furthermore let us assume that the processor supports IEEE arithmetic
with subnormals, and that default REAL is IEEE single precision.

According to Fortran 95, the result for SPACING is:
  "If X is not zero, the result has the value b**(e-p), where b, e,
   and p are as defined in 13.7.1 for the model representation of X,
   provided this result is within range."
therefore the program is expected to print the value "ok".

However, according to Fortran 2008, the result for SPACING is:
  "If X does not have the value zero ..., the result has the value
   b**max(e-p,emin-1), where ..."
Unsurprisingly, e-p is not equal to max(e-p,emin-1) for smallish
numbers, and therefore the program would be expected to print the
value "FAIL".  However, there is no such incompatibility with Fortran
90/95 listed in clause 1, therefore the standard contradicts itself.
(The value specified in Fortran 2008 also contradicts the Description
of the function which says "Spacing of model numbers (13.4)", since
it does not even attempt to return that value.)

Is the new specification a deliberate incompatibility or a mistake?

DISCUSSION:

The description of SPACING was changed in Fortran 2003 by paper
01-361r2 "Comments on Section 13", which contains no justification for
this technical change and indeed does not even mention it is a
technical change - there is just the bare edit (buried in a huge list
of bare edits) with no indication as to why.  This would seem to
indicate that the technical change is an inadvertent error (presumably
the paper simply forgot about subnormal numbers and assumed the new
formula gave the same result as the old one).

ANSWER:

The new wording of SPACING inadvertently changed the return values
when IEEE subnormal values were available.  An edit is provided to
correct this mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[389:4-5] 13.7.157 SPACING (X), p5 Result Value,
          Change "max(e-p,emin-1)" to "e-p" where e and p are in italics.
          After "that of X" insert
            ", provided this result is representable; otherwise the
             result is the same as that of TINY (X).",
          Change "; if there are two such values" to
          "If there are two extended model values equally near to X,".

This makes the whole paragraph read:

 If X does not have the value zero and is not an IEEE infinity or NaN,
 the result has the value b**(e-p), where b, e, and p are as defined
 in 13.4 for the value nearest to X in the model for real values whose
 kind type parameter is that of X, provided this result is
 representable; otherwise the result is the same as that of TINY (X).
 If there are two extended model values equally near to X, the value
 of greater absolute value is taken.  If X has the value zero, the
 result is the same as that of TINY (X).  If X is an IEEE infinity,
 the result is an IEEE NaN.  If X is an IEEE NaN, the result is that
 NaN."

where "b**(e-p)" represents the typesetting of $b^{e-p}$ and throughout
the edits, "b", "e" and "p" are in italics.

TITLE: Coindexed object with polymorphic subcomponent
KEYWORD: Coindexed object, polymorphic subcomponent
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4
QUESTION:

Consider the following type definitions and object declarations:

  Type t1
    Class(*),Allocatable :: bad
  End Type

  Type t2
    Type(t1),Allocatable :: oops
  End Type

  Type(t2) y[*]

Do the following subroutine calls conform to the Fortran 2008 standard?

  Call s1(x[2])
  Call s2(y[2])

DISCUSSION:

If Y[2]%OOPS and Y[2]%OOPS%BAD are both allocated they are subobjects,
but only OOPS is a subcomponent of Y[2].  Since OOPS is not
polymorphic and BAD is not a subcomponent, this clearly does not
violate C617.  That seems inconsistent since in both cases a copy of
the coindexed variable would necessarily copy the polymorphic BAD
component.

ANSWER:

The intent of C617 was to prevent copying a polymorphic subobject of
a coindexed object.  Since a subobject is not always a subcomponent,
an edit is provided to correct the mistake of using the term
"subcomponent" in C617.

TITLE: Definition of objects of type LOCK_TYPE with pointer subobjects
KEYWORD: pointer subobject, variable definition context, LOCK_TYPE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Does the following conform to the Fortran 2008 standard?

  type :: t
    type(lock_type), pointer :: P = NULL()
  end type t

  type(t), parameter :: N = t(null())
  type(t) :: V
  type(lock_type), target :: L

1 nullify ( v%p )

2 v%p => l

3 v = n

ANSWER:

Constraint C1303 prohibits a variable of type LOCK_TYPE from appearing
in a variable definition context, with a few exceptions that do not
include statements 1 and 2.  Subclause 16.6.7 specifies that the
appearance of a variable as a <pointer-object> in a <nullify-stmt>, or
as a <data- pointer-object> or <proc-pointer-object> in a <pointer-
assignment-stmt>, is a variable association context.  Therefore
statements 1 and 2 do not conform to the Fortran 2008 standard.

The appearance of a <pointer-object> in a <nullify-stmt>, or of a <data-
pointer-object> or <proc-pointer-object> in a <pointer-assignment-stmt>,
are pointer association contexts, and are listed as such in subclause
16.6.8; they ought not to be listed as variable definition contexts in
subclause 16.6.7.

{The above proposition was advocated in 14-139r3, accepted at meeting
204, and incorporated into 14-007r2.  Therefore, statements 1 and 2 will
conform to the next revision of the Fortran standard.  Whether
statements 1 and 2 ought to be included in the present question can be
decided in due course.}

Constraint C1304 prohibits a variable with a subobject of type LOCK_TYPE
from appearing in a variable definition context, with a few exceptions
that do not include statement 3.  Therefore statement 3 does not conform
to the Fortran 2008 standard.

{The proposition that the prohibition should only apply to variables
that have nonpointer subobjects of the type EVENT_TYPE being developed
in TS 18508 was accepted, and incorporated into 14-231/N2027.}

Statements 1-3 are harmless, and ought to be permitted.  Edits are
provided to correct this.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[399:22 C1304] Insert "nonpointer" before "subobject".

{A change parallel to this, concerning EVENT_TYPE, is already
incorporated in 14-231/N2027.}

EDITS already applied in 14-007r2:

[312:33+ C1283(1)+] Insert a list item

  "(1a) in a pointer association context (16.6.8),"

{This is a knock-on effect due to deleting pointer association contexts
from the list of variable definition contexts.  It recovers items (2),
(3) and (12) from 16.6.7p1, which are deleted below.}

[313:1-2 C1283(5)]  Delete "with INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT)" from item
(6) because it is covered by 16.6.7p1(12).

[456:44-45 16.6.7p1(2-3)] Delete list items (2) and (3) because they are
not variable definition contexts, and do not apply to nonpointer
variables.

[445:11 16.6.7p1(12)] Append "is not a pointer and" after "dummy

QUESTION:

Do the following declarations conform to the Fortran 2008 standard?

  integer :: A[5,*] = ucobound(a,1) )
  integer :: C[5,ucobound(c,1),*]
  integer :: B[5,*], C[ucobound(b,1),*], D(ucobound(c,1))

ANSWER:

7.1.11p8 says

  "If a specification expression includes a specification inquiry that
   depends on a type parameter or an array bound of an entity specified
   in the same <specification-part>, the type parameter or array bound
   shall be specified in a prior specification of the

This does not establish an interpretation for any of the declarations.

The intent of interpretation F95/000090 was that the third one be

QUESTION:

The Introduction to ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010, page xvi, states
  "A line in the program is permitted to begin
   with a semicolon."

Therefore, do the following 3 lines constitute a valid program.
;PROGRAM bad
PRINT *,'No'
END PROGRAM

ANSWER:

No, the example is not a valid program as it does not satisfy the
syntax rules and constraints.  As stated in 3.3.2.5 and 3.3.3.4, a
semicolon may be used to terminate a statement.  That is not the
case in the example, since there is no statement before the semicolon.

The semicolon does not appear anywhere else in the Fortran syntax and
therefore the example does not conform.

An edit is supplied to the Introduction to clarify the change in
Fortran 2008.

TITLE: Is recursive USE within a submodule permitted?
KEYWORDS: SUBMODULE, USE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 considertion in progress

QUESTION:

Consider
  Module m1
    Real x
  End Module
  Submodule(m1) subm1
    Use m1
  End Submodule

Q1. The module m1 is referenced from within one of its own
    submodules.  Is this standard-conforming?

Note that the "submodule TR", Technical Report 19767 contains, an
edit with the normative requirement:
  "A submodule shall not reference its ancestor module by use
   association, either directly or indirectly."
along with a note which says
  "It is possible for submodules with different ancestor modules to
   access each other's ancestor modules by use association."
It also contains an edit to insert the direct reference prohibition
as a constraint.

However, none of this text appears in ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010.

The Introduction simply comments that submodules are available, but
not that they have been extended beyond the Technical Report that
created them.

Also, consider

  Module m2
    Real, Private :: a
    Real, Protected :: b
    ...
  End Module
  Submodule(m2) subm2
  Contains
    Subroutine s
      Use m2
      Implicit None
      a = 3
      b = 4
    End Subroutine
  End Submodule

In submodule SUBM2, procedure S references M2 by use association.
Use association does not make "A" accessible.

Q2. Is "A" still accessible by host association?

Also, procedure S attempts to assign a value to B, which is accessed
by use association, but has the PROTECTED attribute.  Normally, this
attribute prevents assignment to variables accessed by use
association.

Q3. Is the assignment to "B" standard-conforming?

DISCUSSION:

The requirement appears in the early drafts of Fortran 2008, up to
08-007r1, then it was modified by paper 08-154r1 creating a UTI
(because the modification was broken), and finally the requirement was
completely removed by paper 09-141.

ANSWER:

A1. No, the example was not intended to be conforming.  Permission for
    a submodule to access its ancestor module by use associated was a
    mistake.  An edit is provided to correct this error.

Reinhold Bader
I agree with the answers A1.- A3., except that in A1. "use associated"
should be replaced by "use association".

I disagree with the suggested edit, because it is too broad. Instead, I
suggest the following:

[275:9+] 11.2.3 Submodules,
         "A submodule shall not directly reference its ancestor module
          by use association. If a submodule indirectly references its
          ancestor module by use association, every USE statement in its
          body that causes such a reference shall specify an ONLY option.
          An entity in the <only-list> for that option that is not a
          generic specifier or a renamed operator shall not be specified
          in the submodule's ancestor module. For an entity that is a
          generic specifier or a renamed operator, the referenced
          specific procedure (12.5.5.2) shall not be specified in the
          submodule's ancestor module."

I'm hoping that this not only yields the same answers to the interp, but
also permits compile-time checking of any violations, avoiding the
complaint made by UTI 151 in 09-007. If this turns out to be unfixably
wrong, I'm willing to change my vote to "yes".

The rationale for the above suggestion is as follows:

Imagine that S(A) is a submodule of A (the ancestor) and wants to access
some other module {M} that may be a single module or the beginning of
a use-chain of modules. Prior to the interp, the following dependencies
are permitted, where (u) stands for use and (h) for host association:

     -(u)---->{M}
    /          |
   /          (u)
  /            |
 /             v
S(A) --(h)---> A

With the interp's original edit, the line connecting one (or more) of
the modules in {M} and A causes the program to become non-conforming.
The alternative edit permits the programmer to avoid this with minimal
(if any) overhead.

During the London meeting it was pointed out that the dependency could be
avoided by restructuring the code and moving dependent parts to an
auxiliary module. This is true, but it may involve writing significantly
more code, and often also a submodule of the auxiliary module is needed.
As a result, the global code structure becomes more difficult to
understand.
Furthermore, if A implements "core" concepts that many other modules
might depend on (pushing code to S(A) wouldn't be needed otherwise), it
may well happen that the critical use association M->A gets established
later on in the development process, triggering a potentially large
amount of code restructuring (multiple submodules could be affected in
one fell stroke!). With the alternative edit, the only fallout is that
ONLY clauses must be added in S(A) if they're not already there anyway.

Robert Corbett

Answer A1 states that the example was not intended to be conforming.
Paper 09-141, which is cited in the discussion section, begins

       The prohibition against a submodule accessing or
       referencing its ancestor module by use association
       appears to have been wrong-headed in the first place.
       There appears to be no reason to keep it in any form.

I did not attend the meeting during which paper 09-141 was
approved, but I find it hard to believe that the committee could
have passed that paper without intending to allow such usage.

I see no technical objection to implementing the feature as it is
currently specified.  Paper 09-141 contains remarks to that effect.
The comments Reinhold Bader included in his ballot convinced me
that the feature is useful, and that its removal will put a burden
on users.  If the feature is retained, Q2 and Q3 need answers.
My reading of the Fortran 2008 standard as written is that the
answer to both questions is "yes".

On a minor note, the line

      Note that the "submodule TR", Technical Report 19767 contains, an
      edit

does not conform to the rules of punctuation of American English.
In American English, the comma that terminates an appositive
phrase appears at the end of the phrase, not after the following
verb.  Also, the appearance of quotation marks in that line would
be considered misuse in American English.  It implies that the
term "submodule TR" has an unconventional meaning, which I do
not think is the case here

Erik Kruyt

In the light of F08/0142 the examples are incorrect due to the
augmented C1113. Change the module in the first example to e.g.:
Module m1
  Interface
    Module Subroutine mp1
    End Subroutine
  End Interface
  Real x
End Module

Change the module in the second example to e.g.:
Module m2
  Interface
    Module Subroutine mp2
    End Subroutine
  End Interface
  Real, Private :: a
  Real, Protected :: b
  ...
End Module

Upon reflection, I prefer an answer very similar to Option 1 in 15-208.
A proposed revision is:

{begin revision}

DISCUSSION:

The prohibition against a submodule accessing its ancestor module by use
association appears in the early drafts of Fortran 2008, up to 08-007r1.
Then it was modified by paper 08-154r1 creating a UTI (because the
modification was broken), and finally the requirement was completely
removed by paper 09-141.

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, the example is conforming.  An edit is supplied to add this
    extension to the Introduction, and to add normative text to clause
    11 to make this completely unambiguous.

A2. Yes, A is still accessible by host association.
    Subclause 16.5.1.4 paragraph 2 states
      "If an entity that is accessed by use association has the same
       nongeneric name as a host entity, the host entity is
       inaccessible by that name."
    This does not apply since A is not accessed by use association
    (because it is PRIVATE and therefore not accessible by use
    association, according to the final sentence of the second paragraph
    of 5.3.2).  Therefore, A can still be accessed by host association.
    An edit is provided to revise the referenced sentence to make it
    clear that the entity is accessible by use association but not host
    association, rather than being completely inaccessible.

A3. No, the assignment to B is not conforming because, according to the
    first sentence of the second paragraph of subclause 16.5.1.4, it is
    accessed by use association, and therefore violates constraint C551
    which states
      "A nonpointer object that has the PROTECTED attribute and is
       accessed by use association shall not appear in a variable
       definition context..."
    An edit is provided to add an explanation of this.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[xv] Introduction, p2, first bullet,
  After "Submodules provide ... for modules."
  Insert new sentence
    "A submodule can reference its ancestor module by use
     association."

[100:12] Second paragraph of 5.3.15 PROTECTED attribute, insert this
  text immediately after the word "descendants" (i.e. before the comma)
    "where it is accessed by host association".

[272:23] First paragraph of 11.2.2 The USE statement and use
  association, after
    "A module shall not reference itself, either directly or
     indirectly."
  Append to paragraph
    "A submodule is permitted to reference its ancestor module by
     use association.  "

[273:2+4] Same subclause, NOTE 11.7, append
  "If a submodule accesses a PROTECTED entity from its ancestor module
   by use association, use of that entity is constrained by the
   PROTECTED attribute (5.3.15).".

[443:36-37] Replace the first sentence of the second paragraph of
16.5.1.4 Host Association:

  "If an entity that is accessed by use association has the same
   nongeneric name as a host entity, the host entity is not accessed by
   host association by that name."

{end revision}

The questions are simplified and combined.

I vacillated whether to change the edit for [100:12], viz.
  "where it is accessed by host association"
to
  "where it is not accessed by use association"
to try to make it clearer that construct association is not involved.
Ultimately, I did not change it, because both versions might be
perversely interpreted in that context.  Perhaps some work is needed
here.

The edit for NOTE 11.7 is revised simply to draw attention to 5.3.15 to
refer to it by number instead of repeating material therein.

An edit is provided for [443:36-37] to revise the first sentence of the
second paragraph of 16.5.1.4p2, to make it clear that the entity B is
still accessible, albeit by use association:

        "If an entity that is accessed by use association has the same
        nongeneric name as a host entity, the host entity is not
        accessed by host association by that name."

("... the host entity is inaccessible by that name" could be perversely
interpreted to mean the entity is entirely inaccessible by that name,
i.e., neither by host nor use association.  The problem is the word
"entity.")

This edit would also clarify the situation wherein a host scoping unit
and an internal scoping unit also access the same entity by the same
name by use association (no submodules involved).  I hope this doesn't
need another interp, something like

  module M1
    real, public :: X = 66
  end module M1

  module M2
    use M1, only: X
  contains
    subroutine S1
      use M1, only: X
      implicit NONE
      X = 42
    end subroutine S1
    subroutine S2
      use M1, only: X
      X = 42
    end subroutine S2
    subroutine S3
      call S2
      print *, X
    end subroutine S3
  end module M2

  program P
    use M2, only: S3
    call S3
  end program P

Is the assignment to X in S1 conforming?  Assuming the program conforms,
what is printed by the PRINT statement in subroutine S3, i.e., is the
assignment to X in S2 an assignment to the entity in M1, or is X a local
entity in S2?  According to 16.5.1.4p2, "If an entity that is accessed
by use association has the same nongeneric name as a host entity, the
host entity is inaccessible by that name."  This could be interpreted to
mean that the entity X is not accessible in S1 or S2, neither by use
association nor by host association.

Decision of /INTERP:  Returned F08/0128 to J3 for further work.

TITLE: Is CLASS(type) required to refer to a prior type definition?
KEYWORDS: CLASS, type definition
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Does the CLASS(T) declaration of X in the following conform?

recursive subroutine S ( N, X )
  integer :: N
  class(t), optional :: X
  type :: T
    integer :: Q
  end type T
...

ANSWER:

Although subclause 4.3.1.3 does not require the <derived-type-spec> in a
CLASS specifier to refer to a previously-defined type, it was intended
that CLASS declarations with <derived-type-spec> be parallel to TYPE
declarations.  In a TYPE declaration (4.3.1.2), the specified derived
type is required to be previously defined, or accessed by use or host
association.  Therefore the example ought not to conform.  Edits are
provided to correct this oversight.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[52:6+] 4.3.1.3 CLASS, p1+, insert new paragraph:

"Where a data entity other than a component is declared explicitly using
the CLASS specifier to be of derived type, the specified derived type
shall have been defined previously.  If the data entity is a function
result, the derived type may be specified in the FUNCTION statement
provided the derived type is defined within the body of the function or
is accessible there by use or host association.  If the derived type is
specified in the FUNCTION statement and is defined within the body of
the function, it is as if the function result variable were declared
with that derived type immediately following its <derived-type-def>."

{This is essentially identical to 4.3.1.2p1, except for the replacement
of "TYPE" with "CLASS" and the addition of "other than a component"
(4.3.1.2p1 does not mention components, but it ought to because
otherwise it would contradict C440), but that's a different question.}

TITLE: Does coarray allocation sync even with stopped images?
KEYWORDS: ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, coarray, synchronization, stopped
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Example 1: Consider the trivial program

  Program m206c7e1
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env
    Implicit None
    Real, Allocatable :: x(:)[:]
    Integer :: me[*],i
    Integer stat
    me = This_Image()
    If (Num_Images()<3) Error Stop 'Need at least 3 images'
    If (me==1) Then
      Stop 'Image 1 is now stopping'
    End If
    Allocate(x(100)[*],Stat=stat)
    !
    If (me==2) Print *,'Arrived'                !***A
    !
    If (stat==0) Error Stop 'INCONCEIVABLE'
    If (stat/=Stat_Stopped_Image) Error Stop 'Bad STAT'
    !
    Do i=1,Num_Images()
      If (me[i]/=i) Error Stop 'me not right?'  !***B
    End Do
  End Program

Q1. On images other than image 1, does execution ever reach the
    statement with comment "!***A"?

    6.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, p4 says
      "When an ALLOCATE statement is executed for which an
       allocate-object is a coarray, there is an implicit
       synchronization of all images.  On each image, execution of the
       segment (8.5.2) following the statement is delayed until all
       other images have executed the same statement the same number
       of times."

    The second sentence seems to say that execution on images>1 is
    delayed forever, since image 1 will never execute that ALLOCATE
    statement.

Example 2: Consider the program

  Program m206c7e2
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env
    Implicit None
    Real(real32), Allocatable :: x(:,:,:,:)[:],y(:,:,:,:)
    Integer :: me[*],i
    Integer stat
    me = This_Image()
    If (Num_Images()<3) Error Stop 'Need at least 3 images'
    If (me==1) Then
      Allocate(y(1000,1000,1000,1000))                !***C
    End If
    Allocate(x(1000,1000,1000,1000)[*],Stat=stat)     !***D
    !
    If (me==1 .And. stat==0) Error Stop 'Inconceivable!'
    !
    If (stat==0) Print *, 'ALLOCATE ok on image', me  !***E
    !
    Do i=1,Num_Images()
      If (me[i]/=i) Error Stop 'me not right?'        !***F
    End Do
  End Program

For purposes of discussion, let us assume that each image has 6
Terabytes of memory available to it for dynamic allocation.

The ALLOCATE statement commented "!***C" will allocate 4 terabytes of
memory on image 1.  Execution of the ALLOCATE statement commented
"!***D" will attempt to allocate 4 terabytes on each image; this will
fail on image 1 as there is insufficient memory available, but could
succeed on other images.

Q2. Is the success of an ALLOCATE statement the same on every image,
    or may it fail on some images and succeed on others?  That is,
    might the statement commented "!***E" execute the PRINT on some
    images (but not all).

Q2 continuation:
    If the answer is that the ALLOCATE must either succeed or fail on
    all images, can the STAT= value differ by image (for example,
    might a processor return a different STAT= code for "no memory on
    this image" and "no memory on some other image").

Example 3: Consider the program

  Program m206c7e3
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env
    Implicit None
    Real, Allocatable :: x(:)[:]
    Integer :: me[*],i
    Integer stat
    me = This_Image()
    If (Num_Images()<3) Error Stop 'Need at least 3 images'
    If (me==1) Then
      Call do_something_that_takes_a_very_long_time
    End If
    Allocate(x(100)[*],Stat=stat)               !***G
    !
    If (stat==0) Error Stop 'INCONCEIVABLE'
    !
    Do i=1,Num_Images()
      If (me[i]/=i) Error Stop 'me not right?'  !***H
    End Do

Let us imagine that the processor operates some form of "timeout"
mechanism, for example, if an image fails to reach a synchronization
point within an hour of the first image reaching that statement, an
error is returned.  (If the slow image subsequently reaches that
statement, one might conjecture that it will also get an error, but
probably STAT_YOU_ARE_TOO_SLOW rather than STAT_TIMEOUT).

In the example above, let us assume that the ALLOCATE statement
commented "!***G" fails, e.g. with a timeout error as we imagined above.

Q3. After resolution of question 1, which images are synchronized
    after execution of an ALLOCATE statement that fails?  That is,
    is execution of the statements commented "!***B" (in Q1), "!***F"
    (in Q2) and "!***H" (above) permitted, or are they impermissible
    references to variables in unordered segments?

    In the case of "!***B", one might conjecture that all the
    non-stopped images are synchronized.

    In the case of "!***F" the text of the standard appears to require
    that image 1 has to wait for all the other images, but it might
    equally be conjectured that that is a mistake and that since it
    knows straightaway that it cannot satisfy the memory allocation it
    should be allowed to return straightaway without synchronizing,
    i.e. the "!***F" is not allowed.

    In the case of "!***H", image 1 has still not even reached the
    ALLOCATE statement (after an hour of the others waiting), so it
    would seem that it is impossible for it to have synchronized as
    required by the standard, and therefore that (for i==1 at least)
    the execution of "!***H" is not allowed.

Q4. When allocation of a coarray is involved, and an error occurs
    (e.g. as in the examples above, plus other cases), under what
    situations does the coarray in question become allocated?

    In particular, can a coarray be allocated on some images but not
    others?  If the answer is that the coarray never becomes
    allocated, that means that in the case of a stopped image, the
    remaining images cannot allocate any coarray.

Q5. Do the answers to Q1-Q4 also apply to DEALLOCATE statements?

ANSWER:

A1. In the case of stopped images, the requirement in 6.7.1.2 was only
    intended to apply to the non-stopped images.  An edit is provided
    to correct this mistake.

A2. Allocation of a coarray was intended only to succeed if it
    succeeds on all images.  An edit is provided to add this missing
    requirement.
(A2 continuation)
    There was not intended to be any requirement that a nonzero STAT=
    value be the same on each image.  No edit is provided to add such
    a requirement.

A3. After execution of an ALLOCATE statement that returns an error
    other than STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, there was not intended to be any
    requirement for synchronization.  An edit is provided to correct
    this mistake.

A4. The coarray can become allocated on an image if and only if it can
    become allocated on all other images.  An edit is provided to add
    this requirement.  The consequence in the case of a stopped image
    is indeed that no image can subsequently change the allocation
    status of any coarray.

A5. Yes, the answers also apply to DEALLOCATE statements.
    Corresponding edits are supplied.

TITLE: Are the changes to C_LOC in the 2010 revision intentional?
KEYWORDS: C_LOC, interoperability
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

The description of C_LOC in the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING permits
noninteroperable array arguments that are contiguous, provided the
type and kind are interoperable.  This was not permitted by the
previous revision of ISO/IEC 1539-1, which required all type
parameters to be interoperable (and only exempted allocatable arrays
from the "interoperable variable" requirement); however this is not
listed in the Introduction as a change.

For example, each of the following is apparently permitted as
arguments to C_LOC by the requirements in Fortran 2008 but not in
Fortran 2003:
  CHARACTER(13,C_char),TARGET :: x(100)
  CHARACTER(14,C_char),TARGET :: y
  REAL(C_float),CONTIGUOUS :: dummy1(:)
  INTEGER(C_int),CONTIGUOUS,POINTER :: z(:)
(the CONTIGUOUS attribute does not exist in Fortran 2003).
and also
  REAL(C_float) :: dummy2(:)
  INTEGER(C_int),POINTER :: z2(:)
when dummy1 is argument-associated with a contiguous array, and z2 is
pointer-associated with a contiguous array.

Was this change intended?

ANSWER:

Yes, this change was intentional.  An edit is provided to add this to
the Introduction.

     the argument of the function C_LOC in the intrinsic module

TITLE: Can a procedure pointer be declared with an interface block?
KEYWORDS: procedure pointer, interface block
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider the program

  PROGRAM c11
    INTERFACE
      REAL FUNCTION F()
      END FUNCTION
    END INTERFACE
    POINTER F
    EXTERNAL G
    F => G
    PRINT *,F()
  END PROGRAM
  REAL FUNCTION G()
    G = 206
  END FUNCTION

According to 12.4.3.2 paragraph 5, F is an external procedure (and
seems to be missing).  There is no mention of the possibility of a
procedure pointer in the subclause on interface blocks.

Is this intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, this is intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to correct the mistake in 12.4.3.2.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[281:26] In 12.4.3.2 Interface block, paragraph 5,
  After "specific interface for an external procedure"
  change "or a dummy procedure"
  to     ", dummy procedure, or procedure pointer".
{Add procedure pointer for the list of things this can declare.}

[281:25-28] Same paragraph,
  After "interface body, the procedure is a dummy procedure"
  change "; otherwise"
  to ".  If the procedure has the POINTER attribute, it is a
      procedure pointer.  If it is not a dummy procedure or
      procedure pointer".
{Correct how we establish what it is.}

This makes that whole paragraph read:

  An interface body in a generic or specific interface block specifies
  the EXTERNAL attribute and an explicit specific interface for an
  external procedure, dummy procedure, or procedure pointer.  If the
  name of the declared procedure is that of a dummy argument in the
  subprogram containing the interface body, the procedure is a dummy
  procedure.  If the procedure has the POINTER attribute, it is a
  procedure pointer.  If it is not a dummy procedure or
  procedure pointer, it is an external procedure.

{Note careful wording to avoid saying that a dummy procedure is not a
 procedure pointer, since a dummy procedure pointer is indeed both a
 dummy procedure and a procedure pointer.}

KEYWORDS: OPTIONAL, ALLOCATABLE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum

QUESTION:

Does the following program conform to the 2008 standard?

program P
  integer, allocatable :: I(:)
  call s ( i )
contains
  subroutine S ( A )
    integer, intent(in), optional :: A(:)

end program P

Subclause 6.7.1.3 says, concerning an unallocated allocatable variable,
"It shall not be supplied as an actual argument corresponding to a
nonallocatable dummy argument, except to certain intrinsic inquiry
functions."

On the other hand, subclause 12.5.2.12 says a dummy argument "is not
present if the dummy argument ... does not have the ALLOCATABLE ...
attribute, and corresponds to an actual argument that ... has the
ALLOCATABLE attribute and is not allocated...."

The intent was that the program conforms, and prints "A is not present",

TITLE: Vector subscripted actual makes VALUE dummy undefinable?
KEYWORDS: VALUE, definable, vector subscript
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

12.5.2.4p18 [295:3-4] says
  "If the actual argument is an array section having a vector
   subscript, the dummy argument is not definable and shall not have
   the ASYNCHRONOUS, INTENT (OUT), INTENT (INOUT), or VOLATILE
   attributes."

This would seem to be a strange requirement when the dummy argument
has the VALUE attribute (and so is not argument-associated with the
actual argument anyway).

Consider

  program P1
    real :: X(3)
    call S1 ( X ( [ 1, 3, 2 ] ) )
  contains
    subroutine S1 ( A )
      real, value :: A(:)
      A = 3
      print *, A
    end subroutine
  end program

and

  PROGRAM p2
    REAL :: x(3) = [ 10,20,30 ]
    OPEN(10,ASYNCHRONOUS='YES',FORM='UNFORMATTED')
    CALL s2( x( [ 1,2,2,1 ] ) )
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE s2(a2)
      REAL,VALUE,ASYNCHRONOUS :: a2(:)
      READ(10,ASYNCHRONOUS='YES') a2
      PRINT *,'reading...'
      WAIT(10)
      PRINT *,a2
    END SUBROUTINE
  END PROGRAM

Are these two programs standard-conforming?  In particular, is the
assignment to A permitted in S1, and is the dummy argument a2
permitted to have the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute in s2.

ANSWER:

These two programs were intended to be standard-conforming.  Subclause
12.5.2.3 states that a VALUE dummy argument is associated with a
definable data object and not with the actual argument.  An edit is
supplied to correct this mistake.

TITLE: Argument correspondence with VALUE and ASYNCHRONOUS
KEYWORDS: VALUE, ASYNCHRONOUS, coindexed, contiguous
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider the following three programs and discussions:

program P1
  real, asynchronous :: X[*]
  call S1 ( X [ 1 ] )
contains
  subroutine S1 ( A )
    real, value, asynchronous :: A
    a = 3
  end subroutine S1
end program P1

Program P1 appears to violate C1238 which says
  "An actual argument that is a coindexed object with the ASYNCHRONOUS
   or VOLATILE attribute shall not correspond to a dummy argument that
   has either the ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE attribute."
but the dummy argument is not associated with the actual argument so
it is unclear why that should be the case.

program P2
  real, asynchronous :: X(3)
  call S2A ( X )
contains
  subroutine S2A ( A )
    real, asynchronous :: A(:)
    call S2B ( A(1:3) )
  end subroutine S2A
  subroutine S2B ( A )
    real, value, asynchronous, contiguous :: A(:)
    a = 3
  end subroutine S2B
end program P2

This appears to violate C1239 which says
  "If an actual argument is a nonpointer array that has the
   ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE attribute but is not simply contiguous
   (6.5.4), and the corresponding dummy argument has either the
   VOLATILE or ASYNCHRONOUS attribute, that dummy argument shall be an
   assumed-shape array that does not have the CONTIGUOUS attribute."
but again, it is unclear why that should matter for a VALUE dummy
argument.

program P3
  real, target :: X(3)
  real, pointer, asynchronous :: Y(:)
  y => x
  call S3 ( y )
contains
  subroutine S3 ( A )
    real, value, asynchronous, contiguous :: A(:)
    a = 3
  end subroutine S3
end program P3

This program appears to violate C1240 which says
  "If an actual argument is an array pointer that has the ASYNCHRONOUS
   or VOLATILE attribute but does not have the CONTIGUOUS attribute,
   and the corresponding dummy argument has either the VOLATILE or
   ASYNCHRONOUS attribute, that dummy argument shall be an array
   pointer or an assumed-shape array that does not have the CONTIGUOUS
   attribute."
but it is unclear why this should matter for a VALUE dummy argument.

Are those programs intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, all those programs were intended to be standard-conforming.
There is no need for those constraints to apply to dummy arguments
with the VALUE attribute, because a VALUE dummy argument is not
associated with the actual argument but with an anonymous definable
data object.

Edits are supplied to correct the mistakes in the constraints.

TITLE: Result of TRANSFER when MOLD is an array with element size zero
KEYWORDS: TRANSFER, zero-sized scalar
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider the following examples:

Example 1:
  CHARACTER(0),PARAMETER :: nothing1(100) = ''
  PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(111014,nothing1))

Example 2:
   TYPE empty
   END TYPE
   ! When the physical representation of empty() has size zero;
   ! this is not required but does seem to be permitted.
   TYPE(empty),PARAMETER :: nothing2(1) = empty()
   PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(111014,nothing2))

Example 3:
   TYPE nonempty
     REAL c(0)
   END TYPE
   TYPE(nonempty),PARAMETER :: nothing3(0) = nonempty(0.0)
   PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(111014,nothing3))

According to Fortran 2008, 13.7.168, the result of TRANSFER in this
case is an array of rank one whose
  "size is as small as possible such that its physical representation
   is not shorter than that of SOURCE".
However, the size of a zero-length character is zero and the size of
the above derived types may be zero, no matter how many array elements
there are, so these examples do not seem to be well-defined.

Also consider the following examples, with nothing1 defined as in
example 1.

Example 4:
  CHARACTER(0) :: source1 = ''
  PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(source1,nothing1))

Example 5:
  CHARACTER(999) :: source2(0) = REPEAT('!',999)
  PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(source2,nothing1))

In these cases the physical representation of an element of MOLD has
size zero, but then so does the physical representation of the SOURCE
argument.  According to the quoted text, that would mean that TRANSFER
should return a zero-sized array, i.e. the examples will print zero.

Example 6:
  CHARACTER(*),INTENT(IN) :: maybe_nothing(:) ! A dummy argument.
  CHARACTER(999) :: source3(0) = REPEAT('!',999)
  PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(source3,maybe_nothing))

Example 7:
  CHARACTER(*),INTENT(IN) :: maybe_nothing(:) ! A dummy argument.
  CHARACTER(999) :: source4(10) = REPEAT('!',999)
  PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(source4,maybe_nothing))

In these examples, the physical representation of MOLD is not known at
compile time, but depends on the length of the dummy argument.  Using
the analysis above, example 6 would seem to be conforming (and print
zero), while example 7 would seem to be conforming if and only if the
length of maybe_nothing is nonzero at execution time.

Which of the examples are conforming?  If any of examples 1-3 are
conforming, what value is printed?

ANSWER:

Example 1 is not conforming, and if the derived types have size zero
in examples 2 and 3, those examples are also not conforming, as no
interpretation is established for them.  An edit is provided to
clarify that they are not valid.

Examples 4-6 are conforming, and the value zero is printed.

Example 7 is conforming if and only if the length of maybe_nothing is
not zero.  The same edit clarifies that the zero-length case is not
valid.

DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider the following code:

    module mod_a
      implicit none
      type, abstract :: t_a
       contains
         procedure(p_a), deferred :: p
      end type t_a
      abstract interface
         subroutine p_a(this, q)
           import :: t_a
           class(t_a), intent(inout) :: this
           class(*), intent(in) :: q
         end subroutine
      end interface
    end module mod_a

    submodule(mod_a) imp_p_a
      type, extends(t_a) :: t_imp
         real :: b
      contains
         procedure :: p => psub ! (A)
      end type t_imp
    contains
      subroutine psub(this, q)
        class(t_imp), intent(inout) :: this
        class(*), intent(in) :: q
        ... ! don't care
      end subroutine psub
    end submodule imp_p_a

Constraint C465 in 10-007r1 reads

"C465 (R448) The procedure-name shall be the name of an accessible
      module procedure or an external procedure that has an explicit
      interface."

Therefore it would appear that statement (A) above is not standard
conforming since PSUB is not the name of a module procedure.

Q1. Is this correct?

If so, extension of a derived type with a deferred type-bound
procedure cannot be done within the specification part of a submodule.

Q2. Was this intended?

ANSWER:

A1. No, this is not correct.  A module procedure is a procedure that
    is defined by a module subprogram (1.3.112.4).  A submodule
    program unit contains a module-subprogram-part (R1116), and this
    contains a (possibly-empty) sequence of module-subprogram's
    (R1107).  Therefore, PSUB is defined by a module subprogram and
    is therefore a module procedure.  Therefore, the statement that
    is commented "(A)" is standard-conforming.

    Type(t) x[*]
    Allocate ( Character(42) :: x%c )

    Sync All
    If (This_Image()==1) x[2]%c = 'stuff'
  End Program

Is the assignment permitted?

ANSWER:

A1. This is not permitted, as it violates the requirement in 7.2.1.2
    Intrinsic assignment statement, paragraph 2, which states that if
    the variable (in an intrinsic assignment statement) is coindexed,
    its deferred length type parameters shall be the same as the
    corresponding type parameters of the expression.

    There is a grammatical error in this requirement; an edit is
    supplied to correct the grammatical error.

A2. This was intended to be permitted, but was inadvertently caught in
    the prohibition that was intended to apply only to allocatable
    variables.  An edit is supplied to correct this error.

TITLE: Can a statement function have a variable-length PDT result?
KEYWORDS: Statement function, parameterized derived type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider

    MODULE m207c006
      TYPE string(n)
        INTEGER,LEN :: n
        CHARACTER(n) :: v
      END TYPE
    END MODULE
    PROGRAM test
      USE m207c006
      CALL s(3)
      CALL s(7)
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s(n)
        TYPE(string(n)) sf
        TYPE(string(n)) var(3)
        sf(nn) = var(nn)
        var(1) = string(n)('123456789')
        var(2) = string(n)('abcdefgh')
        PRINT *,sf(1),sf(2)
      END SUBROUTINE
    END PROGRAM

If this is conforming, it would appear that the output ought to be
  123abc
  1234567abcdefg

However, for the following reasons, perhaps this is not intended to be
conforming.

(1) A statement function of type character is required to have a
    constant length type parameter.  There is no such requirement on a
    statement function of parameterized derived type.  This seems
    inconsistent, since one can wrap a variable-length character
    in a parameterized derived type.

(2) A statement function is not permitted to invoke a nonintrinsic
    function that requires an explicit interface (and having a PDT
    result requires an explicit interface), nor is it permitted to
    contain a structure constructor.  This would seem to render such a
    statement function almost completely useless, since all it can do
    is to choose between PDT constants or variables, or use an
    intrinsic function such as TRANSFER to construct the result.

(3) Statement functions were declared to be obsolescent long before
    the addition of parameterized derived types to the standard.  It
    has been general policy not to "improve" obsolescent features.
    This would seem to indicate that statement functions were not
    intended to be capable of having parameterized derived type in the
    first place.

Q1. Are statement functions of parameterized derived type intended to
    be conforming?

Q2. If so, are statement functions of parameterized derived type with
    nonconstant length type parameters intended to be conforming?

Q3. If so, is the expected output from the example program above as
    described?

ANSWER:

A1. No, statement functions were not intended to be permitted to be of
    parameterized derived type.  The exception for statement functions
    from the explicit interface requirements was overlooked.  An edit
    is provided to prohibit these.

TITLE: Can initial-data-target be coindexed?
KEYWORDS: initialization, pointers, coarrays
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

In pointer assignment, the standard is quite clear that data-target
cannot be coindexed:

C725 (R737) A data-target shall not be a coindexed object.

And there are a couple of notes related to this:

NOTE 7.45
A data pointer and its target are always on the same image. A coarray
may be of a derived type with pointer or allocatable subcomponents. For
example, if PTR is a pointer component, Z[P]%PTR is a reference to the
target of component PTR of Z on image P. This target is on image P and
its association with Z[P]%PTR must have been established by the
execution of an ALLOCATE statement or a pointer assignment on image P.

NOTE 7.46
A pointer assignment statement is not permitted to involve a coindexed
pointer or target, see C723 and C725. This prevents a pointer
assignment statement from associating a pointer with a target on
another image. If such an association would otherwise be implied, the
association status of the pointer becomes undefined. For example, a
derived-type intrinsic assignment where the variable and expr are on
different images and the variable has an ultimate pointer component.

Fortran 2008 added the ability to specify an initial-data-target in
pointer initialization:

R505 initialization is = constant-expr
                    or => null-init
                    or => initial-data-target
R506 null-init      is function-reference

C510 (R503) If => appears in initialization, the entity shall have the
POINTER attribute. If = appears in initialization, the entity shall not
have the POINTER attribute.

C511 (R503) If initial-data-target appears, object-name shall be
data-pointer-initialization compatible with it (4.5.4.6).

Initial-data-target is defined in 4.5.4.6 and the only relevant
constraint for it is:

C461 (R443) The designator shall designate a nonallocatable variable
that has the TARGET and SAVE attributes and does not have a vector
subscript. Every subscript, section subscript, substring starting
point, and substring ending point in designator shall be a constant
expression.

The definition of "data-pointer-initialization compatible" is:

"A pointer variable or component is data-pointer-initialization
compatible with a target if the pointer is type compatible with the
target, they have the same rank, all nondeferred type parameters of the
pointer have the same values as the corresponding type parameters of
the target, and the target is contiguous if the pointer has the
CONTIGUOUS attribute."

Given this, is initializing a pointer to a coindexed object permitted?

For example:

program test
integer, save, target :: C[*]
integer, pointer :: P => C[3] ! Permitted?
end

While ordinary pointer assignment to a coindexed object is prohibited
by C725, there is no corresponding constraint prohibiting such
association by way of data pointer initialization.

Note that 16.5.2.5p1(2) says that pointer-assigning to a target on a
different image causes the pointer to become undefined. Since the
initialization occurs on all images, and it's not possible to restrict
the target to only the same image, the effect would be to make a
program that does this nonconforming.

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be permitted. A clarifying edit is
provided.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[70:3] 4.5.4.6

In the first sentence of C461, insert ", noncoindexed" after
"nonallocatable" so that the sentence reads:

C461 (R443) The designator shall designate a nonallocatable,
noncoindexed variable that has the TARGET and SAVE attributes and
does not have a vector subscript.

TITLE: Does intrinsic assignment copy inherited components twice?
KEYWORDS: Intrinsic assignment, Type extension
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

  Type base
    Integer a
  End Type
  Type,Extends(base) :: ext
    Real b
  End Type
  ...
  Type(ext) x,y
  ...
  x = y

According to 7.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, p13,

  "An intrinsic assignment where the variable is of derived type is
   performed as if each component of the variable were assigned from
   the corresponding component of <expr>"

This would seem to indicate that the above assignment "x = y" is
interpreted as the following (in unspecified order):

  x%a = y%a
  x%b = y%b
  x%base = y%base

and the assignment to x%base is treated as if it were

  x%base%a = y%base%a

thus assigning to x%a twice, which does not seem to make sense.  If a
type is extended more than once, there can be a plethora of ancestor
components inheritance-associated with a component, resulting in that
component being assigned many times.

Q1. Are these per-component assignment semantics intended to apply to
    ancestor components (and thus produce multiple assignments for
    inherited components).

It is particularly problematic if the components have type-bound
defined assignment, for example consider the program

  Module damod
    Type datype
    Contains
      Procedure asgnda
      Generic :: Assignment(=) => asgnda
    End Type
  Contains
    Subroutine asgnda(a,b)
      Class(datype),Intent(Out) :: a
      Class(datype),Intent(In) :: b
      Print *,'Hello asgnda'
    End Subroutine
  End Module
  Module types
    Use damod
    Type base
      Type(datype) c
    End Type
    Type,Extends(base) :: ext
    End Type
  End Module
  Program test
    Use types
    Type(ext) :: x = ext(datype()), y
    y = x

Q2. Does this program print "Hello asgnda" once or twice?

ANSWER:

A1. This sentence was not intended to apply to ancestor components; an
    edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

A2. The program should print "Hello asgnda" only once.

[I] expect defind assignment to work like finalization on the parent
of an extended type [15-007r2 4.5.6.2 78:19] - if the parent has
defined assignment, it is called on the parent and not on its components.

From: Tom Clune

Attached below is a motivating example of my objection to the interp
we discussed on Tuesday. (Paper 218 I think.)

I also have a few additional arguments to bolster my case:

1) If I understand correctly, the semantics of finalization work on
   the base object, not on the components of the base object.  In
   15-007r2.pdf  4.5.6.2 The finalization process (78:19), we have:  

    "If the entity is of extended type and the parent type is
     finalizable, the parent component is finalized."

   The proposed interp seems to run contrary to this treatment of the
   base as a coherent entity.

2) Not that it really matters, but C++ implicit copy/assignment semantics
   also use the copy/assignment operator for the base object, not its
   components.

3) Just to reiterate my point on Tuesday.   The proposed interp in 218
   adds considerable burden to implementors of type extensions.   If a
   base type overrides default assignment, then the type extension
   almost certainly must as well, or risk ruining some invariant property
   that the base otherwise preserves.  Further, this burden propagates
   down the inheritance hierarchy.  Perhaps on some occasions, the
   implementor may find that default assignment is actually ok, but it
   would require looking "inside" the base type implementation.  (And I
   cannot construct a plausible motivating example of this situation,
   though I've also not tried very hard.)

! The following is an example of how many users intuitively expect
! instrinsic assignment of an extended type when the ancestor type
! has a derived assignment.  

! Here, we desire _deep_ copy semantics for type base, which happens to
! use POINTER components.  In this instance, an allocatable component
! could fix the issue, but consider the case of a base type which
! implements a binary tree, and pointer components were thus much harder
! to avoid.


module the_classes

   type :: base
      integer, pointer :: ptr => null()
   contains
      procedure :: equals
      generic :: assignment(=) => equals
   end type base

   ! We now extend the base class in a relatively trivial manner.
   ! There needs to be at least one new component or the casual
   ! observer might think that the assignment defined below
   ! could just use CLASS for the RHS argument and allow inheritance
   ! to do the "right thing" (TM).  Often we would like the new components
   ! defined in the extension to be copied as well, and that
   ! approach becomes inadequate.
   type, extends(base) :: child
      character(len=:), allocatable :: name
   end type child

contains

   subroutine equals(a, b)
      class (base), intent(out) :: a
      type (base), intent(in) :: b

      allocate(a%ptr)
      a%ptr = b%ptr
      
   end subroutine equals

end module the_classes


program main
   use the_classes
   implicit none

   type (child)  :: c1, c2

   allocate(c1%ptr)
   c1%ptr = 1
   c1%name = 'Alice'

   c2 = c1
   ! Because we want "deep copy" semantics, we want to be able to change
   ! c1%ptr without impacting c2

   c1%ptr = 2

   print*,'Results:'
   print '(10x,a10,1x,i1)', c2%name, c2%ptr

According to 7.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, an assignment
statement is an intrinsic assignment statement if (and only if) it
is not a defined assignment statement.  According to 7.2.1.4 Defined
assignment statement, a defined assignment statement needs to have a
subroutine that defines the assignment "x1 = x2".  For elemental
subroutines (item (5)(b)), that is true only if
  "x1 and x2 are conformable"
which when x1 and x2 are both arrays, means "has the same shape".
For the example above, in the assignment marked (A), x and y will be
conformable (as both n and n2 are equal to 10), making that a defined
assignment, thus the PRINT statement after it would print
 -1.0 -2.0 -3.0 -4.0 -5.0 -6.0 -7.0 -8.0 -9.0 -10.0
while in the assignment statement marked (B), y and z will not be
conformable (n2 being 10 and m being 13), making it an intrinsic
assignment.  In this case, because Y is allocatable it will be
reallocated, and so the output from the second PRINT statement would
be
 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0

However, this would seem to violate the fundamental principle that
generic references are resolvable at compile time.  It would also
seem to be nearly useless since if the variable is not allocatable
the shapes are required to conform anyway.

Is this feature intended to work like this?

ANSWER:

No, this was a mistake.  Edits are provided to remove the runtime
generic resolution.

After the edits:
  1) The assignment A is defined assignment and is conforming (from 
     first edit).

  2) The assignment B is defined assignment but is not standard conforming,
     since the shapes differ (from second edit).
 
  3) For a defined assignment statement, auto-reallocation of 
     allocatables does not occur, as that is only done by an intrinsic 
     assignment statement.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[24:11+] 1.6.2 Fortran 2003 compatibility, insert new incompatibility
  "Fortran 2003 interpreted assignment to an allocatable variable
   from a nonconformable array as intrinsic assignment, even when an
   elemental defined assignment was in scope; this part of ISO/IEC
   1539 does not permit assignment from a nonconformable array in
   this context.".
{The unintended extension is weird and violates our own principles,
 but is not in itself contradictory or ambiguous so this is an
 incompatibility.}

Item (3) in the list in constraint C1283 in subclause 12.7 prohibits
an object that is accessed by host or use association (and other
categories) to be the <expr> in a structure constructor that
corresponds to a component that has the POINTER attribute.  It is
silent concerning type constructors for types that have potential
subobject components with the POINTER attribute.

Is the statement labeled 1 permitted?  If so, was that intended?

ANSWER:

The statement labeled 1 was inadvertently allowed because V1
corresponds to a component of the structure constructor for type T2
that does not have the POINTER attribute.

Subclause 9.12, paragraph 7, prohibits the variable specified in an
IOSTAT=, IOMSG=, or SIZE= specifier from being associated with any
entity in a <namelist-group-object-list>.  Subclause 9.12, paragraph
7, prohibits a subscript value from being affected by data transfer.
Both paragraphs are silent concerning the ID= specifier.

Which of statements labeled 1-4 permitted?

ANSWER:

Statements 1 and 2 were intended to be permitted.  IOSTAT= and ID=
variables should be allowed to be in a namelist group as long as it is
not the NML= specifier used by the I/O statement in which they appear.

Statements 3 and 4 were not intended to be permitted.  The variable
