Subject: Interp. regarding deallocating objects
Date: 2010 June 16

NUMBER: F08/0010
TITLE: deallocating objects that are associated with other objects
KEYWORDS: DEALLOCATE associated
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Q1:

Consider the program

      SUBROUTINE SUBR(A)
        REAL A(*)
        REAL, POINTER, DIMENSION(:) :: P, Q
        COMMON P, Q
        DEALLOCATE (P)
      END

      PROGRAM MAIN
        REAL, POINTER, DIMENSION(:) :: P, Q
        COMMON P, Q
        ALLOCATE(P(100))
        P = 1.0
        Q => P
        CALL SUBR(Q(1:100:11)
      END

The subroutine SUBR deallocates the object containing the subobject
associated with the nonpointer argument A.  Is it intended that a
pointer may be deallocated while its target is associated with a
nonpointer entity?

Q2:

Consider the code fragment

        ASSOCIATE (X=>A(3))
        DEALLOCATE (A)
        X = 0.0

where A is an allocatable array that is allocated at the start of the
code fragment.  Is it intended that an allocatable variable may be
deallocated while it is associated with an associate name?

ANSWER:

A1: No, the deallocation is not intended to be permitted.  An edit is
    supplied to correct this oversight.

A2: No, the deallocation is not intended to be permitted.  An edit is
    supplied to correct this oversight.

EDITS to 10-007:

[6.7.3.2p1, 130:23] Add the following sentence to the end of the
  paragraph
  "An allocatable variable shall not be deallocated if it or any
   subobject of it is argument associated with a dummy argument
   or construct associated with an associate name."

[6.7.3.3p1, 131:27] Add the following sentence to the end of the
  paragraph
  "A pointer shall not be deallocated if its target or any subobject
   thereof is argument associated with a dummy argument or construct
   associated with an associate name."
