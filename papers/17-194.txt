Subject: GET_TEAM Note

Discussion:
-----------

GET_TEAM is unique among ordinary intrinsics in subclause 16.9 in that
its return type, TEAM_TYPE defined in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, is not one of
the intrinsic types, and is not the same as the type of any
non-optional dummy argument. Hence, it is possible to have a reference
to GET_TEAM in a program unit that has no other usage of type
TEAM_TYPE. However, ordinary intrinsic functions, including GET_TEAM
automatically have explicit interfaces. Which leads to the situation
of an explicit interface having a result type that is not defined
unless it is accessible from ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  A NOTE is proposed to
clarify this for programmers.



Edits to WG5/N2137:
-------------------

[390:1+] At the end of 16.9.85 GET_TEAM, add a Note:

"NOTE 16.16a

 Because the result type for GET_TEAM is TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic
 module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, a program unit that includes a reference to
 GET_TEAM should also have access to the definition of TEAM_TYPE from
 ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, even if there is no explicit use of TEAM_TYPE in the
 program unit."
