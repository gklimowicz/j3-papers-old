                                                            J3/09-102
To: J3
From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Editor's report for production of 09-007
Date: 2009 January 09

1. Introduction
---------------

This document describes briefly the changes made to the draft standard in
producing 09-007, and details the editorial changes made to the passed
papers and any technical problems encountered.


2. The papers
-------------

a. Editorial and technical corrections from 08-019r1 (meeting 186); this
   combines the approved corrections from various passed papers at meetings
   184 and 185 (see 08-019r1 for further details).

b. Changes approved by WG5 resolution as listed in N1760; this includes the
   papers
     08-147r1   08-290r2
     08-154r1   08-296r2
     08-158     08-297r1
     08-162r2   08-299r1
     08-165r1   08-300
     08-166r1   08-301r1
     08-178     08-303
     08-181     08-304
     08-214     08-308r1
     08-281r2   08-309

c. Miscellaneous other J3 papers without WG5 authorisation; this includes
     08-275r1
     08-276
     08-277r2
     08-287r2
     08-289r1
     08-291r2
     08-292r1
     08-298r2
   On examination, the editor believes these are all corrections or
   editorial changes rather than changes to the technical content.

d. Unauthorised technical changes.
     08-295
   Actually, WG5 did approve this, but it was not put into N1760.
   Can I complain repeatedly about the quality of N1760?

e. Format change (moving subclauses around) for ISO conformance, 08-306.
   Again, we discussed this and straw-voted it, but it didn't reach the
   resolutions.

f. Purely editorial papers
     08-278
     08-285
     08-286
     09-101 (this should have been submitted at meeting 186).


3. Other changes
----------------

GLOBAL:
  Changed from A4 to Letter, turned line numbering back on.

Fixed captioning of Table 2.1 when it went across a page boundary.

Fixed indexing of "expression~initilization" on p149.

Deleted spurious left brace at the end of CHAR (p335).

Added reference to the "Vector subscript" subclause from the defined term.

Fixed many spurious paragraph numbers.

Fixed wording in 10.7.2.1 item (5) and 10.7.2.3.2p7.

Added full stop to 10.7.5.2.2p6.


4. Comments on the edits
------------------------

These are in numerical order by paper number.

08-019r1:

  - Indexed new defined term "descendant" throughout the document.

  - [85:5.1p3+] On closer examination, this is out of place and
                ungrammatical.  Deferred for later work.

  - [94:5.3.8.6] Indexed "named constant" throughout the document,
                 not just here (which is what the edit said).

  - [109:5.7.1.1, C583] Added indefinite article.

  - [112:5.7.2.1, C597] Added indefinite article.

  - [124:C626] Also deleted redundant constraint C644 which said exactly
    the same thing for <allocate-object> (using the same bad wording) for
    the deallocate statement.  However, C626 already affects the
    deallocate statement because it is applied to R631 <allocate-object>
    so fixes it wherever that is used.

  - [171:8.1.4 C806] Put "statement function" in obsolescent font.

  - [175:8.1.7.1p2] Also replaced in paragraph 5.

  - [277:12.4.3.2p7] Instructions incorrect - the words that were said to
                     be at the end of the sentence were not.  I moved them
                     to the new place anyway.

  - [300:12.5.5.3p2] Added "is" i.e. "and is not ..." for "and not".

  - [300:12.5.5.3p5] Omitted "the name of", because it was incorrect.

  - [300:12.5.5.3p5+] Changed "by that name" to "by the name".
                      (See other text around here to see why.)

  - [303:12.6.2.2] Indexed "result variable" throughout the document,
                   not just here.

  - [335:13.7.34p3] Inserted the space, not a comma; this is a nested
                    two-element list, not a 3-element list.

  - [459:A.2] Changed reference "(6.6.3.1)" to "(6.6.3)" which is the
              correct reference (that being "DEALLOCATE statement" whereas
              the other was just "Syntax").
              Broke into two items and reworded - objects are not
              deallocated by "the occurrence of an event".

08-147r1:

  - [99: 5.3.18p1 C556] Merged with edit from 08-019r1 (08-265r1).

08-154r1:

 - [268:11.2.2p1] Cue repeat rant about giving the right instructions,
   not just "replace whole sentence".
   Anyway, for consistency with the preceding sentence I didn't delete the
   word "either".  However, what's with the "indirect" access of an entity?
   This is hopelessly vague and indeed all-encompassing, which I doubt was
   the intention.  Added UTI 151.

08-158:

  - This was included as part of 08-019r1.
    A pity we couldn't group the editorial corrections and pass them as a
    single paper.  Oh wait, we did.  Then why is this still here?  08-019r1
    is a perfectly good response to the Canada comment that lead to 08-158,
    seeing as how it includes it!

08-162r2:

  - This was included as part of 08-019r1.

08-165r1:

  Done.

08-166r1:

  Done.  Congratulations to the author of these edits for making two
  near-impenetrable paragraphs even more complicated.  Does anyone else
  actually understand these?

08-178:

  Done.

08-181:

  - [308:12.7 C1280] Instead,
      - deleted "is a dummy argument of a pure function,"
      - changed "INTENT (IN) of a pure subroutine"
        to "the INTENT (IN) attribute".
    Unless I am very much mistaken, this has the same effect and is much
    shorter and simpler.  That is, instead of the requested
      "is a dummy argument of a pure function that does not have the VALUE
       attribute, is a dummy argument with INTENT (IN) of a pure
       subroutine,"
    it now simply reads
      "is a dummy argument with the INTENT (IN) attribute,".

08-214:

  N1760 says "has been added" but this deletes a (mis)feature!

08-256r2:

  See 08-300.

08-275r1:

  Done.

08-276:

  Done.

08-277r2:

  - [175:8.1.7.1p2] Did not insert the extra comma.

  - [176:8.1.7.1p4] Added "(DO CONCURRENT)" after "<forall-header>".

  Did various other wordsmithing and typesetting things to that subclause
  in Annex C.  Also a bit in Annex B.

08-278:

  I don't agree with the general rules stated in this paper, nor with the
  out-of-date style guide referred to (if Strunk turns up in person I'm
  willing to debate the matter with him, though).
  - 2.1.9: no, descriptive.
  - 2.1.12: (1) no, pronoun (2) also deleted "same".
  - 2.1.28: no, pronoun.
  - 2.1.55: no, pronoun.
  - 2.1.103: deleted instead.
  - 2.1.109: deleted instead.
  - 2.1.115: kept the comma.
  - 2.1.116.6: correct as is.
  - 2.1.116.12.1: no, pronoun.
  - 2.3.3.1p1: no, pronoun.
  - 2.3.5p2: correct as is.
  - 2.5.1.1p2: correct as is.
  - 4.5.3.1p4: correct as is.
  - 6.3p1: no, pronoun.
  - 6.5.4p2: correct as is.
  - 7.1.1p2: correct as is.
  - 7.1.5.2.1p5: correct as is (yes, the "of" is necessary).
  - 8.1.3.2p1 correct as is.
  - 8.1.4p1 ok.
  Rejected everything else as being correct as is, except for:
  - 14.11.2p7: rewrote from scratch since it was wrong anyway.

  Indexed "transformational function".
  Unindexed "intrinsic function!elemental" and "intrinsic
    function!transformational".

08-281r2 (part 3):

  - [346:13.7.60p5 EXTENDS_TYPE_OF, Result Value]
    Did not delete "otherwise", i.e. changed to "otherwise if ...".
  Hyperlinked "extensible" and "declared" to "extensible type" and
  "declared type".

08-285:

  - [415:14.11.25p3] Instead, changed all but one of the inquiry function
      argument descriptions for X to copy the wording from the intrinsic
      inquiry functions.

08-286:

  - ANSI have changed their document in 2007 so that its title is
    different, but it's still true that ISO 646 is the equivalent to the
    old document (a 1991 ISO standard certainly was not derived from the
    2007 revision, even if that revision only changed the title).  So I
    have left this one alone.  Its title seems to be
      "ANSI INCITS 4-1986 (R2007)"
    anyway...
  - Made all references to ISO 10646 into undated references.  Our use of
    UCS-4 seems ok to me.
  Also removed full stops from each normative reference - they are not
    supposed to be there (weird, eh?).
  Also modified wording of the various references to accord with the
    ISO guidelines.

08-289r1:

  - [3:1.5.4p3+] "SIGN intrinsic function"->"intrinsic function SIGN"
                 for consistency.

08-290r2

  - [32:2.4.5p3+] Unless I am very much mistaken, this defines a term,
    and imposes a requirement, in a note.  This is not permitted.
    Added UTI 152.

    The added text is not quite grammatical.  I did not try hard to reword
    it since it almost certainly needs more rewording on technical grounds.
    Included this in UTI 152.  (Once the technical problems are clarified I
    will be in a position to assist rewording if that would be helpful.)

  - [36:2.5.7Note 2.18+] Changed "the image" to "that image".

  - [100:5.3.19p2] I find the added requirement difficult to understand;
                   the exact extent of the requirement is unclear.
                   Added UTI 153.

  - [190:p2-] Added comma after "image P" on the first line;
              used bullets not numbers for the first list;
              changed segment "Pi" to "\segment{i}{P}" i.e. P_i (P sub i),
              and "Qj" to Q_j similarly;
              changed "takes the following form" to "occurs when" (since
              no "form" is being described): this might be wrong, someone
              else should check(!);
              uncapitalised the first word of the list items in the second
              list;
              used bullets not numbers for the second list;
              changed "starts" to "begins";
              singularised "actions" - only one is described;
              changed "affecting" to "regarding", twice (inquiring array
              bounds does not "affect" the object).

              I'm not quite sure I have a good handle on this, since it
              seems to me that this follows without the SYNC MEMORY (i.e.
              those are the defined semantics of the language).
              Presumably some other image is involved - I can see how that
              might change things.  Maybe I should add Yet Another UTI,
              ... or maybe someone could tell me what I've missed?  Without
              explanation I am quite likely to add a UTI next time around.

  - [309:C1279+] Changed "The designator for" to "A <designator> of", which
                 is a bit closer to the text in the interp (only differs in
                 the article, "A" vs. "The" - on further reflection I think
                 "A" is correct).

  - [460:Annex A] Changed "user-defined synchronizations"
                  to "cooperative synchronization"
                  (that being what we called it in c08).

08-291r2:

  Done.

08-292r1:

  Done.  I shortened several of these even more, and adjusted the column
  widths in Table 13.1 to improve the layout.  I also redid some of the
  nearby typesetting because I noticed it was lacking.

08-296r2:

  - [254:10.7.5.2.2p3] Changed "G0.d" to "G0.<d>".
  - [461:Annex A] Omitted the second and third definite articles.

08-295:

  Done.

08-297r1

  - [188:p6] Deleted "intrinsic" between "atomic" and "subroutine",
             twice: it is redundant seeing as how that is part of
             the definition.
  - [191:Note 8.38] Replaced the first line with "these three lines"
                    not "these two lines";
                    adjusted comment indentation to line up again;
                    swapped arguments to ATOMIC_REF to match intrinsic.
  - [316:13.5p2] Added comma to end of line.
  - [317:Table 13.1] Added full stops to each description.
      Actually, these break rule 1 of brief descriptions: that they must be
      the same in the table as in the actual specification.  Used editorial
      licence to *seriously* simplify these.
  - [327:After "13.7.11 ALLOCATED..."] No, I inserted these alphabetically
      instead.  With the same brief description I used in the p317 edit.
      And massive rewording to try to get these consistent with other
      intrinsic procedures.  Found a technical problem - UTI 154.

  Also, made "atomic subroutine" a defined (sub-)term (of "subroutine").

08-298r2:

  - [95:5.3.10p2] The phrase appears twice, so I did this edit twice
      (once for nonpointer, once for pointer).

08-299r1:

  Done.

08-300 (incorporating 08-256r2):

  - [25] Deleted initial indefinite article;
         changed "defined in" to "from";
         deleted final full stop;
         added forward reference to c06
         (this might not be needed after other fixups).

  - [59] Changed "defined in" to "from".  I note that if its parent type
         has an ultimate component of LOCK_TYPE then the new type will too.

  - [115] Not impressed by this way of structuring; lock variables could
          just as easily be done as a 6.3 instead of a 6.2.2 avoiding
          the grotty "6.2.1 General" heading.

  - [116] Singularised "6.2.2 Lock variables" since 6.2 is "Variable";
          unemboldened "lock variable" in p1;
          changed "defined in" to "from";
          "can" means capability - fine so far as it goes but was this
          meant to be an exhaustive list? - added UTI 155;
          the first added constraint is ambiguous - UTI 156;
          why is the variable defn context not a constraint - UTI 157;
          as far as I can tell the note is talking about something
          that doesn't exist - UTI 158;

  - [187:8.5.1p2] Why is this list not alphabetical?

  - [191] Appended full stop to constraint;
          fixed number consistency in lock variable value sentence;
          "acquired/released" terminology is confusing - UTI 159;
          changed "<lock-variable>" to "specified lock variable",
          since it is not the syntax term that is being locked;
          next para: "a <lock-variable>"->"a lock variable",
          "the <lock-variable>"->"the lock variable" (twice),
          "value of the scalar logical variable"->
          "variable specified by the ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifier" (twice).

          Sigh.  Ok, I made lots more random changes to try to beat this
          into shape.  Probably failed.  Some things left undone noted
          as part of the aforementioned UTI 159.

  - [192:8.5.5p1+] The editing instructions were incomplete and the
      insertion is an indigestible lump.  UTI 160.

  - [192:8.5.5p2] Alphabetised and rewrote statement.

  - [397:13.8.2.13+] Some wordsmithing done, but not enough.
      What about constants?  UTI 161 (this overlaps somewhat with
      an earlier UTI).

  - [398:3.8.2.18+] Comment to editor: about half of these named
      constants are described as "named constant" and the other half
      as simply "constant".  Can't we be consistent?

  - [398:3.8.2.19+] It asked me to add this three times, but I only
      did it once.  With some rewording.

  - [454:16.6.5p1] Reworded.

  - [456:16.6.7p1] Reworded.

  Also added UTI 162 re ATOMIC_INT_KIND/ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND.

08-301r1:

  [285:12.5.1 C1229+] Inserted an indefinite article.

08-304:

  [c.460 Annex A] Added ref to 13.1 Classes of intrinsic procedures.

08-306:

  - Combined 1.2 and 1.3 into 1.1,
  - Modified Annex A to properly reference the new 1.1 instead of the
    old 1.3;
  - Moved 1.8 to be subclause 1.2.
  - Moved 2.1 to be subclause 1.3.
  - Moved 1.6 to be subclause 1.4, with the following changes.
    Deleted 1.6.1 except for the last sentence which I moved,
    modified, to 1.1 immediately after the "This standard specifies"
    paragraph.  Deleted 1.6.2.  The meanings of shall, NOTE, etc. are
    all prescribed by ISO, not by us.  Renamed 1.6 to be "Notation,
    symbols and abbreviated terms" (probably won't get away with the
    "Notation" part but it's worth a try).
  - Moved 1.4 to be subclause 1.5.
  - I don't agree that 1.5 is not normative... so it is the new 1.6.
  - 1.7 remains 1.7.
  - Moved 2.2 to be subclause 2.1.  I'm considering moving some of the
    clause 1 material here instead, but anyway... it cannot be moved to
    be clause 2 (as requested by 08-306) because what would than happen
    to 2.3 2.4 2.5 and 2.6?

08-308r1:

  De-indexed subcomponent (retaining hyperlinking) in c06.

08-309:

  Done.

09-101:

  Done.

N1760 mentions "an editorial change to the specification of the intrinsic
  SIZE" without mentioning what paper if any this is supposed to be in.
  I am not impressed with the accuracy or readability of N1760, which has
  omitted many papers passed at the joint meeting for no apparent reason.
  As editor, I am supposed to do what the working group requests; it would
  be nice to have gotten clearer instructions!


5. Papers not processed, pending action items
---------------------------------------------

Paper 08-217 was not approved at meeting 186; did this not form part of
the US national ballot?  Presumably not.  Therefore I have not done any
edit from that paper.

DEFERRED:
[85:5.1p3+] Append new paragraph at the end of the subclause:
  "Accessibility attributes apply to identifiers, not the entities they
  identify, and these attributes may be different in different scoping
  units.  An entity may have the \attrx{ASYNCHRONOUS} or \attrx{VOLATILE}
  attributes in some scoping units and not have them in others."
***EDITOR: Reword to consistently use singular?
COMMENT: An identifier *is* an entity (an entity is *anything*!).
         These comments, after fixing, belong in the relevant attribute
         subclauses; no-one would think to look in the introductory waffle
         to find this out.
{08-226r4, m185}

PENDING ACTION ITEMS:
 - "simply contiguous" should be a defined term;
 - "dummy argument" should be indexed;
 - index "declared type"?
 - should "unlimited polymorphic" be a defined term?  indexed?
 - "segment" ***must*** be a defined term!
 - can't we just use <designator> always and get rid of the defined term?
 - index "rounding mode" properly.  But first, we have two of them: should
   we clarify one or both?
 - Is type-bound procedure a defined term?  If so, index it.
 - Most of the "tdef"s should be defined terms in 1.3; the others ought to
   be in normal (not bold) font; the witter about bold font meaning a
   defined term needs to be deleted.
 - Add j3.cls macros \defstmt and \refstmt (and \urefstmt?), and use them,
   similarly \defconstruct and \refconstruct.
 - Turn hyperlink colouring off... 09-007r1 or 09-007r2?
