Subject:   Wart removal proposal -- VALUE and VOLATILE
From:      Van Snyder
Date: 2015 January 07
Reference: 15-007

1. Introduction
===============

There is no reason to prohibit a dummy argument with the VALUE attribute
to have the VOLATILE attribute.  Since the value dummy argument is
copied from the actual argument (see 12.5.2.3p4), the VOLATILE attribute
does not apply to the corresponding actual argument.  It is impossible
for volatility to commence before an executable construct is executed.
Prohibiting the VOLATILE attribute simply requires one to copy the
argument yet again to a local variable -- but a dummy argument with the
VALUE attribute already is effective a local variable.

2. Proposal
===========

Allow a dummy argument with the VALUE attribute to have the VOLATILE
attribute.

3. Edits
========

[xviii, Introduction, under "Program units and procedures"] Insert list
item

"-- A dummy argument with the VALUE attribute may have the VOLATILE
    attribute."

[106:16] Replace "POINTER, or VOLATILE" with "or POINTER".

[298:15] Append a sentence (or maybe a note) "If it also has the
VOLATILE attribute, it is impossible for volatility to commence before
an executable construct is executed."
