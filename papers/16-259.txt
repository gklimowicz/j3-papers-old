1. Edits
--------

[99:26,28 8.5.1p1,C815]  It is unlikely somebody would look for
constraint C815 at this place.  It applies only to the relationship of
R815 to function results.  More obvious places to look for it are
immediately after R815, or after R1530.

Replace "constraints apply" with "constraint applies".  Make C815 a
constraint on R815 and move it to [104:14+ R815+] with the same text, or
move it to [330:33+ C1560+]:

"C1560a If the function result is a nonallocatable nonpointer array, the
        <array-spec> shall be an <explicit-shape-spec-list>."

[100:18 8.5.4p1] Replace "entity" with "variable"  Delete "is a variable
that".

[100:31-32 8.5.4p4] Replace "an object" with "a variable" because
objects that aren't variables can't have the attribute.  Then move the
final sentence of 8.5.4p4 to be the final sentence of 8.5.4p1 at
[100:19].

[105:19+ R819+] Insert a constraint:

"C831a (R819) An <assumed-shape-spec-list> shall not appear if the array
       is not a dummy data object."

[105:26-27 8.5.8.4p1] Delete the paragraph because it's the same as
C832.

[105:29-30 C832] Should be "if and only if".  Replace C832:

"C832 (R820) A <deferred-shape-spec-list> shall appear if and only if
      the array has the POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attribute."

{This does not require that a variable with the POINTER or ALLOCATABLE
attribute be a deferred-shape array; it can be a scalar.}

[108:30+4 NOTE 8.14] After "coarrays" insert ", which would require
synchronization,".

[109:0+14-15 NOTE 8.16] Before "association" insert "pointer".  Replace
"the operations allowed" with "operations".

[109:0+18,21 NOTE 8.17] Delete "slightly more sophisticated".  Delete
"to see".  Delete "more sophisticated".

[111:15-16 8.5.15p2] Before "execution" insert "completing".  Replace
"RETURN or END statement" with "procedure or BLOCK construct".  {The
definition of END statement in 5.3.3 doesn't include END BLOCK.}

[112:7 8.5.16p4] The sentence lists the "other kinds of scoping units".
Delete "other kind of".

[112:14+9,11 NOTE 8.24] Replace "will have" with "has".  Replace "point
only to" with "be associated only with" {Fortran pointers don't "point
to"}.

[116:2 C875] Replace "starting point, and substring ending point" with
"range" {It's good enough to use the term "substring range" in C8101}.

[116:34+ C887+]  Insert a constraint

"C887a (R838) The lengths of the expanded sequences of variables and of
       <data-stmt-constant>s shall be the same."

[117:8-9 8.6.7p8] Delete "The lengths ... the same." because of the
previous edit.

[118:11 R852+] Insert a constraint:

"C887b The value of a named constant shall not be specified more than
       once."

{The value of a named constant is not an attribute, so it's not covered
by C814}.

[120:34 8.7p3] Before "mapping" insert "nonnull" because an IMPLICIT
NONE statement specifies a mapping, a null mapping, but nonetheless a
mapping.

[124:8 C898] After "coarray" insert ", a subobject of a coarray, a
coindexed object"

[124:25+2 NOTE 8.42] Replace "the equivalencing" with "storage
association" twice.

[124:35-26 8.9.1.3p1] Delete the first sentence, beginning "A default
character..." because it's the same as C8103.

[125:10 8.9.2.1p1] Replace "Thus, the" with "The" because the conclusion
doesn't follow from the premise.

2. Question without edits
-------------------------

[101:4 R808] In light of the C standard having a mechanism to allow
external names to be composed of characters other than those of 8859-1,
why is the binding name restricted to default characters?

[121-122] Do we really need two pages of examples for the IMPLICIT
statement?  Couldn't at least some of this be in Annex C?
