Subject:  Bug in the Procedure Pointers feature?

Incorrect statement that may need fixing 
(i.e. possible "bug" in the standard).

-------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.3.2 line 27 says
"A module procedure may be invoked by another module subprogram in the module
or by any scoping unit that accesses the module procedure by use association"

This leaves out the case where module procedure P is invoked via a 
procedure pointer from a location where the module procedure is
not accessed by use association, e.g.
	MODULE M
        CONTAINS
        FUNCTION P()
        P = 1776.
        END FUNCTION P
        END MODULE

        USE M
        PROCEDURE (REAL), POINTER :: C
        C => P
        CALL S(C)
        CONTAINS

        SUBROUTINE S(Q)
        PROCEDURE (REAL), POINTER :: Q
! invoke module procedure P which is not use-associated with Q
        PRINT *, Q()
        END SUBROUTINE S

        END PROGRAM
