Subject: Documenting Compiler Versions


This paper is a "doneness" paper for the "Documenting
Compiler Versions" feature for f03++, which got
a Hate -> Love vote of 0-0-9-2 at 167, and has not been
reconsidered since.

What follows is pretty nearly J3/04-137, but I've fixed
some bugs in that paper.

Title: Document Processor Version

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: 

Basic Functionality: Add to iso_fortran_env a processor defined
                     character constant, scalar or rank-1,
                     of processor-defined length, containing
                     processor specified version information.

Rationale:  Many times, after a suspected compiler bug has been detected,
            the next step is to check a bug database.  This lookup
            needs the compiler's version information to succeed.  Today,
            this comes from a "-V" or "-version" command line option,
            or some other processor dependent means.  Even when the bug
            is an application error, knowing the compiler version
            which first detected it is often helpful.

            Benchmarks and verifications also must document the exact
            processor used to compile the application.

Estimated Impact: The Estimate is 3 on the John Reid scale.

                  Processors would have to make their version strings
                  available via a name in iso_fortran_env.
                  Vendors might actually benefit from more detailed
                  bug reports.

Detailed Specification: Add to iso_fortran_env a default character constant
                        or rank-1 constant array named processor_version.
                        This will contain the processor-dependent
                        version information.

                        If defined by standard Fortran, it's declaration
                        might appear similar to:

                        character( len= *), parameter :: processor_version = &
                           'Ajax Fortran 2008 Version 0.99+ (beta)'

                        or, perhaps:

                        character( len= 72), dimension( 3), parameter :: &
                           processor_version = [ 'Acme Fortran 2008 v 8.2a', &
                              'Acme SuperLinker v 5.6c', &
                              'Acme RTL v 3.4e' ]

                        In any case, a programmer could add:

                        write(*,*) trim( processor_version)

                        to an application to document the processor in use
                        in the application's preconnected output file.

                        Perhaps add a Note detailing that the usefulness
                        of this feature may be subverted by users who mix-and-
                        match components from several releases of a processor.
