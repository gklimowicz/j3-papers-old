Subject: Issue 22 : co-arrays and type extension
Reference: J3/06-007

Discussion of Issue 22 (page 125)

The intention with co-array components was that the feature
be kept simple. It should be restricted to address the problems
raised by the editor here. Specifically, type extension should be
restricted from adding co-array ultimate components unless the
parent type already has such components. The only other way that 
an allocation could end up having a dynamic type with co-array 
subcomponents is via <type-spec> or <source-expr>, which should 
explicitly be prohibited from having co-array ultimate components.

Edits to J3/06-007.

[57:7+] Add new constraint after C433
   C433a (R430) If EXTENDS appears and the type being defined has a 
         co-array ultimate component, the parent type shall have a
         co-array ultimate component.

[124:28] Add to the end of C628 "and shall have no co-array ultimate 
components".

[124:34+]. Add extra constraints after C631:
   C631a (R627) If <source-expr> appears, its type shall have no 
         co-array ultimate components.

[125:18] Delete "The dynamic type shall not have a co-array ultimate 
component."
