Discussion
----------


Malcolm Cohen has suggested that FAILED_IMAGES should

(1) talk about the number of images "known by the invoking image as having
failed", otherwise this has to return the same results on all images,
even ones in different teams which cannot know this fact without either
substantial "image failure handling and propagation" machinery (which I
think unlikely to exist) or similar; and

(2) say that after an image control statement that returned a
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE result, the return value includes the index of at
least one image in the set of images being communicated with (and that
failed).  I think that perhaps it should not be required to return the
indices of all the images that have failed since the communications
protocol is likely to return STAT_FAILED_IMAGE as soon as one image has
failed rather than wait to see if there are more that have failed.

Corresponding edits to FAILED_IMAGES are included here.

Edits to N2007:
---------------

[24:14] Change "failed images in the specified team" to
"images in the specified team that are known by the invoking image to
have failed".

[24:16] Change "failed images" to "known failed images".

[24:17] Append "If the executing image has previously executed an image
control statement whose STAT= specifier assigned the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE or invoked a collective subroutine whose STAT
argument was set to STAT_FAILED_IMAGE and has not meanwhile entered or
left a CHANGE TEAM construct, at least one image in the set of images
participating in that image control statement or collective invocation
shall be known to have failed."

[24:19] Change "failed images in the current team" to
"images in the current team that are known by the invoking image to
have failed".
