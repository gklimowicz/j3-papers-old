Issue 87:  [84:18-27]
Issue 88:  [88:16-25]

1. Issue 87

Issue 87 mentions that part of the description of the VALUE attribute
might be better put in the form of a constraint, since it is
compile-time checkable. It also mentions that one of the constraints
of the INTENT attribute applies to the VALUE attribute. The
constraints are listed in the section on the VALUE statement and in
the general section on the type declaration statement.

Edits:

[84:15-16] Delete first sentence of paragraph.

[88:13+] Add:

Constraint: The VALUE attribute shall be specified only for a scalar
dummy argument of a subprogram or interface body that has a
<language-binding-spec>.

Constraint: The VALUE attribute shall not be specified for a dummy
argument that is a dummy procedure.

[71:19+] Add:

Constraint: The VALUE attribute shall be specified only for a scalar
dummy argument of a subprogram or interface body that has a
<language-binding-spec>.

Constraint: The VALUE attribute shall not be specified for a dummy
argument that is a dummy procedure.

2. Issue 88

Editor proposes to delete constraints, which are already covered by a
syntax-rule. This implies that syntax rules are diagnosed by the
processor.

Edits:

[88:14-15] Delete

[84:42-43] Delete

[85:8-9] Delete

[88:16-25] Delete J3 note

3. Misc.

Section 16.2.6 has missed one requirement on interoperation between
Fortran procedures and C functions, viz. that dummy arguments not be
allowed to have the OPTIONAL attribute.

[410:16] Change:

"POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attribute." to
"POINTER, ALLOCATABLE or OPTIONAL attribute."
