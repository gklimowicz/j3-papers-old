Subject: Specifying length parameter values in C_F_POINTER
Date: 2022-February-03
Reference: 22-007

Allowing to specify lower bounds of FPTR in a reference to C_F_POINTER is
a step forward, but it is still not possible to specify the values of its
length parameters. Of course, this is (almost) pointless without allowing
C_LOC to have an argument that has length type parameters.

[499:19+ 18.2.3.3 C_F_POINTER] After "LOWER" insert "LEN".

[499:29 18.2.3.3 C_F_POINTER] In the description of FPTR delete ", shall
not have a deferred type parameter,"

[499:31 18.2.3.3 C_F_POINTER] Append a sentence: " The value of the <n>th
deferred length parameter of FPTR is the value of the <n>th element of
LEN."

{Don't use LEN(n) because that assumes the lower bound of LEN is 1.}

[500:14+ 18.2.3.3 C_F_POINTER] Add a description of the LEN argument

LEN (optional)  shall be a rank-one integer array. It is an INTENT (IN)
    argument. If FPTR has deferred length parameters, LEN shall appear and
    not be an optional dummy argument.  Its size shall not be less than
    the number of deferred length parameters of FPTR.

{Len can appear even if FPTR has no length type parameters.}

[504:10 18.2.3.7p3 LOC] Remove "that has no length type parameter".

NOTE

It would be nice to do this with a second interface

C_F_POINTER ( CPTR, FPTR, LEN [, SHAPE, LOWER ] )

but this would require generic resolution to include whether FPTR has
deferred length parameters.
