Subject: Issue 58 : FORM_TEAM Note
Reference: J3/06-007


Discussion of issue 58 (page 340)

The first sentence of Note 13.1 repeats normative text from Clause 2,
and the remainder overlaps with the text in C.10.2 [574:25-28].
Considering that the example is out of place, we propose to delete the
Note and incorporate this example into C.10.2. Edits to correct
several errors in C.10.2 are also provided.


Edit to J3/06-007

[339:18+] Delete Note 13.1.

[574:26-28] Replace "A note there ... for example:" with "Simple
routines can be written to also apply the operation to the elements of
the co-array on an image. Various versions of a global sum can be
programmed, for example:"

[574:32+] Add a new function to the example:

   REAL FUNCTION global_sum(array)
       REAL,INTENT(IN) :: array(:,:)[*]
       REAL,SAVE       :: temp[*]
       temp = SUM(array)  !  Sum on the executing image
       CALL CO_SUM(temp, global_sum)
   END FUNCTION global_sum

[574:33] Delete ", mask(:,:)"

[574:33+] Insert a new line of code:

       LOGICAL,INTENT(IN) :: mask(:,:)

[574:35] Replace "of the local part of the co-array" with "on the executing image"

[574:39,42] Replace "global_sum" with "global_sum_dim" twice.

[575:1,4,5] Replace "global_sum" with "global_sum_dim" thrice.

[575:3] Replace "of the local part of the co-array" with "on the executing image"
