1. Introduction
===============

Paper 14-205r1 proposed some edits to FAILED_IMAGES intrinsic,
which should be also applied to the STOPPED_IMAGES intrinsic
in 14-141r2.


2. Edits to 14-141r2
====================

The following edits apply to the STOPPED_IMAGES.

At "Result Characteristics", change "the kind type parameter is
KIND(0)" to "the kind type parameter is that of default integer
type. The result is an array of rank one whose size is equal to the
number of images in the specified team that have initiated normal
termination.".

At "Result Value", change "image indices of the stopped images" to
"indices of the images that have initiated normal termination".

At the end of the paragraph of "Result Value", append "If the
executing image has previously executed an image control statement
whose STAT= specifier assigned the value STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE or invoked
a collective subroutine whose STAT argument was set to
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, and has not meanwhile entered or left a CHANGE
TEAM construct, at least one image in the set of images participating
in that image control statement or collective invocation shall have
initiated normal termination."

At the "Example", change "stopped images in the current team" to
"images in the current team that have initiated normal termination".
