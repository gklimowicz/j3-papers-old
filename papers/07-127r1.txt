Discussion

UTI 86 (page 200) asks if it would be better to have the SYNC TEAM
statement verify that the executing image is part of the image-team,
as opposed to making the program non-conforming if that is not the
case. We believe the answer is no.  The point of teams is high
performance.  Adding this required check into the execution of a SYNC
TEAM statement is counter to that goal. Furthermore, the check burden
gets increasingly large as the number of images grows, potentially
hurting scaling as well.

A programmer can extract the list of images from an image-team
variable with the TEAM_IMAGES intrinsic function and perform a check
if desired. In addition, an implementation is allowed to have a debug
mode that would link in slower versions of the sync statements that
could do checking of this sort.  But requiring this check all the time
is undesirable.

If a check to validate the value of an image-team variable is seen as
a requirement, it should be done in the FORM_TEAM intrinsic
subroutine, where the check's affect on performance would be less
significant.  Assuming a team is cleanly formed, it should not later
become defective, so checks in later usage would be a unnecessary.
