1. Discussion
=============

C1037 is a constraint on a <forall-body-construct> that concerns the
properties of procedures that can be referenced therein.

C1138 is a constraint on a DO CONCURRENT construct that concerns the
properties of procedures that can be referenced therein, but it's not
obvious that it has the same effect.  One might interpret it to apply
only to procedures referenced by their names.  It should be as obvious
as C1037.

2. Edits
========

[194:17 C1138 11.1.7.5 Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT
constructs] Replace C1138:

"C1138 Any procedure referenced within a DO CONCURRENT construct,
       including one referenced by a defined operation, assignment, or
       finalization, shall be a pure procedure."
