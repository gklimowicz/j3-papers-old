In Note 4.66 [65] it is noted that "The kind type parameter for 
PRIMARY_COLORS is processor dependent", but as pointed out by
Richard Maine there is no way provided to determine which kind type
parameter a particular processor chose.  Subgroup felt that the problems
brought up by Richard were not significant enough to warrant a 
technical change.

To fix the syntax error in Note 4.66:

[65:13+4] Change

              ENUM, BIND(C) :: PRIMARY_COLORS
to
              ENUM, BIND(C)

and
[65:13+9] Change

              PRIMARY_COLORS
to
              this enumeration
and
[65:13+11] Changed
              is one possible equivalent for PRIMARY_COLORS.
to
              might be equivalent to the above enumeration definition.

And to address the issue raised by Richard, extend Note 4.66
with additional text:

[65:13+13+] Add

Entities of the same kind parameter value can be declared using the
intrinsic function KIND with one of the enumerators as its argument,
for examples

         INTEGER(KIND(RED)) :: X, Y, Z
