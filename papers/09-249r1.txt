Subject: Contradictions in 9.6.4, "User-defined derived-type" isn't used
Date: 2009 August 10
References: 09-007r2

1.  Introduction

9.6.4p2 and p3 contradict 9.6.4.7.

The term "User-defined derived-type input/output" is defined in 9.6.4.7
and not used anywhere.

The term "User-defined derived-type editing" is a subclause title but
is not used anywhere.

2.  Edits w.r.t. 09-007r2

[219:20: 9.6.4p2 item(6)] ----------------------------------------------
Editor: After "namelist" insert ", except those that are processed by
defined input/output procedures {ref 9.6.4.7}.".

{Don't contradict 9.6.4.7.}

[219:42 9.6.4p3 item(7)] -----------------------------------------------
Editor: After "namelist" insert ", except those that are processed by
defined input/output procedures {ref 9.6.4.7}.".

{Don't contradict 9.6.4.7.}

[223:19 9.6.4.7] -------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the subclause title by "Defined input/output".  So as
not to require changing numerous references, insert an explicit
\label{D9:User-defined derived-type input/output}.

[223:21-22 9.6.4.7.1p1] ------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "User-defined derived-type input/output" by "<<Defined
input/output>>".  Then delete the second sentence because it's
repetitive and redundant and doesn't say anything new.

[259:9 10.7.6] ---------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "User-defined" by "Defined".  So as
not to require changing the reference in 1.3.109.4, insert an explicit
\label{D10:User-defined derived-type editing}.
