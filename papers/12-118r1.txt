Subject: Interp - finalization of INTENT(OUT) arguments
Date: 2012 February 15

NUMBER: F08/0070
TITLE: Finalization of INTENT(OUT) arguments
KEYWORDS: finalization INTENT(OUT)
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTIONS:

The following questions assume the new text for paragraph 8 of
Clause 4.5.6.3 provided in Corrigendum 1.  The new text states

     When a procedure is invoked, an object that becomes
     argument associated with a nonpointer, nonallocatable
     INTENT(OUT) dummy argument of that procedure is
     finalized.  The finalization caused by INTENT(OUT) is
     considered to occur within the invoked procedure; so
     for elemental procedures, an INTENT(OUT) argument will
     be finalized only if a scalar or elemental final
     subroutine is available, regardless of the rank of the
     actual argument.

Question 1:

Suppose an explicit-shape dummy array is argument associated with an
array that has more elements than the dummy array.  Are all of the
elements of the effective argument of the dummy array finalized or
are only those elements associated with elements of the dummy array
finalized?

Question 2:

The last sentence of paragraph 17 of Clause 12.5.2.4 states

     If the dummy argument is not polymorphic and the type of
     the effective argument is an extension of the type of the
     dummy argument, only the part of the effective argument
     that is of the same type as the dummy argument becomes
     undefined.

In such a case, is the entire effective argument finalized or is only
the part of the effective argument that becomes undefined finalized?

Question 3:

Is the argument finalized before it becomes undefined?

Question 4:

If so, can its value be used in a specification expression?

ANSWERS:

A1. Only the part properly associated with the dummy argument was
    intended to be finalized; an edit is supplied to clarify this.

A2. This is answered by interpretations F08/0068 and F08/0069;
    the quoted text has been deleted.

A3. Yes.  This is clarified by the same edit as for question 1.

A4. No, because it becomes undefined on procedure invocation.

EDITS:

Delete, in the quoted text,
  "an object that becomes argument associated with"
and after "is finalized" insert
  "before it becomes undefined"
Making the whole paragraph read
    "When a procedure is invoked, a nonpointer, nonallocatable
     INTENT(OUT) dummy argument of that procedure is finalized before
     it becomes undefined.  The finalization caused by INTENT(OUT) is
     considered to occur within the invoked procedure; so for
     elemental procedures, an INTENT(OUT) argument will be finalized
     only if a scalar or elemental final subroutine is available,
     regardless of the rank of the actual argument."
