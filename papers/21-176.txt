Discussion
----------

I think I have found a glitch associated with US 13. C1612 says:

"A named variable with declared type NOTIFY_TYPE shall be a coarray. 
A named variable with a potential subobject component of 
type NOTIFY_TYPE shall be a coarray."

This is modeled on C1604 which says
"A named variable with declared type EVENT_TYPE shall be a coarray. 
A named variable with a noncoarray potential subobject component of 
type EVENT_TYPE shall be a coarray."

The important adjective "noncoarray" is missing from the second 
sentence of C1612. It is important because we should allow a noncoarray 
variable that has a coarray potential subobject component of type 
EVENT_TYPE. 

Also, I propose a editorial correction on page 212. 


Edits to 21-007r2
-----------------
[212:15] In 11.7.2 Segments, para 3, sentence 3 replace 
"execution an" by "execution of an" to make the sentence read
"A variable defined in an unordered segment only by execution of an 
assignment statement with a NOTIFY= specifier may be referenced or 
defined after execution of a NOTIFY WAIT statement that satisfies that 
assignment statement execution."

[456:37] In 16.10.2.22 NOTIFY_TYPE, C1612, second sentence, add 
"noncoarray" before "potential" to make the sentence read
"A named variable with a noncoarray potential subobject component of 
type NOTIFY_TYPE shall be a coarray."
