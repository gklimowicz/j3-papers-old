1. Introduction

This issue says that the paragraph [125:27-29] is unnecessary.  This
paragraph
says
   "For derived types, values are assigned to type parameters as specified
in
    4.5.5.  For intrinsic types, values are assigned to type parameters,
with
    corresondence determined by position or by name as defined in 5.1."

But at [125:17-18] we already have:
  "The optional <type-spec> specifies the dynamic type and type parameters
of
   the objects to be allocated."
which IMO says it all - we do not need to be told where to find the rules
for
assigning <type-param-value>s to type parameters.

Therefore I agree with the J3 note that the extra paragraph should be
deleted.
