Discussion
----------

Request for the following was made on behalf of a user:

1) Add EVENT CLEAR ( ) statement. Use case: Event posts are used to
"check in" to an event counter.  The counter owner uses QUERY_EVENT to
determine when everyone has checked in, but never does an actual EVENT
WAIT. When the count indicating "completion" is achieved, the image
processes the (now complete) set of data and the count is reset to
zero using EVENT CLEAR ( ). This offers significantly better
performance compared to executing a loop of EVENT WAIT statements to
wind down the count.

2) Add an optional COUNT=<scalar-int-var> to EVENT POST to return the
count value after the post completed.  Can be used to provide slot
numbers in an array where the poster can deposit values into the
target image.
