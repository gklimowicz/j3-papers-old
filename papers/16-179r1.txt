----------

The same issue occurs for any image control statement that contains an
expression and is covered by this sentence in 8.6.2 "The segment
executed immediately before the execution of an image control statement
includes the evaluation of all expressions within the statement."

Edit to J3/16-007r1:
--------------------

[178:9+] In 8.1.5 CHANGE TEAM construct, para 4, delete UTI 20.
