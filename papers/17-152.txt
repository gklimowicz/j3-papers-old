-----------

OPERATION in CO_REDUCE is not required to have a scalar result,
although it clearly would not work unless it did. It also needs the
other restrictions that apply to the arguments. Edits are supplied
to address this.

Edits to 17-007:
---------------

[371:17-19] In 16.9.49, CO_REDUCE, para on OPERATION, first two
sentences, replace
"each argument shall be a scalar, nonallocatable, nonpointer,
nonpolymorphic, nonoptional dummy data object with the same type and
type parameters as A. Its result shall have the same type and type
parameters as A."
by
"the result and each argument shall be a scalar, nonallocatable,
nonpointer, nonpolymorphic, data object with the same type and type
parameters as A. The arguments shall not be optional."
