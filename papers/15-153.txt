Subject: Correct text for definition of ordering of segments

1. Discussion

The text defining user-defined ordering between segments in 8.5.5 is
imprecise, awkwardly worded and inadequate for determining transitive
ordering.


2. Edits to 15-007

[194:1] Change "to precede" with "to immediately precede"


[194:5]  Append new sentence:

"Segment P_i on image P precedes segment Q_j on image Q if
and only if there exists a sequence of segments P_i, S^1_{m_1}, S^2_{m_2},
... S^n_{m_n}, Q_j such that

- S^k_{m_k} is a segment on image S^k
- P_i immediately precedes S^1_{m_1}
- S^k_{m_k} immediately precedes S^{k+1}_{m_{k+1}} for k = 1, 2, ..., n-1
- S^n_{m_n} immediately precedes Q_j
"
