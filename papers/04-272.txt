1.1.11 Comments from members

        V. Snyder pointed out that there were unresolved issues

        including a potential change about private procedures in
        submodules not having a binding label

1.2 Subgroup organization - D. Nagle

        Papers were initially distributed to subgroups as follows:

          /Edit:  222, 228, 234, 238

          /EM:  260

          Librarian:  242

          /JOR:  everything else in the pre-meeting!

1.3 Enhanced Modules Report - V. Snyder

        The latest changes are in paper 04-260

1.4 Subgroup meetings

        J3 acted as JOR to process all of the suggestions for new
        features to consider for the next Fortran Standard after
        Fortran 2003 {F03}.  The process was to have 2 straw votes
        after a brief discussion of each item:

          1.  Should JOR spend time on the proposal?  Love it - Like
              it - Dislike it - Hate it.  A paper getting a majority
              of "Love it - Like it" gets more processing by JOR at
              this meeting.

          2.  How hard is it to implement in compilers?  Small -
              Medium - Large

        The votes are on the concepts of the paper as best we
        understand them, not on the specs or syntax in the paper

        In this mode, approximately 2/3rds of the papers from 101 to
        263 were processed before today's recess.  The results of the
        straw votes were recorded in the spreadsheet in paper 265.

1.5 Subgroup reports - Plenary recessed at 5PM until 8:00 AM Tuesday.

2. Tuesday, March 2, 2004 - Plenary reconvened at 8:00 AM

2.1 F2003 Plenary (00-010) - Subgroup Heads

        J3 acted as JOR to finish processing the remaining "future
        suggestions" papers from 101 to 263.  The results of the
        straw votes were recorded in the spreadsheet in paper 265.

2.2 Tutorials (if needed)

        None

        meeting #166 did not get included in the list of proposed
        edits for the FCD in paper 03-280.  Those edits will be
        included in what /edit proposes at this meeting.

        straw votes on paper 04-222 sections 4 and 8:
          1.  allow private module procedures to have binding labels?
              Yes-No-Undecided: 10-1-1 => no change to F03

        paper 04-265r1 adds JOR's summary of priorities and impact on
        changing the Standard

        JOR looked at paper 04-242 and suggested to J3 that the
        standing document 004 be used to capture the current status
        of suggestions that have been made for features to consider
        for the next Fortran Standard.  It should be in summary form,
        pointing to revelant papers.  J3 agreed to try this.

    /edit:

                    interface in the module have a binding label?
                    Yes-No-Undecided: 9-0-4 => no change to the TR

    /edit:

        Fixing the G format problem reported in paper 03-282 will have
