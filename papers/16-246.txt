Edits to J3/16-007r2
-------------------

[138:6] In 9.6 Image selectors, para 5, sentence 2, after "evaluated"
add "or is a variable that is being defined or partly defined".
[The editor's suggestion in 16-243.]

[215:32] In 11.6.11 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control
statements, para 8, after "CRITICAL" add "statement".

[341:15] In 16.1 Classes of intrinsic procedures, para 4, add
"cooperative" before "calculation".

[345:16-17] In 16.6 Collective subroutines, para 2, change
"in between executions of CHANGE TEAM and/or END TEAM statements" to
"between the execution of a CHANGE TEAM or END TEAM statement and
the next execution of a CHANGE TEAM or END TEAM statement".
[It is not clear whether the present wording covers the statements
between an END TEAM statement and a CHANGE TEAM statement.]
