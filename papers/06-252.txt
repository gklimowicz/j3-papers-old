Subject: Issue 40 : INQUIRE(TEAM=) and TEAM_IMAGES
Reference: J3/06-007


Discussion of Issue 40 (page 222)

Yes, it would be a good idea to add INQUIRE(TEAM=). For symmetry with 
OPEN, it should return a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM. We will need a null
value for the case where the unit or file is not connected.  Since the 
user will need to know the list of images involved, we also need to add 
an intrinsic that is given a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM and returns the 
list of image indices.

[249:14+] Add 
    <<or>> TEAM=<image-team>
    
[254:17+] Add
    9.9.1.30a TEAM= specifier in the INQUIRE statement
    
    The <image-team> in the TEAM= specifier is assigned the value of 
    the connect team or the value NULL_IMAGE_TEAM (13.8.3.5) if
    the file or unit is not connected. 
    
    Note 9.67a
    The indices of the images in a team may be obtained through the 
    intrinsic function TEAM_IMAGES (13.170a)
    [end Note]

    
[348:27+] Add
    TEAM_IMAGES(TEAM)    Indices of images in a team 
    
[432:18+] Add
    13.7.170a    TEAM_IMAGES(TEAM)
    
      <<Description.>> Returns the set of images in a team. 
            
      <<Class.>> Transformational function.
      
      <<Argument.>> TEAM shall be a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM 
      (13.8.3.5).
      
      <<Result Characteristics.>> Array of rank one, type default 
      integer, and size the number of images in the team specified
      by TEAM.
      
      <<Result Value.>> The result has value equal to the set of
      images in the team specified by TEAM.
      
     <<Examples.>> If the value of TEAM was defined by the statement
             CALL FORM_TEAM(TEAM,[1,2,3,4])
     the value of TEAM_IMAGES(TEAM) is [1,2,3,4]. The value of 
     TEAM_IMAGES (NULL_IMAGE_TEAM) is an array of size zero. 
     
[438:24+] Add a new sentence:

     NULL_IMAGE_TEAM is a value of type IMAGE_TEAM that identifies 
     a team with no images.
