Data subgroup wishes to reject the idea of pointers with the parameter
attribute. We have become very used to the idea that pointers are always
variables and cannot be constants. We believe that a lot of edits will
be needed to specify "pointer variables" where we now have "pointers"
and that the extra complication is not justified by the small extra
functionality (an alias for NULL(MOLD)), particularly when there are
so many other major issues to be resolved.

That components of derived-type constants may be pointers does not affect
this argument. This facility is needed for the sake of the non-pointer
components.
