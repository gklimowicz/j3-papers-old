1. Monday, August 14, 2006  8:00 AM
-----------------------------------

    The J3 meeting (#177) was called to order at 8:00 AM, Monday,
    August 14, 2006, at the Emerald Suites, Las Vegas, NV, USA,
    by the J3 chair, Dan Nagle.

1.1 Opening business                              D. Nagle

    The Chairman welcomed everyone.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair                     D. Nagle

    This is the first of three meetings to integrate/polish the final
    document.  Papers with edits against 06-007 will be processed by
    the three subgroups, each of whom processed one-third of 06-007.
    "UTI" means "Unresolved Technical Issue" as found in 06-007.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda                         D. Nagle

**  motion: Adopt the agenda as amended (moved by Bill Long/
            seconded by Van Snyder): passed by unanimous consent
            {uc}

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 176 minutes            D. Nagle

**  motion: Approve paper 06-183, the minutes of meeting #176
            (Whitlock/North): uc

1.1.4 INCITS/SDB report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    Dan sent 3 PowerPoint slide sets to NCITS to cover the J3
    annual report.  INCITS complained that Dan should have
    presented them in person.

    Debbie at INCITS can change the "representative" designation
    on member fee bills if the member's company balks at paying for
    a "representative".

    Dan attended most of the CT22 meeting: they are trying
    unsuccessfully to kill APL.  Cobol and C/C++ adopted a decimal
    floating-point data type but C/C++ wants to wait for 754r to
    decide what formats will be standardized.  INCITS can't affect
    the IEEE schedule or content.

    INCITS will vote in favor of J3's new work item and TR on C
    Interoperability.

    Having a standard for terms to be used for parallel processing
    was discussed but Fortran and C++ are already working on parallel
    processing so there won't be independent standard terminology.

    The SC22 Working Group on "Vulnerability due to Language
    Features" will meet next in London.  See the web site

      http://www.aitcnet.org/isai/Home.html

    about "ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/OWG:Vulnerabilities" for more info.
    Dan wants to contribute the suggestions on Fortran coding with
    J3's help.

1.1.5 ISO/WG5 report                             Van Snyder, IR

    ANSI wants the US TAG to approve the F2003 corrigendum #2.

1.1.6 J11 Liaison report (if any)                C. Rasmussen

    Craig wrote 06-280 "Removal of the restrict keyword in the
    C header file, FDesc.h" at the request of John Benino {J11} to
    send to WG14.

1.1.7 H2 Liaison report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    Nothing new to report.

1.1.8 IEEE 754 report (if any)                   M. Ingrassia

    Nothing new to report.

1.1.9 Treasurer's report                         M. North

    Opening balance is $2079.00.  There is a $50 meeting fee at this
    meeting.

**  motion: Exempt Aleks Donev, John Wallin, and Chris Rickett from
            this meeting's fee (North/Whitlock): uc

    organization at the Bank of America.

    Dan Nagle said the new J3 server is up at George Mason
