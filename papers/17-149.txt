Discussion:

Section 4.3.3 Fortran 2008 compatability, paragraph 4 reads:

 "Fortran 2008 permitted a pure statement function to reference a volatile
  variable, and permitted a local variable of a pure subprogram or of a
  BLOCK construct construct within a pure subprogram to be volatile..."

"BLOCK construct construct" should be "BLOCK construct".


Edits:

Section 4.3.3 Fortran 2008 compatability, p 4
  [30:32] Delete "construct" once.
