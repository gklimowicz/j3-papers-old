Introduction

C557 [88:5-7] requires the <scalar-int-expr> in a <data-implied-do>
[R528 87:29-30] to have primaries that are constants or subjects of
constants, or DO variables of containing <data-implied-do>s, and each
operation shall be intrinsic.  C561 poses a similar constraint for
subscripts.  Interestingly, C553, which is for <variable>s that are not
within <data-implied-do>s, the parallel requirement is posed in terms
of initialization expressions.

It would be simpler in standardese, and perhaps for processors as well, if
we reduced the number of expression patterns by requiring that those
expressions have to be initialization expressions.  Other constraints
(C553, C564, C567) are already posed in terms of initialization
expressions.

Delete C557 because the revised syntax covers it.


[88:12-15]
"C561 (R528) In an <array-element> or <scalar-structure-component> that is
a <data-i-do-object>, any subscript, substring starting point, or
substring ending point shall be an initialization expression."
