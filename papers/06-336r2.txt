Subject: Unresolved Issue 085: FORM_TEAM/TEAM_IMAGES polishing

UTI 85 (page 429) asks about the importance of the ordering in the
list of images for FORM_TEAM and TEAM_IMAGES. Note that for SYNC
IMAGES the list of images does not have to match and the order can
be different. The editor proposes that the order should not matter
for FORM_TEAM either, and that TEAM_IMAGES return an ordered list of
images. Subgroup agrees with the editor's recommendations.

While considering these issues we found several problems with the
FORM_TEAM description. In particular, the requirement that the image
calling FORM_TEAM be a member of the team is missing. Furthermore,
at meeting 177 it was pointed out that FORM_TEAM should handle
errors, especially in light of our changes to program termination
(some members of the team may have executed STOP). For this purpose,
an error flag argument should be added. Edits are provided below,
with the exact handling of STAT and ERRMSG arguments left to match
whatever is done for the SYNC statements.

Edits.

[379:39] Add two new optional arguments STAT and ERRMSG (in square
brackets).

[380:4+] In the second line of the description of IMAGES argument,
replace
"shall have the same value on all images of the team"
with:
"shall specify the same set of images on all images of the team."

[380:5-] Replace the last sentence of the IMAGES description "It
shall not have zero size" with:
"One of the elements shall have the value THIS_IMAGE()."

[380:5+] Add the descriptions of the new arguments:

STAT (optional)
shall be of type default integer and shall be a scalar. It is an
INTENT(OUT) argument. It is assigned the value -1 if any of the images
of the team has initiated image termination, or a processor-dependent
positive value if an error condition occurs. Otherwise it is assigned
the value 0.

ERRMSG (optional)
shall be of type default character and shall be a scalar. It is an
INTENT(INOUT) argument. If an error condition occurs, it is assigned
a processor-dependent explanatory message. Otherwise, it is unchanged.

[380:6-] Add a new paragraph before "Examples" [Note to editor: 
this should follow the paragraph added at [380:6-] in 06-321r2]:
"If an error condition occurs and STAT is not present, 
error termination occurs."

[380:9] Add a final sentence to the paragraph:
"The members of the team may be specified in a different order on
different images."

[429:27] Add a second sentence to the description of the Result Value:
Change "values are the image indices of the images" to "values are
the indices, in increasing order, of the images".
