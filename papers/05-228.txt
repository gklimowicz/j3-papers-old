STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

In 12.3.2.1.1 of Fortran 2003, at [262:8-9], the following is stated
about the dummy arguments of a function that defines an operation:
    The dummy arguments shall be nonoptional dummy data objects and
    shall be specified with INTENT (IN).

This clearly states that a dummy argument of such a function cannot be
a procedure pointer.  The same is not stated for the dummy arguments
of a subroutine that defines assignment.

Was it intended that procedure pointers should be allowed in defined
assignment, but not in defined operations?


ANSWER:

No.  It was not intended that procedure pointers should be allowed in
either defined assignment or defined operations.  An edit is provided
to correct this oversight.


EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[263:6]  Replace "Each argument shall be nonoptional." with
         "The dummy arguments shall be nonoptional dummy data objects."
