Subject: FINDLOC


A Public Comment for f03 requested a FIRSTLOC and a LASTLOC
pair of intrinsics to return the first or last elements evaluating
to true.  Paper 04-113 replaced that suggestion with FINDLOC, and included
a BACK= argument, similarly to the string search intrinsics.

The 167 Hate .. Love vote was 0 - 1 - 9 - 0.
This paper is a proposed "doneness" paper for FINDLOC.

This paper slightly generalizes the proposal by changing the search
for true by a search for a specified value of any intrinsic type.

Basic Functionality: Intrinsic returns location of first element containing
                     a specified value (which may be .true. or .false.),
                     searching from the first or last element of an array.

Rationale:  Considered in response to a public comment, this formulation
            is modeled on the MINLOC/MAXLOC procedures.  Rather than
            propose two procedures, a BACK= is proposed modeled after
            similar argument to the character search routines INDEX, SCAN,
            and VERIFY.  The BACK= is used to distinguish forward and
            backward searches, this may result is coding convenience
            or in more compact code.

Estimated Impact: The impact score was 3 on the John Reid scale at 167.

Detailed Specification: FINDLOC( ARRAY= <array> , VALUE= <s-e>
                        [, DIM= s-i-e, BACK= s-l-e, KIND= i-i-e])

                        <array> may be of any intrinsic TKR.
                        <s-e> shall be
                        a scalar and shall be == compatible with <array>,
                        or if both are logical.
                        <array> shall be an array.

                        DIM and KIND are defined as per MAXLOC and MINLOC.
                        DIM selects the dimension(s) to be scanned, KIND
                        sets the kind value of the result.

                        BACK is defined as per INDEX, SCAN, and VERIFY.
                        If present with the value of .TRUE., the array
                        search scans backwards from the last element
                        of the array, and the indices returned are those
                        of the last element whose value equals the <s-e>.

                        Returns the indices of the first element of <array>
                        where the value of an element is equal
                        to the scalar <s-e>
                        specified by the VALUE argument.  If <array> is
                        type logical, the test is
                        <array-element> .eqv. value.  Otherwise, the test
                        is <array-element> == value.

                        If BACK= is present and the s-l-e evaluates to
                        true, returns the index of the first element
                        whose value is <s-e> starting with the last element
                        and searching
                        backwards (so it returns the last element overall).

                        Example: given

                        integer, dimension( 3) :: i = [ 3, 5, 5]
                        integer, dimension( 1) :: idx
                        idx = findloc( i, value= 5)

                        assigns [2] to idx.

                        For symmetry, it may be desirable to add
                        a BACK= to MAXLOC and MINLOC.  However, this paper
                        does not propose to do so.
