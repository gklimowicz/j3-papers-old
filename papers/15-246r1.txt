Edits to 15-007r2:
==================

[175:7-9] 8.1.6.2 Form of a DO construct, split C817 into three
constraints as:

  "C817 A <variable-name> in a <locality-spec> shall be the name of a
        variable in the innermost executable construct or scoping unit that
        includes the DO CONCURRENT construct.

   C817a A <variable-name> that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality shall
         not be the name of an assumed-size array.

   C817aa A <variable-name> in a <locality-spec> shall not be the
          same as an <index-name> in the <concurrent-header> of the same
          DO CONCURRENT statement."

[175:9+] 8.1.6.2 Form of a DO construct, after C817 insert three new
         constraints:
  "C817b A <variable-name> that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality shall
         not have the INTENT(IN) attribute.

   C817c A <variable-name> that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality shall
         not be the name of an optional dummy data object in the
         innermost executable construct or scoping unit that includes the
         DO CONCURRENT construct.

   C817d A variable that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality shall not be a
         coarray or a coindexed object."

[178:13] 8.1.6.5 Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs,
para 2: Replace "variable with the same name outside the construct"
with "variable with the same name in the innermost executable
construct or scoping unit that includes the DO CONCURRENT construct."

[178:13] 8.1.6.5 Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs,
para 2: Replace ", and the outside variable" with " The variable in
the innermost executable construct or scoping unit that includes the
DO CONCURRENT construct".

[178:23] 8.1.6.5 Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs,
para 3, Replace "scoping unit" with "innermost executable construct or
scoping unit that includes the DO CONCURRENT construct".

[484:10] 16.4 Statement and construct entities, Insert the following
before "An entity": "A variable that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality
in a DO CONCURRENT construct is a construct entity. "

[484:33+] 16.4 Statement and construct entities, after p5, add a new
paragraph as:
"A variable that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality in a DO CONCURRENT
construct has the scope of the construct. It has the same type, type
parameters, rank, shape (if any), and attributes as the variable with
the same name in the innermost executable construct or scoping unit
that includes the DO CONCURRENT construct."
