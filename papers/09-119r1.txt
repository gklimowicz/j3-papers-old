Discussion

The units OUTPUT_UNIT and ERROR_UNIT on every image are preconnected to
the same file, in contradiction to para. 4 of 9.5.4. I suggest an edit.

With this change it is possible for a file to be connected to multiple
units again. As a consequence, the text in 08-007 at [216:15-17] needs
to be restored.

Edits to 09-007

[201:28+] At the end of the bullet list in para 2 of 9.3.3.2
Sequential access, add a new bullet item:

"Each record shall be read or written by a single image. The
processor shall ensure that once an image commences transferring the
data of a record to the file, no other image transfers data to the
file until the whole record has been transferred."


[207:27] In 9.5.4 Connection of a file to a unit, para 4, add at the
end of the first sentence:

", except that the unit identified by the value of the named constant
OUTPUT_UNIT of the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is preconnected to
the same file on all images and the unit identified by the value of
the named constant ERROR_UNIT of the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
is preconnected to the same file on all images".
