1. Introduction

The last sentence of paragraph 10 of 17.3 "The exceptions" is
redundant and incorrect (the function is not an inquiry function).
This should be deleted.

Comment GB-052 is accepted as is.

2. Edit to N2146

Page 446, 17.3 The exceptions, paragraph 10,
Delete "The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG can be used to inquire
        whether a particular flag is supported."
