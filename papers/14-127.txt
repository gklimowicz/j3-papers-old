Date: 2014 February 12

Item 2(i) of paper 14-117 states

(i) The current wording of C533 is slightly defective, as it does not
    clearly prohibit "REAL,DIMENSION(*) :: dummy,nondummy", seeing as
    how that does indeed declare "the array bounds of a dummy data
    object".  C533 should probably be reworded similarly to C534a.

Paper 14-117r1 correctly says that the specific example given here is
not a problem.  In a subsequent message, Malcolm said that he intended
the example to be "REAL, DIMENSION(10, *) :: dummy, nondummy", which
does exhibit the problem mentioned in item 2(i).  The following edit,
based on Malcolm's suggestion above, addresses that problem.

EDIT for 14-007

[98:8-9] Replace constraint C533 with

"C533 An object whose array bounds are specified by an
<assumed-size-spec> shall be a dummy data object."
