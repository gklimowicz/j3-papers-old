Subject: Add Note Re Fortran Target v. C Pointer Reference
Date: 26 Feb 02

As noted during the discussion of 137r1,
a Note should be provided to clarify the standard's terminology
regarding Fortran targets versus the memory whose address
a C pointer references.

Edits:

Paper 137r2 adds "C_F_POINTER" after 375:17.
The addition ends with a Note.  After that Note add another Note.

"Note   The term target in the description of C_F_POINTER
denotes the entity referenced by a C pointer type,
as described in section 6.2.5 of the C standard."
