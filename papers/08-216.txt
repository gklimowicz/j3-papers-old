Discussion

It is made clear (157: 7.2.2.3, para 2) that for data pointer
assignment, if the <data target> is a pointer with a target that is
not on the same image, the pointer association status of the
<pointer-data-object> becomes undefined. Note 7.46 explains that this
is intended to cover situations where data pointer association with a
target that is not on the same image might otherwise be implied. While
the intention is clear, the normative text does not cover situations
that are not defined in terms of pointer assignment, notably when a
coindexed actual argument has a pointer component.

To cover all situations, we think that it should be made clear in
16.5.2 that a data pointer can be associated only with a target that
is on the same image.

We also propose to add to 16.5.2.5 the case of a pointer component of
a coindexed actual argument to the list of ways that the association
status of a pointer may become undefined.


Edits to J3/08-007r2 (WG5/N1723):

[446] In 16.5.2.1 "Pointer association / General", para 1, line 2,
after "different targets" add "on its own image".

[448] In 16.5.2.5 "Events that cause the association status of pointers
to become undefined" and to the list:

"(13) the pointer is a data pointer ultimate component of a dummy
argument and the procedure is invoked with a coindexed object as the
corresponding actual argument.

(14) the pointer is a data pointer ultimate component of a coindexed
actual argument of a procedure invocation and the corresponding component
of the corresponding dummy argument is associated or disassociated when
execution of the procedure is completed."
