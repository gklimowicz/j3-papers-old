Subject: Signbit of NaN

NUMBER:  F03/0032
TITLE:  Sign bit of IEEE NaN
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, NaN, sign bit, negative
DEFECT TYPE: Contradiction ???
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

Do IEEE-754 NaNs have a sign bit?  Can they be negative?  Does a
sign bit imply a value can be either positive or negative?

DISCUSSION:

Fortran 2003 in 14.10.2 (IEEE_COPY_SIGN) says that NaNs have a
sign bit.  But, 14.10.10 (IEEE_IS_NEGATIVE) says NaNs are not
negative.  This appears to be a contradiction between two parts
of Fortran 2003.
