TITLE:    Polymorphic array constructors
KEYWORDS: polymorphic, array constructor
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

  FUNCTION f(dummy,n)
    CLASS(t) dummy
    TYPE(t) f(n)
    f = [ (dummy,i=1,n) ]
  END FUNCTION

(1) Is this standard-conforming?

(2) If so, is the array constructor polymorphic?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes.

(2) No.  Its declared and dynamic type are both T.
    An edit is provided to clarify this.

EDITS:

[67:21] "same type" -> "same declared type"

[68:9] "type and" -> "declared type and"

[68:14+] Insert new paragraph
  "The dynamic type of the array constructor is the same as its declared
   type."
