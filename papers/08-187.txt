1.  Introduction

This is a whack at interp F03/0076.  The outcome proposed here is the
same as in the original submission.  The answer is worded slightly
differently.  Edits are proposed to modify Fortran 2008 in the manner
suggested in the original submission.

2.  Original submission, sans advice to change F2008

========================================================================

NUMBER: F03/0076
TITLE: Scope of Fortran names of procedures with binding labels
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, dummy procedures
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following conforming:

module A
   interface
      subroutine CProc() bind(C,name="AnExternalCProcedure")
      end subroutine
   end interface
end module

module B
   interface
      subroutine CSub() bind(C,name="AnExternalCProcedure")
      end subroutine
   end interface
end module

ANSWER:

No, the fragment is not conforming. The name of an external procedure is
a global entity and is required to be unique. That is, the external C
procedure AnExternalCProcedure, must be given a unique Fortran name
inside a Fortran program.

EDITS:

None.

3.  Change (08-007r2) for consideration at m185

In [439: 16.2p1] replace the second "external procedure" with "external
procedure for which a binding label is not specified", replace "such
global entity" with "such entity" [this is cannonball polishing], and
replace "except ... program" with "except that the name of such an
entity may be the same as the name of an intrinsic module".

{Makes the Fortran name of an external procedure a global identifier
only if it doesn't have a binding label.}

In [440: 16.3.1p1(1)] append "external procedures for which a binding
label is specified," at the end of the item.

{Makes the Fortran name of an external procedure a local identifier if
it has a binding label.}

This is not a problem because a procedure that has a binding label is
required to have explicit interface (see 12.4.2.2p1(5)).
