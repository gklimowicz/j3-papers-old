---------------------

Discussion of issue 76 (page 492)

Issue 76 refers to item (12) in 16.6.5 Events that cause variables to
become defined [500:31]. The current wording covers all forms of
association, including association resulting from EQUIVALENCE and
COMMON. This is more than needed or desirable. The need is to ensure
that if a dummy argument of type bits is defined then a corresponding
actual argument that is not of type bits also becomes defined. For the
cases of matching dummy and actual argument types this requirement is
covered by item (12). A new sentence needs to be added to separately
cover the bits case.  This mirrors the case of undefinition in
[501:29-31].

Edits to J3/06-007r1

[500:31] Remove "or that are bits compatible"

[500:43+] Add a new paragraph as item (15a): "When a dummy argument of
type bits that is argument associated with an actual argument of a
different type becomes defined, the actual argument becomed defined."
