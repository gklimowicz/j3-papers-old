Discussion
----------

It was intended that SYNC TEAM be restricted in its effects to images
of the current team, but this is not clearly stated.

Edits to N1967:
---------------

[10:26-27] Change "team specified by the <team-variable>" to
"subteam of the current team that includes the executing image
and is specified by the value of <team-variable>.  The value of
<team-variable> shall have been established by an execution of
FORM SUBTEAM by the current team".
