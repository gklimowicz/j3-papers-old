Subject: Equals in macro actual arguments
Date: 2007 May 09

1. Introduction

This paper responds to 07-193.

2. Ambiguity

Subgroup resolved to fix the ambiguity by deciding that any macro actual
argument that begins "name=" is a keyword argument, thus "name" must be a
macro dummy argument name.  To pass an argument of "X=1", "dummy=X=1" is
required to be used.

3. Quoting

Subgroup was sympathetic to the usefulness of having argument quoting, but
preferred not to make such a significant syntax change at this point.

4. Edits to 07-007r1

[38:29+] Insert new constraint
  "C332a (R343) If the first two tokens of <macro-actual-arg-value> are a
	 name and an equals sign, <macro-dummy-name>= shall appear."
{Keyword= syntax takes precedence.}
