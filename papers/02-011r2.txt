Mallory, here is paper 02-011r2 for the server.

Everyone else, this is mostly for the archives.  I advise against wasting the paper to print it out unless you are tracking down historical records of the previously resolved issues.  The unresolved issue material actually relevant to meeting 162 is in the much shorter papers 02-210 and 02-211 sent out Friday.

PS to Mallory.  When checking the paper162.txt file to find the above paper numbers, I noticed that there is a typo that lists 02-211 as another 02-209.  This appears to be just in the paper162.txt file - the correct number is in the 02-211.txt istself.
