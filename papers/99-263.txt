Subject: Edits for IMPORT statement, plus host association fixups

1. Introduction

99-197r1 contains the specifications and syntax for the IMPORT statement, which
imports names into interface bodies (which normally do not access anything
from their host scoping unit).  This paper contains the edits.

2. Edits against 99-007r2

[9:40+] Insert
	"[ <import-stmt> ] ..."
{Add IMPORT statement to <specification-part> between the USE statements and
 the IMPLICIT statements}.

[14:5-] Insert "IMPORT statements" above "IMPLICIT NONE".

[14:24+] Insert table entry
  "IMPORT statement        No   No   No   No   No   No   Yes".

[264:46+] Insert
"R1207a <import-stmt> <<is>> IMPORT [ :: ] <import-name-list>
 Constraint: The IMPORT statement is allowed only in an <interface-body>.
 Constraint: Each <import-name> shall be the name of an entity defined in the
             enclosing scoping unit or accessible in the enclosing scoping
             unit."
{Syntax for the IMPORT statement, restrict it to interface bodies only,
 require imported items to be available in the "host" scoping unit.}

[266:18+] Insert
"The IMPORT statement specifies that the named entities in the enclosing
 scoping unit are accessible in the interface body by host association.
 Entities defined in the enclosing scope shall be explicitly declared prior to
 the interface body.  The name of an entity made accessible by an IMPORT
 statement may appear in no other specification statement that would cause any
 attribute of the entity to be specified in the interface body."
{Semantics for IMPORT.}

[369:34] After "procedures," insert "abstract interfaces,".
{Abstract interfaces should be inheritable via host association - they are
by use association already}.

[370:10+] Insert list item and renumber
"(10.1) The name of an abstract interface in an abstract interface block;"
{An abstract interface definition blocks host association.}
