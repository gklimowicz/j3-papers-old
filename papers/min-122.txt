            2.1  Meeting Objectives
                 1.  Process interpretations and update the S20
                 2.  Reply to the POSIX request (92-128)
                 3.  Generate the R&R document (S14)
            2.2  Adoption of the Final Agenda
                 Discussion Leader: Jerry Wagener
                 Discussion:
                   Weaver: New items should not wait until the last day.
                          People need time to go off and research them
                          further after their initial presentation.
                   Moss:  We should have a firm adjournment time, which
                          should appear on the published agenda.
                 Action: To approve the agenda as modified (see section
                         1); unanimous consent
            2.3  Approval of Meeting 121 Minutes
                 Discussion: Walt Brainerd's name is spelled incorrectly
                         several times.
                 Action: To approve the minutes with Walt's name
                         corrected; unanimous consent
            2.4  X3/BSR Report
                 Discussion Leader: Jerry Wagener
                 Fortran 90: The BSR is meeting this week and one of
                         their agenda items is the approval of Fortran
                         90.  They are scheduled to act on Fortran 90 on
                         Thursday.  An attempt will be made to report on
                         the results of that action Friday morning.
                 X3 Documents:   X3J3/92-133 is a list of X3 documents
                         which are of potential interest to X3J3
                         members.  It will include all relevant
                         standards actions.  Anyone desiring one of the
                         listed documents should contact Jerry.    If
                         there are no objections, this list will be
                         distributed at each meeting instead of
                         distributing each of the documents in its
                         entirety.
            2.5  Membership/Attendance Report
                 Discussion Leader: Maureen Hoffert
                 Discussion: There are currently 33 members, 27 of which
                         are present.  There are 4 members who will lose
                         their membership if they don't attend this
                         meeting.
            2.6  Treasurer's Report
                 Discussion Leader:  Mallory North
                 Discussion:
                   North: We have a balance of about $400 going into
                          this meeting but bonding fees for Jerry and
                          myself are $100 each.
                   Weaver: Doesn't CBEMA cover bonding expenses?
                   Ellis: We should get CBEMA to pay the bonding fees if
                          they are willing.
                   North: I'll look into this.
                 Motion: (Lauson/Moss) to accept the Treasurer's report
                 Action: motion passed by unanimous consent

            2.7  Comments from the Membership
                 Tait:   Fax numbers should be included in the
                         membership list section of the minutes.
                 Hoffert: It will be done next time.
                 Lauson: I would like to be excused from paying the
                         meeting fee.
                 Motion: (Lahey/Meissner) Excuse Hank Lauson from paying
                         the meeting fee.
                 Action: motion passed by unanimous consent.
                 Philips: As Alvin Mong will only be attending part of
                         the meeting, I would like to request that he
                         also be excused from paying the meeting fee.
                         [This was withdrawn after several members
                         objected.]
                 Hoffert: We need to address the issue of meeting
                         attendance.  Currently, a member is considered
                         as having attended the meeting if they show up
                         for part of one day.  I will put something on
                         the table at the next meeting.
                 Ellis:  If you are here at all, you should pay the full
                         fee.
                 Leonard: You should only have to pay the fee if you are
                         credited with having attended the meeting.
                 answer: These are quite different issues.  If you
                         attend any part of the meeting, you make use of
                         those things which the meeting fee is intended
                         to cover, e.g. copying expenses.
                 Rose:   There is a problem with not sending material to
                         alternates - it left me coming to this meeting
                         without the materials.
                 Wagener: We do make exceptions in the case of
                         alternates who attend regularly.

                 Weaver: I view email much like a phone conversation and
                         the cumulative email should not be published
                         and distributed at the meeting.
                 Tait:   All I am distributing is interpretations
                         related material.
                 Hirchert: Who is responsible for and what is the
                         purpose of the abridged FORTRAN 77 standard.
                 Weaver: I did this to help those who do not want to
                         carry the full FORTRAN 77 standard to the
                         meetings.
                 Hirchert: The email mailing list for interpretations is
                         intended to be informal.
                 Bierman: I would like to see a synopsis of the email
                         published but not all of it.  This will allow
                         us to ensure that all issues are addressed.
                 Leonard: I don't know which email messages to bring,  I
                         would request that formal proposals and
                         requests appear in the pre-meeting or
                         distributed at the meeting.
                 Weaver: There are no formal proposals in the email.
                 Ellis:  I assume that anything important will be
                         submitted on paper for the meeting.
                 Wagener: Perhaps we should revisit paper 92-027.
                 straw:  Andrew should provide a document containing all
                         of the email.  (13-12-5)
                 J. Martin: The email distribution is useful as Andrew
                         does provide some analysis of it.
                 Wagener: This discussion indicates that we need to look
                         for a better way, if there is one.
                 Weaver: What is the status of the procedures document?
                 Hoffert: It's ongoing.
            2.8  Subgroup Assignments
                 Tait:   Paper 92-123 lists the initial subgroup
                         assignments.  More assignments will be made
                         throughout the meeting.
            2.9  WG5 Reports
                 Discussion Leaders: Jerry Wagener, Jeanne Martin, and
                         Ivor Philips.

            2.9.2     Jeanne Martin's Report
                 References: 92-135
                 Discussion:
                   Leonard:     What is the publishing plan for the
                          revision or corrigenda?  An updated document
                          would be helpful for us in processing
                          interpretations.
                   J. Martin:   When you order the standard, you will
                          receive the corrigenda in addition to the
                          standard.
                   Wagener:     There are no plans as yet to create an
                          updated document although I would like to get
                          on with one as soon as possible.
                   Leonard:     We should create an updated working
                          draft after the corrigenda is done.
                   Meissner:    The issue of X3J3 only being
                          conditionally approved as the primary
                          development body should be a serious concern
                          to X3J3.  There was serious consideration
                          given by WG5 to not using X3J3 at all.  The
                          current state is a compromise, i.e. let's give
                          the X3 I-type project rules a chance.
                   Philips:     We should rewrite the document for the
                          revision and we should decide on the document
                          format, i.e. Tex, SGML, etc.
                   Hirchert:    There isn't time to rewrite the document
                          before 1995 although we may have to make some
                          changes in order to conform to the ISO style.
                   Moss:  I believe that the ISO rules allow the
                          publishing of an integrated document rather
                          than publishing the corrigenda separately.
                   Ellis: The ISO rules require that the document be
                          provided by the technical committee.
                          Therefore, they will publish whatever we give
                          them.
                   Weaver: WG5 considered forming a task group to be the
                          primary development body.  Their feeling was
                          that this task group would look much like
                          X3J3, but it would operate under ISO rules
                          instead of X3 rules.  John Hill and Bill
                          Rinehuls should be informed of this.
                   Leonard:     If such a task group were formed, rules
                          would have to be established for it in order
                          to protect the vendors in the same way that
                          the ANSI/X3 rules do today.
                   Ellis: All major vendors already work on
                          international standards and they wouldn't if
                          there weren't rules in place.  WG5's desire is
                          for the primary development body to operate
                          under one set of rules.  The X3 I-type project
                          rules should do this.  WG5 recognizes that
                          X3J3 has the technical expertise and the
                          financial support to do the work.










                                          8


                   Bierman:     Working as a task group of WG5 saves the
                          time spent explaining X3J3 rules to WG5 and
                          WG5 rules to X3J3.  At the WG5 meeting, Lawrie
                          Schonfelder wondered why the US was special,
                          i.e. why should any national body develop an
                          international standard.
                   Meissner:    We must start thinking about what to do
                          if an I-type project is not in place by
                          6/30/93.
                   Philips:     We are probably exaggerating our concern
                          here as X3 has other I-type projects in place
                          and they seem to be working well.  WG5 was
                          also concerned that X3 may change the rules
                          mid-project as they did last time.
            2.9.3     Ivor Philips' Report
                 Philips: It was a very positive meeting.  [Ivor
                         reviewed the strategic plan and the resolutions
                         which are most important to X3J3.  He also
                         brought up the issues of Pointer
                         initialization, Pointer bounds, and the
                         deletion of features in the next revision.]
                 Wagener: [Jerry read resolution V9, the request for
                         X3J3 to be the primary development body
                         operating under I-type project rules by
                         6/30/93, as the printed copy won't  be
                         available until later in the day.]  I will be
                         discussing the facts contained in the
                         resolutions with X3.  I will also reference
                         written items from these minutes and Jeanne's
                         report.  We must decide this week if we are
                         going to do ahead with this and begin preparing
                         a SD-3 project proposal based on this
                         resolution.
                 Moss:   The pointer nullification issue is not an item
                         for a technical corrigenda but rather is an
                         item for the revision.
                 Bierman: WG5 expects X3J3 to review this issue.  They
                         would probably accept the decision of X3J3
                         regarding whether of not this is an item for a
                         technical corrigenda or for a revision.
                 Meissner: Our new SD-3 should provide for the possible
                         deletion of features.
                 Weaver: I discussed with both Lawrie Schonfelder and
                         Wolfgang Walter the possibility of  providing a
                         user option to indicate whether or not pointers
                         are to be initialized.  I would like to
                         downsize the language by removing constraints,
                         i.e. extending the language in a natural way.
                 J. Martin: [Jeanne described the amendment procedure
                         and indicated that it would take longer than a
                         revision.]  If we did an amendment before a
                         revision, we would have to amend 2 standards:
                         the ANSI Fortran 90 standard and the ISO
                         Fortran standard.

            2.10 X3H5 Report
                 Wagener: I have asked Jon Steidel to put together a
                         parallel processing subgroup and to lead that
                         group.  Keith Bierman will be a member and will
                         be the X3H5 liaison.  This group will be
                         responsible for interfacing with both X3H5 and
                         HPFF.
                 Bierman: X3H5 is now balloting their model document to
                         determine if it is ready to go out for public
                         review.  The FORTRAN 77 binding has been
                         withdrawn.  At this point, X3 has only approved
                         the project to develop the model document.
                         Their current active membership is 12 or 13.
            2.11 POSIX
                 Reference: 92-128
                 Wagener: We will vote on some response to the request
                         later this week.  Joanne Brixius has served  as
                         our liaison to the FORTRAN 77 bindings and is
                         willing to do so for the Fortran 90 bindings.
                 Weaver: I was at the last .9 meeting and was 1/3 of the
                         attendees.
                 Wagener: We should ask to be the IEEE equivalent of the
                         coordinating liaison.
                 Weaver: At the meeting, the group was receptive to the
                         idea of a Fortran 90 module but all of  their
                         anticipated feature cannot be contained in a
                         module..  They anticipate the point at which
                         they will need extensions to the Fortran
                         language.  In particular, they will probably
                         need some extensions in the I/O area.
                 Hoffert: I spoke to the head of the US TAG to the POSIX
                         Working Group and he indicated that a
                         coordination point could be established which
                         allows us to approve the bindings document.
                         The coordination point can require a
                         coordination ballot.  We should review the work
                         as it proceeds rather than just being in the
                         position to reject or approve their work when
                         they send it out to their balloting group.
                 Philips: John Hill had asked me to give coordinating
                         information to the POSIX WG.
                 Hoffert: Jeanne Adams was required to send a letter
                         indicating that we had coordinated with .9 in
                         the development of the FORTRAN 77 bindings.
                 Bierman: Dick Weaver should be our liaison to .9
                         instead of Joanne Brixius.
                 Leonard: Instead of .9 developing extensions to
                         Fortran, they should submit a list of
                         requirements to the appropriate X3J3 technical
                         subgroup which will draft the specifications.
                 Weaver: You should note that the Fortran 90 binding is
                         referred to as 1003.19, but the committee is
                         still called 1003.9.  Rather than raise issues

                         as to who should do what work, we should work
                         with them.
            2.12 Electronic Processing
                 Hirchert: I am in the process of setting up an FTP
                         server.  Email will be sent out when it is
                         ready.

            3.3  HPF Report
                 Discussion Leader: Ken Kennedy
                 Scribe: Jeanne Martin
                 Reference: 92-146 High Performance Fortran Forum
                 Discussion:
                   Leonard:     What do you mean by node?
                   Ans:   I prefer to factor out the operating system
                          and think of processors.
                   ---    Could a node be a UNIX process or thread?
                   Ans:   Yes, but some people would be horrified; they
                          think of actual processors in a multi
                          processor system.
                   ---    It would be possible to construct threads in
                          an operating system to control processes.
                   Ans:   The proposed extensions could be implemented
                          that way, but the language makes assumptions
                          that there will be processors implementing a
                          data parallel program.  The implementation you
                          suggest is not precluded.
                   Oglesby:     Could you say more about the Fortran 90
                          subset?
                   Ans:   It would include the array sublanguage,
                          procedure interfaces, and syntactic extensions
                          such as long names and ! for comments.  There
                          is some question about modules.  There are two
                          factions.  One is in favor of basing the HPF
                          extensions on the full Fortran 90 language,
                          but  the other, more transition-oriented
                          faction, is winning out.  They fear that it
                          would take too much time as there may be some
                          implementation difficulty with modules.  The
                          final decision on modules and the subset will
                          be made in October.
                   Hendrickson: How portable will this be?  The Thinking
                          Machines connection machine is quite different
                          from the Cray YMP.  The directives will work,
                          but will the program be high performance?
                   Ans:   Fortran-D tried to address this.  We have run
                          tests on both TM and Intel machines and our
                          extensions appeared to accommodate both
                          targets with great efficiency.  There were a
                          variety of tests; 50% of our tests specify
                          regular array distributions and 40% specify
                          irregular array distributions.
                   Meissner:    Will it be necessary to redo the
                          mappings when moving to a new architecture?
                   Ans:   Yes.  Again we have some experience along this
                          line with Fortran D
                   Shepherd:    Do you plan to provide a document on how
                          to use the language?
                   Ans:   A number of documents have been or will be
                          produced by research organizations.  Due to
                          our accelerated schedule, I am reluctant to

                          ask for more from the current participants of
                          HPFF.
                   Lahey: We are a standards body.  Your goals are to
                          get similar implementations.  Has your group
                          agreed to provide them?
                   Ans:   The group includes implementers in Japan and
                          Europe - not just the US.  There is no
                          commitment to produce similar implementations,
                          and there will probably be variations, but we
                          believe there are solid economic reasons for
                          making the implementations similar.
                   Moss:  You are proposing to accommodate sequence and
                          storage association which we all know are
                          undesirable.  If you let them in now, they
                          will be there forever.
                   Ans:   We are ready to accept that.
                   ---    Are you planning a large number of intrinsics?
                   Ans:   Our strategy is to minimize the number of new
                          intrinsics.
                   ---    I second that strategy; there are already too
                          many in Fortran 90.
                   Ans:   We will need a few that are necessary for
                          parallel applications.
                   Martin, J:   It is our intention to produce a short
                          term revision including corrections and
                          clarifications to Fortran 90 and perhaps a few
                          extensions in the 1995-1996 time frame.  Would
                          your group like to see some of your
                          extensions, such as FORALL, included in this
                          revision.
                   Ans:   Yes, very much.  We are not going to
                          standardize anything.  We have been careful to
                          follow the Fortran 90 declarative syntax rules
                          for our proposed directives.
                   Meissner:    Are you concerned about antitrust
                          considerations?
                   Ans:   We have tried to make our process as open as
                          possible and we need to keep it open.  There
                          is a limit on the number of representatives
                          from one organization.  Also, in order to get
                          the work done, we have limited the attendance
                          to those who are committed to really working
                          hard.
                   Oglesby:     What is your relationship with the X3H5
                          work?
                   Ans:   We do not conflict with X3H5 proposals except
                          for DO INDEPENDENT so we are not inconsistent.
                          One could have both kinds of parallelism in
                          the same code.
                   Shepherd:    Can the distribution directives be
                          applied to allocatable arrays and pointers.
                   Ans:   The distribution subgroup is looking at that.
                   ---    Do you anticipate there being a second round
                          once your initial proposal is completed in









                                         13


                          1993.  Will there be a revision in 1994?  If
                          not, how do you plan to resolve requests for
                          interpretation and clarification.  Each
                          implementer might implement a feature in a
                          slightly different way: DEC might do it one
                          way, Cray another, Convex or SSI another.  To
                          accept any code, a compiler might have to have
                          three switches.
                   Ans:   Apart from FORALL, the language consists of
                          directives.  Take those away and the code
                          would be Fortran 90 conforming.  The rest is
                          optimization.  If there is no one to answer
                          interpretation and clarification questions, it
                          might fall on the people in this room.  The
                          authors of the HPF document could always be
                          asked.
                   Weaver: To have the program defined by Fortran 90
                          with directives is a powerful position.  The
                          important thing is portability.  If there were
                          things you wanted to do but couldn't, could
                          you tell us what they are?  You have
                          considerable expertise, so after your December
                          meeting, perhaps you could take the time to
                          tell us what we should add or change.  But
                          more immediately, what does parallel prefix
                          mean?
                   Ans:   This came from an MIT thesis.  An example
                          would be partial sums - using lexical scanning
                          in parallel to produce all partial sums.  A
                          modified form of parallel prefix could be used
                          to compute anything.
                   Wagener:     Is REALIGNABLE a required attribute if
                          an array is ever to be realigned?
                   Ans:   Yes, otherwise you could build incorrect
                          programs.  The attribute is needed on both
                          sides of a call.  Without interprocedural
                          analysis, incorrect programs may result.
                   ---    I understand INDEPENDENT is a directive before
                          a loop.  Has that been adopted?
                   Ans:   The first reading of that proposal was at the
                          last HPFF meeting.  It has not passed yet, but
                          the majority wanted it so it will be in the
                          proposal.
                   ---    One should not think of these as loops; it is
                          a disservice to the community to call these
                          loops because the directive changes a loop
                          into a dramatically different animal.  I
                          consider it poor language design.  Is it still
                          being discussed?
                   Ans:   Yes, it is being discussed.  I am opposed.
                          Some want loops with procedure calls in them
                          because they have already been implemented.  I
                          am personally concerned about that; it leads
                          to a major source of nondeterminism.  You can

                          send comments to Chuck Koelbel or another
                          member of the committee.
                   ---    I would like to consider the desirability or
                          possibility of more effective teamwork between
                          your group and ours.  This group is
                          responsible for Fortran-related standards and
                          your group is doing one.  It is pioneering
                          work that is not appropriate for a standards
                          organization, but it would be beneficial to
                          the entire Fortran community for us to work
                          together on some informal basis.
                   Ans:   I am here.  Some X3J3 members and alternates
                          are active in HPFF.  We are open to other
                          things.
                   ---    There would be more of us participating if we
                          had the time.  Could you tell us what is
                          critical - what is needed by a certain date?
                   Ans:   How many of you are on our email nets?  [Many
                          hands]
                   Moss:  How many read it?  [Fewer hands]
                   Ans:   We would be happy to have any kind of
                          communication that works.  We are attempting
                          to progress rapidly.
                   ---    We have an official interaction with X3H5
                          where our review of their work is binding.
                          One thing we could do is review the HPF
                          proposal.
                   Ans:   You could get it in postscript form through
                          anonymous FTP.  We need quick feedback.  We
                          did not originally intend to submit our
                          proposals to real standards bodies.
                   Moss:  Another method would be to arrive at important
                          issues and take straw polls.  Ask us what we
                          think.  Our next meeting is in November.
                   Ans:   That might be useful.
                   ---    You could put the directives paper in our
                          distribution.  Our advice may be of help.
                   Ans:   Absolutely.  If we could set it up so we could
                          just take away the comment part; that would
                          make sense.
                   Martin, B.   I endorse Weaver's comments.  What will
                          happen with your proposal eventually?
                   Ans:   It will be published in some form that could
                          be the starting point for real
                          standardization.
                   ---    Could it be submitted as an ANSI or ISO
                          document of some sort? Perhaps a technical
                          report.
                   Lahey  I suggest you use SIGPLAN.  I would like to
                          invite you to our February 1993 meeting in Ft.
                          Lauderdale.
                   Ans:   Sounds great.  Someone could come, perhaps
                          Dave Loveman or someone else.
                   Weaver: What do HPF directives look like?









                                         15


                   Ans:   !HPF$ or CHPF$
                   ---    Must that be the initial item on a line?
                   Ans:   Yes.
                   Hoffert:     There is an ambiguity with the
                          REALIGNABLE keyword when fixed form (with
                          insignificant blanks) is used.
                   Wagener:     I understand you plan to have a final
                          draft in December.  Could there be an
                          unapproved preliminary draft in late October?
                          We could review that.
                   Ans:   I hope to do that.  We will make an effort to
                          get a document out and review any feedback
                          which you can send to HPF members.
                   ---    We have a two week rule.  Our meeting is
                          November 9-13 so we would need for the
                          document to be available via email by October
                          22 or 23 (approximately 2 and 1/2 weeks before
                          the meeting.
                   Ans:   We will have something.  It may not reflect
                          all decisions.  I will commit to having
                          something - not necessarily the final
                          document.
                 Motion: (Weaver/B. Martin) I move that our Chair draft
                         a letter to the HPF committee, noting their
                         expertise, and suggesting that they point out
                         any changes to Fortran 90 that would be of
                         benefit to all.  The letter should outline our
                         schedule and suggest the latest date when
                         responses from HPF would be most useful.  An
                         agenda item should then be added to the
                         following X3J3 meeting to follow up on any
                         suggestions.
                 Action: motion passed by unanimous consent
                 Chair:  I will draft a letter and put it on the table
                         at this meeting if it is done in time.
                         Excellent idea!
            3.4  Appointment of the X3J3 Representative to the WG5
                 Management Committee
                 Wagener: I appoint Maureen Hoffert to be our
                         representative.
            3.5  Interpretations Procedures
                 Discussion Leader: Andrew Tait
                 Scribe: David Philimore
                 References: X3J3/92-121 (Minutes of meeting #121)
                         92.27 (Wagener. Interim Interpretation
                         Procedures)
                 Discussion:
                   Tait:  There seems to be uncertainty in X3J3 on the
                          processing of interpretations. Each
                          interpretation will require a roll call vote.
                          We should continue to add items to the S20 -
                          if X3J3 preferred, we could use a straw vote.
                          But there will be a roll call vote at the next










                                         16


                          meeting before items are forwarded to WG5.
                          This is an ambitious, but possible, schedule.
                   Leonard:     Favors a two stage process, in more
                          detail: the roll call vote is good, but the
                          first stage should be a formal vote, not a
                          straw vote, then we should roll call for final
                          approval. There was a suggestion of adding
                          items if there are no objections - there
                          should be no doubt of X3J3's formal approval.
                          Straw votes are informal.
                   Wagener:     A letter ballot is an alternative to the
                          roll call vote.
                   Leonard:     There have been observations that it is
                          difficult to turn interpretations around in
                          one meeting. X3J3 should balance speed and
                          accuracy - a turnaround in two meeting seems
                          adequate. People waiting for the answer can in
                          general proceed on the basis of informal
                          assessment and approval by X3J3.
                   Moss:  Some form of two stage process seems
                          desirable. Would be happy to accept Tait's
                          proposal. The status field entries in S20 need
                          to be expanded to reflect the stage of the
                          process.

                          What is the status of email? It seems
                          valuable:- the result of an interpretation has
                          often gelled there. The email compendium
                          gathered by Tait is useful background
                          material, but we should be tracking formal
                          interpretation requests and not items in email
                          which might be construed as requests. We don't
                          have time to track email. It seems that 99% of
                          the potential interpretation requests on email
                          have been turned into formal requests. The
                          email tracking is slowing down processing of
                          formal requests. Request that only formal
                          requests be tracked.
                   Meissner:    Agrees with Moss. My email requests were
                          just requests for information and not for
                          interpretation.

                          Seconds letter ballot procedure. There is not
                          always an overlap of attendance at meetings -
                          a letter ballot may give more consistent
                          responses - individuals are not always up to
                          speed on a topic at a given meeting.
                   Bierman:     X3J3 started by doing interpretations on
                          the standard - it's possible        to read
                          the language in the WG5 documents such that we
                          may do corrections to the standard in order to
                          produce corrigenda. For example     my vote on
                          the interpretation on the permissibility of
                          printing a negative zero depends on whether we









                                         17


                          are producing interpretations or corrections.
                          (i.e, Yes, if an interpretation - the standard
                          does say that. No, if a correction - I think
                          it is a mistake not to be able to print -0.0).
                          The intent of X3J3 sometimes changed; that is
                          why we are revisiting many of these issues.
                   Lahey: Don't know if it was the intent of X3J3 to
                          allow negative zeroes, sometimes seems the
                          intent changes. Would like to know how the
                          interpretation processing stands & propose a
                          motion that Tait should provide a summary of
                          the processing at the start and end of each
                          meeting.
                 Motion: (Lahey/O'Gara) An inventory of interpretations
                         should be provided at the start and at the end
                         of each meeting.
                   Discussion on the motion:
                     Moss:      Does Tait think this is difficult to
                                provide?
                     Tait:      It should be easy. 92.121 says there
                                were 69 open issues  - 18 more have just
                                been added. There are a few from  WG5 to
                                be added.
                 Action: Motion passed by a vote of (21-0)
                 Discussion (continued):
                   B Martin:    Seconds the idea that email is useful,
                          but not the final submission. X3J3 can't
                          consider each item of email. It seems the
                          input procedures for X3J3 to consider an
                          interpretation need to be better - when do
                          informal requests become formal requests, for
                          instance.
                   Hirchert:    PROC subgroup has certainly wasted time
                          chasing about 6 phantom issues in email.
                   Moss:  To answer B Martin. The WG5 procedures
                          (assuming we are publishing a corrigendum),
                          that is the ISO rules, want a Defect
                          Management document and index. The procedures
                          say that any member of WG5 (or its editing
                          body X3J3) can register a request for
                          interpretation by sending it to the defect
                          document editor. i,e, we send something to
                          Tait. This could be applied to the public as
                          well.
                   J Martin:    We don't need a motion to decide on the
                          form. the Defect document editor (Tait)
                          stipulates what may be required of a request.
                   Meissner:    A formal request should have a
                          particular form.
                   Tait:  Formal mechanisms exist one can write to the
                          Chair, to the Defect document editor (me), to
                          X3. If not in the US, then the ISO form L14
                          can be used. The procedures are explicit.










                                         18


                          This is all fine - if we were restricted to
                          these rules there would be little work to do.
                          There is much dispute in email a consensus is
                          often reached after several weeks and no
                          formal request gets into the S20. Believes it
                          is important that this consensus and
                          discussion gets into the S20 so those that
                          don't have email can see the discussion. We
                          should not ignore this, to do a good job,
                          however if X3J3 wants to ignore the email,
                          then will do what X3J3 wants.
                   Steidel:     There are ways to get a formal request
                          from email, and the discussion and do Tait's
                          good job. Interpretations have changed because
                          of email discussion - what is discussed in
                          email needs to be carried forward, perhaps by
                          subgroup, to bring the information out. Few
                          can disagree with the formal papers.
                   Tait:  Subgroups can look through the email and
                          decide if work is to be done. We don't have to
                          interpret and respond to everything.
                   Leonard:     Tait did a good job with the email
                          compendium - it is all useful input. Email is
                          the only way to get to the public, but if
                          someone requires an official response, then
                          they must submit a formal request. Standards
                          are not easy reading, and often need a lot of
                          effort. Much of the public review comment was
                          a question that could be answered by the
                          standard's text. Responses can be of the form
                          - 'Yes, it does say that'. If we track all
                          email we will get bogged down - synopsis of
                          email discussions would be useful.
                   Moss:  Responding to Tait.  I'm not advocating that
                          email should be ignored - there is a
                          responsibility there. Each X3J3 member is
                          individually responsible for paying attention.
                          We must get to issues raised by formal
                          requests - will probably miss some on email,
                          but we we have limited resources.
                   Weaver: Email provides a useful view of X3J3 - others
                          may best be served by registering as
                          observers. They will get X3J3 mail then.
                   Maine: Agrees with Tait. Don't ignore email - there
                          is a responsibility to monitor email. A formal
                          request could be submitted by email, or issues
                          on email which merit interpretation should be
                          written up as a formal requests for
                          interpretation. Ignoring them is avoiding
                          responsibility, but we don't need the mass of
                          email.
                   Meissner:    It's unusual for X3J3 to be in this mode
                          - there is a lull in the workload, there is no










                                         19


                          future work yet - so that it can spend an
                          entire meeting processing interpretations.

                          Undecided on suggestion that subgroups chase
                          around correlating and tracking email. There
                          seems to be other work e.g, WG5 comments
                          formally on NULLIFY statement, and it doesn't
                          seem to be listed in the open issues and can't
                          be responded to until X3J3 considers it.
                   Bierman:     Who distils the email? Subgroup, plenary
                          committee? Who will ask folks answering
                          questions to form them more tightly, or if
                          they are happy with the response? We can
                          formulate answers to these questions.
                   Oglesby:     Seconds Bierman's comments.
                   Mattoon:     Email answers can be long and confusing
                          - one person may disagree with one detail of
                          the answer while agreeing with the rest.
                          Perhaps the email originator who disagrees
                          with a detail of a point by point response
                          should submit a formal request.
                   Tait:  It seems X3J3 doesn't want the all of the
                          email compendium and that individuals on X3J3
                          will submit formal requests distilled from
                          email.
                   Wagener:     Hearing several arguments we have had
                          before - similar to the the interim procedures
                          suggested in 92-027. It seems X3J3 has come to
                          a consensus which is not dissimilar.
                   Moss:  How do subgroups proceed for this meeting?
                   Wagener:     Subgroups will have to use judgement.
                 Chair's Ruling: The procedures in effect are those
                         specified in 92-027.
            3.6  Interpretations Processing - August 5
                 Discussion Leader: Andrew Tait
                 Weaver: I object to papers being placed on the table
                         which are revisions of papers from the last
                         meeting and which are given numbers from that
                         meeting instead of  for this meeting.  Do I put
                         these papers with this meeting's papers or last
                         meeting's papers?
            3.7  Response to the POSIX Request
                 Discussion Leader: Jerry Wagener

                 Discussion: [Several edits were suggested.  The
                         response will be revised and brought back
                         later.]
            3.8  SD-3 for the Next Revision of Fortran
                 Discussion Leader: Jerry Wagener
                 References: 92-142
                 Wagener: This paper represents the start of our new SD-
                         3.  I am looking for help in creating the
                         entries for this.
                 Bierman: We should find a way to have one corrigenda.









                                         20


                 Wagener: I believe that we can release an ANSI document
                         which just points to the ISO corrigenda and
                         this will serve as the ANSI corrigenda.
                 Hirchert: Is Fortran 95 an appropriate project title?
                         The ISO project is titled Fortran and we should
                         title ours the same.
                 Moss:   The current SD-3 rules describe I-type project
                         as if the US is initiating an international
                         project.  We should call the appropriate people
                         to determine if there are any special
                         requirements in our case.  In section 5 we
                         should list X3H5, HPF, etc.
                 Weaver: The fact the ISO/IEC SC22/WG5 has delegated the
                         project to X3J3 should be noted.
                 J. Martin: We should note that the project is shared;
                         X3J3 is only doing the development.
                 Wagener: We should note that an ISO project already
                         exists.
                 Leonard: If at all possible, we should get this to
                         SPARC for their next meeting.
                 Lahey:  I would like you to quote WG5 resolution V9 in
                         this.
                 B. Martin: We should call the project Fortran 95.  We
                         started this trend with FORTRAN 77.  Section
                         5.1 should list the ISO standards and not just
                         the ANSI ones.
                 Lahey:  We should put a year in the title, but it
                         should be as accurate as possible.
                 Wagener: I must look into the procedure to determine if
                         we need a letter ballot to forward this to
                         SPARC.
            3.9  Compiler Directives
                 Discussion Leader: Dick Weaver
                 References: 92-124
                 Weaver: It was good to see HPF using this format.
                 Bierman: We should not be doing this - we should be
                         trying to stamp out directives.
                 Maine:  I like the idea but I disagree with mucking up
                         the comment syntax.
                 Hoffert: We should look at the work done previously at
                         the implementation symposia.
                 Tait:   I disagree with Keith; it is a well established
                         practice for Fortran.
                 Lahey:  I would like a special character for column 1
                         to indicate directives.
                 Weaver: I will send this to David Muxworthy for
                         inclusion in the WG5 bindings document.
                 Bierman: The current approach is inconsistent between
                         implementations and is not portable.

                                         21


                 Weaver: The response to V11 should indicate the
                         willingness of Jerry and Jeanne to work
                         together to establish the correct procedures in

                    This looks like a revision of FORTRAN 77 and you
                    can't approve this unless you withdraw the FORTRAN
                    77 standard.

                   + Fortran 90 is currently undergoing a letter ballot
                    within ANSI which closes on August 28.  If there are
                    no negative ballots, it automatically becomes a
                    standard.
