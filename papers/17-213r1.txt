The image selectors in C.6.7 are invalid because they use TEAM_NUMBER
but reference a coarray that is an associating entity. This is not
permitted by the rules in 9.6.

We could change the image selectors in C.6.7 to reference the original
coarray. The lines would become
      A (:, 10) = A (:, 1)[1, 1, TEAM_NUMBER=UR]
and
      A (:, 10) = A (:, 1)[2, 1, TEAM_NUMBER=UR]
While the revised statements are simple, data exchanges across other
boundaries would be awkward because we are using the cobounds [4,*]
to address a coarray on a 2x2 grid. We believe that it was always
intended to allow an associating entity in an image selector that uses
TEAM_NUMBER, that is, for the example to work. A change to 9.6 will
allow this. The symmetric memory aim (NOTE 5.11) is met because
[188:12] says "Each selector shall be an established coarray when the
CHANGE TEAM statement begins execution.".

[139:33] In 9.6 Image selectors, para 3, after "ancestor of the current
team", add ", or an associating entity of the CHANGE TEAM construct."

[562:41+] At the end of C.6.7 Accessing coarrays in sibling teams, add
explanatory text:

"Because the selector for a coarray association in a CHANGE TEAM is
required to be established when the statement is executed (11.1.5.2),
the associating entity will have the same type, type parameters and
bounds on all the images of the sibling teams. This allows the use of
TEAM_NUMBER in an image selector to address the corresponding coarray
in a sibling team."
