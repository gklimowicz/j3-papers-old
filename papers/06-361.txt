Subject: Issue 39: unit connection and teams
Reference: J3/06-007r1, J3/06-251


Discussion of issue 39 (page 214)

We agree that whether or not a unit is connected with a team is not
relevant to the basic property of connection, and thus the discussion
of teams in the first paragraph of 9.4.3 is a distraction.

Edits to J3/06-007r1

[214:3] In the second sentence of 9.4.3 Connection of a file to a
unit, delete ", and the connection is for a team of images".
