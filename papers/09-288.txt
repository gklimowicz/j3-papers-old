1.1 Opening Business

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair

   Dan Nagle (J3 chair) welcomed everyone to the meeting and started
   working through the J3 Agenda.  Our goal this week is to finish
   work on the draft Fortran 2008 Standard.

   The J3 server was down due to a network outage on the George Mason
   campus.  John Wallin and others are working to get us on-line as
   soon as possible.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda

** motion: adopt agenda (Whitlock/Snyder) as amended to remove the US
           TAG meeting on Thursday: uc

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 188 minutes

** motion: approve 09-235r2 minutes of meeting 188 as amended
           (Snyder/Whitlock): uc

1.1.4 INCITS/OMC report - Dan Nagle

   Dan made available a copy of ISO 8601-2004, the date and time
   standard we reference in F2008.

   As always, Dan drew everyone's attention to the anti-trust
   guidelines at www.incits.org/inatrust.htm and the patent
   guidelines at http://www.incits.org/pat_slides.pdf .

1.1.5 SC22/WG23 report - Dan Nagle

   Ada, C, and Fortran have all produced first drafts of vulnerability
   annexes.  WG23 adopted a standard format for these annexes.  The plan
   is to have the final vote on TR 24772 after their April-2010 meeting.
   Then in about a year, WG23 will produce a revision containing the
   language annexes.  They want to produce a separate standard for each
   language annex.

1.1.6 ISO/WG5 report - Van Snyder

   Nothing to report

1.1.7 J11 Liaison report - Craig Rasmussen

   Nothing to report

1.1.8 MPI Liaison report - Craig Rasmussen

   The Fortran/MPI interaction work is complete - the target is to have
   papers on it at SuperComputing 2010.

   It was suggested that the Fortran/MPI information exchange be a
   superset of the WG5 mailing list.

1.1.9 UPC Liaison report - Dan Nagle

   There may be a PGAS conference in Fairfax, VA, in October, 2009.  John
   Wallin would speak on coarrays.  There is light interest so far so it may
   not happen.  PGAS is an IEEE standard.

1.1.10 Treasurer's report - Van Snyder

   Account balance same as at the end of meeting 188 == $1942.84 (See 09-234)
