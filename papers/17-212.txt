Subject: Duplicate restriction on assumed-size
Date: 2017 October 05

Discussion:

At two places in the standard we have requirements for the need to
specify an upper limit in the last dimension of a section of an
assumed-size array.

In 8.5.8.5 Assumed-size array (part of the DIMENSION attribute
subclause) at [106:35-36] we have

"The upper bound shall not be omitted from a subscript
triplet in the last dimension."

In 9.5.3 Array elements and array sections, there is a constraint on
array sections at [136:6-7] that says basically the same thing:

"C927 (R921) The second subscript shall not be omitted from a
subscript-triplet in the last dimension of an assumed-size array."

The sentence before the sentence at [106:35-36] includes a cross
reference to 9.5.3.3, whereas the constraint at [136:6-7] is in
9.5.3.1. The proposal is to modify the sentence before the [106]
sentence and delete the redundant sentence.

Edits to N2137:
---------------

[106:35] In 8.5.8.5 Assumed-size array, para 5, replace

 "may be subscripted or sectioned (9.5.3.3)"

with

 "can be subscripted or sectioned (9.5.3)"


[106:35-36] IN 8.5.8.5 Assumed-size array, para 5 delete the final
sentence which reads "The upper bound shall not be omitted from a
subscript triplet in the last dimension."
