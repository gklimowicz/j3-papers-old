Subject: delete obsolete DO forms UK-10.1b
Date: 2013 October 14

Obsolete forms of the DO loop are hard to understand, especially
for modern programmers, and are error prone.  They are redundant
with block loops.  UK Item 10 subitem 1b, accepted at Delft,
advocates deleting these forms.

Specification:  The non block forms of the do loop are deleted.
The shared termination forms of the do loop are deleted.

Syntax: The non block forms are no longer valid syntax.
Shared termination of do loops is no longer valid syntax.

Edits:

[intro] Add new feature
        "The nonblock forms of the DO construct have been deleted."
