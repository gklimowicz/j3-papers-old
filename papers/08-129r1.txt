Subject: ACTION of preconnected INPUT_UNIT and OUTPUT_UNIT not specified
Date: 2008 February 13

1.0 Edits to be acted upon

The ACTION of the preconnected units INPUT_UNIT and OUTPUT_UNIT, nor of
the asterisk units to which they refer, is not clearly specified.

Hyperlinks enclosed in {}.

[221:14-16]---------------------------------------------------------------
  Replace 9.5.1p4:
    "In a READ statement, an <io-unit> that is an asterisk identifies an
     {external unit} that is preconnected for sequential formatted input
     (9.6.4.2).  This unit is also identified by the value of the named
     constant INPUT_UNIT of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
     (13.8.2.9).  In a WRITE statement, an <io-unit> that is an asterisk
     identifies an {external unit} that is preconnected for sequential
     formatted output (9.6.4.2).  This unit is also identified by the value
     of the named constant OUTPUT_UNIT of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic
     module (13.8.2.17)."
  NB: 13.8.2.9 is \ref{D13:INPUT_UNIT} and .17 is \ref{D13:OUTPUT_UNIT}.

[239:10]------------------------------------------------------------------
  Within the fourth line of 9.6.4.2p1 after "list" insert
    "(9.5.1) and is the same as the unit identified by the value of the
     named constant INPUT_UNIT of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
     (13.8.2.9)."

[239:12]------------------------------------------------------------------
  Within the sixth line of 9.6.4.2p1,
  after the first "statement" insert
    "(9.5.1) and is the same as the unit identified by the value of the
     named constant OUTPUT_UNIT of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
     (13.8.2.17)."

[434:14]------------------------------------------------------------------
  Within the second line of 13.8.2.9p1,
  Replace "preconnected external unit" by
    "external unit preconnected for sequential formatted input",
  and replace "(9.5)" by
    "; this unit is the one used for a READ statement that does not contain
     an input/output control list (9.6.4.2)".
  NB: Reference is \ref{D9:Identifying a unit}.

[435:19]------------------------------------------------------------------
  Within the second line of 13.8.2.17p1,
  replace "preconnected external unit" by
    "external unit preconnected for sequential formatted output",
  and replace "(9.5)" by
    "; this unit is the one used for a PRINT statement (9.6.4.2)".
  NB: Reference as above.

[576:35-38]---------------------------------------------------------------
  No changes are needed here since these items already clearly specified
  whether the units are connected for input or output.

2.0 Edits not to be acted upon

It would be nice to replace 9.5.1(4) and 9.6.4.2p1 by a single paragraph
that says the union of the things said in both paragraphs, and only says
them once.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 08-111, don't bother to say that READ is not allowed for ERROR_UNIT and
OUTPUT_UNIT, since READ is not allowed for units connected for output.
