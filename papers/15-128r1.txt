Discussion
----------

In his recent ballot (see N2045) Reinhold Bader remarked that bullet 3
of 8.2 should describe what the atomics do, beyond the already existing
ones. An edit corrects this.

Edit to N2040:
---------------

[33:19-20] Replace "atomic memory operations provide low-level
primitives ... computation;" by

"additional atomic subroutines perform integer addition, compare
and swap, and bitwise computations;"
