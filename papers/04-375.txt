    The committee discussed formation of new subgroups:  efficiency,
    portability, and ease of use were suggested topics for focus.

    All edits for possible new features will be done against the F03
    base document, as will all F03 interpretation edits.  There will
    be a new standing document that will contain all of the new feature
    edits, sorted by topic and by line number.  F03 interp edits will
    remain in the 006 until put in a Corrigendum.

    The list of papers for voting, discussion, or action later in

    Prioritizing the tasks in the 04-370 spreadsheet was discussed.
    Various weighted voting schemes were proposed.  J3 decided that,
    tomorrow, we would do a 3-way vote on each of the 128 tasks in
    04-370 that are not "No Action" using the buckets "really want",
    "maybe", and "absolutely not".

    The list of papers for voting, discussion, or action later in the

    May-2005 when a new 007 that contains all of the F03 interps plus
    all F03+ changes will become the draft Fortran 2008.
