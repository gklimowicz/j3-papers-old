Date:    August 19, 2003
To:      J3
From:    Matthijs van Waveren
Subject: Interpretation JP-24


The WG5 interpretation subgroup requests J3 to reconsider the edit given
in interpretation JP-24. This edit reads as follows:

  [127:29.5] Replace "<shared-term-do-construct>" by
   "<outer-shared-do-construct>".

We give below an example code that would be allowed by the proposed
bnf as a single construct, but should not be.

    do 10 i=1,5     ! outer
     do 20 j=1,5    ! inner
         ...
    10 continue     ! shared

The edit in Fortran 95 that would disallow above-mentioned code as a
single construct reads as follows:

  [127:29.5] Replace "<shared-term-do-construct>" by
   "<inner-shared-do-construct> and <outer-shared-do-construct>".

The corresponding edit in Fortran 2003 reads as follows:

  [168:10-11] Replace "<shared-term-do-construct>" by
   "<inner-shared-do-construct> and <outer-shared-do-construct>".

Please find below an update of the interpretation.

NUMBER: JP-24
TITLE: The bnf term shared-term-do-construct
KEYWORDS: DO, BNF
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

JP-24)
  In 8.1.4.2, second constraint below R833 states that:

  "The do-term-shared-stmt shall be identified with a label
   and all of the label-do-stmts of the shared-term-do-construct
   shall refer to the same label."

  This implies a label-do-stmts of the outer-most outer-shared-
  do-construct will permit not to refer to the same label, because
  shared-term-do-construct does not include outer-most outer-
  shared-do-construct.

  So the term "shared-term-do-construct" should be changed to
  "inner-share-do-construct and outer-shared-do-construct."

DISCUSSION:

  There is a typographical error in the question - "8.1.4.2"
  should read "8.1.4.1.2".

  The following amplification of the question was provided at the
  August 2000 WG5 meeting:

  The present BNF does not preclude the following as a single
  construct:

    do 10 i=1,5     ! outer
     do 20 j=1,5    ! outer
      do 20 k=1,5   ! outer
       do 20 l=1,5  ! inner
         ...
    20 continue     ! shared

ANSWER:

  Agreed.

EDIT:

  [127:29.5] Replace "<shared-term-do-construct>" by
   "<inner-shared-do-construct> and <outer-shared-do-construct>".

  {The intention is to alter the second line of the second constraint
   following R833.  The line numbering is awry in the F95 copy being
   used.}
