Here is a draft answer for interp. 12. I sent earlier drafts to the WG5
list for comments and would like thank those that helped me get to this
version.

NUMBER: 000012
TITLE: Evaluation of Intrinsic Procedures
KEYWORDS: Algorithm, Mathematical, Computational
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
1.  When the standard specifies an algorithm for computing a
    mathematical procedure, must a processor use the specified
    algorithm?

    Example: ANINT is defined as INT (A + 0.5).  On some processors
             ANINT (16 000 001.0) evaluates to 16 000 002.0 using
             this algorithm.

2.  May a processor return a mathematically equivalent result in the
    evaluation of a numeric intrinsic procedure?

    Example: If ANINT (16 000 001.0) can be computed as the more
             expected 16 000 001.0, may a processor do so?

ANSWER:
1.  No, a processor is not required to use the algorithm from the
    standard.

2.  Yes, a processor may return the mathematically equivalent result
    in the evaluation of any numeric intrinsic procedure.

DISCUSSION:
The use of an algorithm in the definitions for intrinsic procedures
is intended to describe the end result.  It is not intended to
require that a processor use a particular method of achieving that
result.  Thus, an algorithm specifies the mathematical results, not
the computational results, of the evaluation of intrinsic procedures.

This standard does not require a processor to use a particular
accuracy or precision.  Section 1.4, "Exclusions", states in part:

    "This standard does not specify: . . .
     (6)  The physical properties of the representation of quantities
          and the method of rounding, approximating, or computing
          numeric values on a particular processor." [1:26, 1:37-38]

The edits correct the definitions of the results for the intrinsic
functions ANINT and NINT to be expressed in mathematical terms.

EDITS:

On page 231, subclause 13.14.10, Result Value paragraph [231:16-17].
Replace by
  <Result Value.> The result is the integer nearest A, or if there are
  two integers equally near A, the result is whichever such integer has
  the greater magnitude.

On page 259, subclause 13.14.77, Result Value paragraph [259:9-10].
Replace by
  <Result Value.> The result is the integer nearest A, or if there are
  two integers equally near A, the result is whichever such integer has
  the greater magnitude.
