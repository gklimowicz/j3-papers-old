----------

Subclause 8.2 of N2040 is in a different format from the Introduction
of 15-007. Even though the base for the TS is F2008, it is more
convenient to have the text for 8.2 in the format consistent with
F2015.


Edits to N2040
--------------

[33:12] Change "After paragraph 3 of the" to "In the"

[33:14] Replace line by:
"$\bullet$ Features previously described in ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015:"

[33:15-23] Change each bullet item, as modified in edits below, into a
sentence without a bullet, and reformat the resulting sentences
together in one paragraph. And add these sentences:

"Optional STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers are added to the CRITICAL
statement.

Optional arguments are added to the intrinsic procedures
ATOMIC_DEFINE, ATOMIC_REF, IMAGE_INDEX, MOVE_ALLOC, NUM_IMAGES, and
THIS_IMAGE.

Extensions of image selector syntax permit designation of coarrays
across team boundaries and optional STAT= specifiers.

The STOPPED_IMAGES intrinsic procedure provides the indices of stopped
images."

[33:15] Change "teams" to "The teams facility uses the CHANGE TEAM
construct, TEAM_TYPE derived type, FORM TEAM and SYNC TEAM statements,
and the GET_TEAM and TEAM_ID intrinsic procedures, to"

[33:17] Change "collective subroutines perform" to "The collective
subroutines CO_BROADCAST, CO_MAX, CO_MIN, CO_REDUCE, and CO_SUM
perform".

[33:19] Change the beginning of the replacement text from 15-128r2
"additional atomic subroutines for" to "Additional atomic subroutines
ATOMIC_ADD, ATOMIC_AND, ATOMIC_CAS, ATOMIC_FETCH_ADD,
ATOMIC_FETCH_AND, ATOMIC_FETCH_OR, ATOMIC_FETCH_XOR, ATOMIC_OR, and
ATOMIC_XOR perform".

[33:21] Change "events" to "The event facility uses the EVENT POST and
EVENT WAIT statements, the EVENT_TYPE derived type, and the
EVENT_QUERY intrinsic procedure to".

[33:22] Replace the line by "The FAIL TEAM statement, the
FAILED_IMAGES and IMAGE_STATUS intrinsic procedures, and the defined
constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE provide support for continued execution
after one or more images have failed."
