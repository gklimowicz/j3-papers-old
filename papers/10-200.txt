Subject: F2008 interp re MOVE_ALLOC
Date: 2010 August 13

NUMBER: F08/xxxx
TITLE:  MOVE_ALLOC for coarrays
KEYWORDS: intrinsic, allocation
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Was it intended that MOVE_ALLOC be applicable to coarrays?

ANSWER:

No. A call for coarrays might involve the deallocation of a coarray and
therefore needs to be an image control statement for consistency with
the DEALLOCATE statement. The subroutine is classified as PURE and
C1288 says that such subprograms may not contain any image control
statements.

An edit is supplied to clarify this.

EDIT:

[372] In 13.7.118 MOVE_ALLOC (FROM, TO), paragraph 3.
    In line 1, after "It shall be allocatable." add
       "It shall not be a coarray."
    In line 2, after "It shall be allocatable." add
       "It shall not be a coarray."
