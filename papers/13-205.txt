We have agreed to end support for Part 2 at about the same time
that f1x is to be published.  Therefore, the disposition
of VS could appropriately be incorporated into f1x.

I'm not advocating any particular subset from VS to be in f1x,
only that we should include the disposition in f1x.  Let's
decide what we mean to do, and do it.
