After serious discussion the /data subgroup recommends that the following
items from those identified in WG5/N1238 as Category-2 items be
included into Fortran 2000:

    1(a) Single inheritance as described in paper X3J3/97-131.
     (b) Allow programmers the ability to call one of a group of
	 procedures based upon the run-time type of a single object.

    2    Allow programmers the ability to define their own constructors
	 and destructors.
