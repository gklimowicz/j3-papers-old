Subject: Vector subscripts, ASYNCHRONOUS and VOLATILE

1. The Problem
--------------

12.5.2.4p18 puts a requirement on vector subscripts:

        If the actual argument is an array section having a vector
        subscript, the dummy argument is not definable and shall not
        have the ASYNCHRONOUS, INTENT (OUT), INTENT (INOUT), or VOLATILE
        attributes.

6.5.3.3.2p2 puts on a similar but not identical requirement:

        An array section with a vector subscript shall not be
        o  argument associated with a dummy argument that is defined or
           redefined,....

The requirement in 12.5.2.4p18 does not address unspecified intent.  The
requirement in 6.5.3.3.2p2 does not address ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE.

This diffusion of incompleteness is confusing.  The requirements ought
to be complete in one place.

2. Edits w.r.t. 12-007
----------------------

[295:3-4] Delete 12.5.2.4p18.

[124:5] Replace the second list item in 6.5.3.3.2p2:

  "o   argument associated with a dummy argument that is defined,
       redefined, becomes undefined, or has the ASYNCHRONOUS, INTENT
       (OUT), INTENT (INOUT), or VOLATILE attribute,"
