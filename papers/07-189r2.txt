[119:9] ------------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Insert "data" before "pointer".]

[120:24] -----------------------------------------------------------------
[Duplicates [19:22]. Editor: Delete the paragraph.

[124:7] ------------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Replace "that" by "its".]

[125:0+] -----------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Continuation of Table 6.1 needs a heading.]

[126:4-7] ----------------------------------------------------------------
[The many-one array section restriction is needlessly complicated by
singling out only the two possible cases of its appearance in a variable
definition context. It would be simpler to say "variable definition
context." The subclause would be clearer if this material were after
material on the more general case. Editor: Move "A many-one . . .
statement" to be a new paragraph at [126:10+]. Then replace "appear . . .
statement" by "not appear in a variable-definition context (16.6.7)".]

[128:1,5] ----------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Replace "a <type-spec>" by "<type-spec>" twice.]

[130:35-36] --------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Delete "An unsaved . . . unallocated." since that's covered by
[130:30].]

[133:18] -----------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Insert "The" before "<stat-variable>".]

[134:4] ------------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Insert "The" before "<errmsg-variable>".]
