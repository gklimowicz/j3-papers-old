TITLE: Pointer association and extended type arrays
KEYWORDS: pointer association, extended type
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Should a pointer that is pointer associated with a dummy array or an
element or section of a dummy array remain associated after return
from the procedure that contains the dummy array if the dummy array
is not polymorphic and the dynamic type of the effective argument of
the dummy array is not the same as the type of the dummy array?

The restrictions on pointer association listed in paragraph 9 of
Clause 12.5.2.4 [294:6-13] appear to miss a case.  Consider the
program

      MODULE TYPES
        TYPE T1
          INTEGER I
        END TYPE
        TYPE, EXTENDS(T1) :: T2
          INTEGER J
        END TYPE
      END

      MODULE GLOBALS
        USE TYPES
        TYPE(T1), POINTER :: P
      END

      SUBROUTINE SUB1(A, N)
        USE TYPES
        CLASS(T1), TARGET, INTENT(IN) :: A(N)
        INTERFACE SUB2
          SUBROUTINE SUB2(A, N)
            USE GLOBALS
            TYPE(T1), TARGET, INTENT(IN) :: A(N)
          END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE
        CALL SUB2(A, N)
      END

      SUBROUTINE SUB2(A, N)
        USE GLOBALS
        TYPE(T1), TARGET, INTENT(IN) :: A(N)
        P => A(2)
      END

      PROGRAM MAIN
        USE GLOBALS
        TYPE(T2), TARGET :: A(5)
        INTERFACE
          SUBROUTINE SUB1(A, N)
            USE TYPES
            CLASS(T1), TARGET, INTENT(IN) :: A(N)
          END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE
        A = (/( T2(I, I + 1), I = 1, 10, 2 )/)
        CALL SUB1(A, 5)
        P = T1(11)
        PRINT *, A
      END

The effective argument of the dummy argument A in the call of SUB2
satisfies the requirements for being simply contiguous given in
paragraph 2 of Clause 6.5.4 [125:2-14].  Therefore, according to
the second bullet item in paragraph 9 of Clause 12.5.2.4, the
pointer P be associated with the parent component of the second
element of the array A when the second assignment statement in the
main program is executed.  Therefore, the output of the program
should be

 1 2 11 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

None of the implementations tested produced that result.
