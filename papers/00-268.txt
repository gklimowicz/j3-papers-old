 Subject:  Results of ballots on interpretations

 Here is a copy of N1403, which details WG5's decisions on all
 the interpretations that had reached the stage of 'passed by
 J3 letter ballot'.

                  Results of ballots on interpretations

                              Niki Reid

                             WG5 BALLOT

 067: Writing zeros
 068: Asterisks as I/O units
 071: Character Array Constructors

 Failed: the WG5 ballot prior to Oulu meeting raised serious objections
 to these three interpretations which the working group feel need to be
 dealt with by J3 (see N1395 and N1399).

 069: What is a numeric character?

 Passed without changes

 070: Asymmetry between constant specification and initialization
 expression.

 Edits in N1393 (006r1), with the following modifications:

 [39:15-16] Change "a constant specification expression (7.1.6.2)"
            to "an initialization expression (7.1.6.1)".

 [39:23-24] Change "a constant specification expression (7.1.6.2)"
            to "an initialization expression (7.1.6.1)".

 [54:36-37] Replace sentence with "The bounds of such an array are
            unaffected by the redefinition or undefinition of any variable

            during execution of the procedure.".

 [56:33-34] Replace sentence with "The bounds of such an array are
            unaffected by the redefinition or undefinition of any variable

            during execution of the procedure.".

 Additional edit:

 [54:29-30] Change "nonconstant expressions" to "expressions that are
            not initialization expressions".

 072: Resolving generic procedure references

 Passed without modifications

 076: INTENT(IN) Dummy arguments and implied DO loops

 Passed without modifications

 077: INTENT(IN) Dummy arguments and  NULLIFY

 Mofified edit:

 Replace constraint (2) [53:16] with "A <pointer-object> in a
           <pointer-assignment-stmt> or <nullify-stmt>, "

 The following edits were accepted without modification:

 079:  Pointer assignment and allocatable arrays

 080: Host association and the EXTERNAL attribute

 082: Usage of BOZ literal constants

 083: Scope of array-constructor implied-DO variable

 084: Events that cause variables to be defined

 F90/100: ASSOCIATED intrinsic and zero-sized objects

 F90/179: DO variable with POINTER attribute

 F90/185: What is the allocation status of an array after an allocation
 failure?

 F90/194: Statements between SELECT CASE and CASE

 ................................................................

                             J3 BALLOT (N1399)

 001: Visibility of a data object with statement scope

 Accept without modifications

 N1385: France's (AFNOR) contribution to SC22/WG5 2000 Summer Meeting.
 This document requests that the type parameter of an integer used in an
 implied-do be taken from the highest range of the the implied-do.  This
 change also requested for implied-do loops in the FORALL statement.
 WG5 does not accept these requests.

 003: Ability to overload the character operator.

 Accept without modifications

 005: Value returned by SELECTED_REAL_KIND

 Accept without modifications

 012: Evaluation of Intrinsic Procedures

 Return to J3 for function definition to be rephrased to being
 mathematics rather than Fortran dependent.

 Suggested edit:

 "The result is the integer nearest A, or if there are two such integers
 equally near A, then the result is the greater in magnitude."

 It is also recommended that the definition of the intrinsic function
 NINT be rephrased in a similar style.
