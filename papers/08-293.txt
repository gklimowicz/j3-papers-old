Discussion:

The new COMPLEX intrinsic function proposed in 08-266r1 is of the form

   COMPLEX (RE, IM)

where RE and IM are type real and have the same kind.

Based on feedback from compiler writers and users, it would be better
to relax the restrictions on the arguments so that they matched the
requirements for the real and imaginary parts of a complex literal
constant [54:4.4.4 Complex type, p4-p5].  RE and IM could be real or
integer, and have different kind values.  This provides better
consistency in the standard, makes COMPLEX seem more like a type value
constructor which is easy for the user to understand, and avoids
problems that arise when one of the arguments is a literal constant
and the code is compiled with an "-r8" option.
