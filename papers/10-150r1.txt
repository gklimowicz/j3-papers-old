Discussion
----------

13.7.1p2 says that the descriptions of arguments of intrinsic procedures
describe the actual arguments.  In some cases there are specifications
that are surely intended to apply to those arguments when viewed as dummy
arguments of the procedures, such as the SIZE argument of RANDOM_SEED
being an INTENT(OUT) argument.  Given the specification in 13.7.1p2, this
could be construed to be a severely-restrictive requirement on the actual
argument.
