1. Introduction

This paper responds to 07-195.

2. Discussion

Using fixed-form insignificant blanks in MACRO definitions is clearly
nauseating and inappropriate.  Tokenisation of a macro body construct
should proceed according to the rules for free form.

However, all other rules of fixed form w.r.t. line length, commentary
and continuation should apply.

3. Edits to 07-007r1

[31:24+] Insert heading "3.3.1.1 Free form line length".
[31:28+] Insert heading "3.3.1.2 Blank characters in free form"
{Insert ISO-required headings, and we will refer to the second one.}

[31:29] Change "Blank" to
  "In free source form, and in <macro-body-construct>s in fixed source
   form, blank"
{Make this a true statement.}

[33:20] After "Except in" insert "a <macro-body-construct> or".
{Remove "blanks are insignificant" condition on macro body constructs.}

[33:20] Append new sentence to paragraph
  "The rules in \ref{D3:Blank characters in free form} apply also to
   the appearance of blanks within and between tokens in
   <macro-body-construct>s in fixed form."
{Refer to the rules.  Not strictly necessarily but much clearer.}
