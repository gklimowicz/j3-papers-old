At [365:4] the result type of maskr is described as Bits.
It should likely be as maskl, as have a result type
of integer.  This appears to be another escapee from the bits farm.

I suspect this is for 008, unless this is deemed fussworthy.

Edits:

{Editor, remove zombie type from result clause}

[365:4]  Change "Bits." to "Integer."
