TITLE: First character of namelist output records
KEYWORDS: namelist, output, UDDTIO
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The last sentence of 10.10.2.2 of Fortran 2003 states:
    Except for continuation of delimited character sequences, each
    output record begins with a blank character.

If a namelist output statement causes a user-defined derived-type
output procedure to be called, was it intended to be standard-
conforming for that procedure to create a new record (perhaps by using
the slash edit descriptor) that does not begin with a blank character?


ANSWER:

Yes, this situation was intended to be standard-conforming.  Explicit formatting
in user-defined derived-type output is not required to output a leading blank
in this case.  An edit is provided to correct this oversight.


EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[247:33] Before "continuation", insert "new records created by
         explicit formatting within a user-defined derived-type
         output procedure or by".
