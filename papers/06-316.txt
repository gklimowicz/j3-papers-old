Discussion of issues 20 and 23 (pages 117 and 157)

Issues 20 and 23 were discussed in 06-241. There was disgreement over 
the rules for 
     Z[P] = Z
when Z is of a derived type with an allocatable component. 

Remote allocation has never been part of CAF and there is agreement
about keeping this prohibition. The disgreement was over whether to
allow such an assignment when the shapes of the corresponding
allocatable components conform. A straw vote at meeting 177 was 2 in
favor, 8 against, and 2 undecided. Accepting this decision, the text
at [157:9-10] is retained and no edits are needed to resolve issues 20
and 23.
