Hi, Jim,

This is to formally tell you that IBM has missed 2 of the last 3 J3
meetings {m185 in Aug-2008 and m187 in Feb-2009}.  If IBM is not
represented at the next J3 meeting {m188 in May-2009 in Las Vegas},
IBM will lose membership on J3 {ie, PL22.3}.

I hope we’ll see you in May.

Thank you                                 /Stan
