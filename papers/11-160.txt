Subject:   A.1.3 Example code
Date: 2011 June 07
Reference: WG5/N1854, WG5/N1848

Discussion:
-----------

In the Annex, the text for A.1.3 was removed when a rule change made
the code no longer valid. A placeholder comment was inserted in its
place. There are three options for repairing the draft:

Option 1: Instead use the example code in the final edit of paper
N1848.

Option 2: Do not replace the example.

Option 3: Write a new example, perhaps that used more of the CFI_*
functions. The current examples only use CFI_establish.


Edits to N1854:
--------------

Option 1:

[33:33] Replace line with the final edit in N1848, beginning

"Assuming that a Fortran object declared

CLASS(*), ALLOCATABLE, TARGET :: one_d_field(:)

...


Option 2:

[28:40] Replace "A.1.6" with "A.1.5" and replace "C.11.11" with
"C.11.10".

[31:21] Replace "- A.1.4" with "and A.1.3"

        {Subclauses following A.1.2 will be automatically numbered be
        the next edit.}

[33:32-33] Delete two lines.


Option 3:
