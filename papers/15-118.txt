NUMBER: F08/            ! /interp assigns number after submission
TITLE: contiguity of an explicit-shape or assumed-size array dummy
       argument with assumed character length of a bind(c) procedure
KEYWORDS: CONTIGUITY, BIND(C)
DEFECT TYPE:            ! /interp assigns
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Should the Fortran processor handle the contiguity of an
explicit-shape or assumed-size array dummy argument with assumed
character length of a bind(c) procedure?

Consider the following code fragment:

  subroutine sub(arg1, arg2) bind(c)
    character(*) :: arg1(*)
    character(*) :: arg2(2,3)
    .....
    .....
  end subroutine

Both arg1 and arg2 are contiguous according to 5.3.7p2 [97:21].

TS29113 specifies that arg1 and arg2 correspond to a CFI descriptor
as they have assumed character length. However, it does not
explicitly specify if the Fortran processor needs to handle the
contiguity for arg1 and arg2 in the case that the caller is a C
function that passes non-contiguous CFI descriptor actual arguments.

I found the following at 15.3.7p5 [453:11-16] as:

"In an invocation of an interoperable procedure whose Fortran
interface has an assumed-shape or assumed-rank dummy argument with
the CONTIGUOUS attribute, the associated effective argument may be
an array that is not contiguous or the address of a C descriptor for
such an array. If the procedure is invoked from Fortran or the
procedure is a Fortran procedure, the Fortran processor will
handle the difference in contiguity. If the procedure is invoked from
C and the procedure is a C procedure, the C code within the procedure
shall be prepared to handle the situation of receiving a
discontiguous argument."

ANSWER:

Yes. The Fortran processor needs to handle the difference in
contiguity.

EDITS to 14-007r2:

[453:12 15.3.7p5] After "CONTIGUOUS attribute," add the following:
"or an explicit-shape or assumed-size array dummy argument with
assumed character length,"
