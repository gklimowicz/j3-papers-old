This is a whack at interp F03/0087.  The outcome proposed here is the
same as in the original submission.   Bill Long pointed out that the
repair was incomplete.

========================================================================

NUMBER: F03/0087
TITLE: Entry names as dummy procedure arguments
KEYWORDS: Entry names, dummy procedure arguments
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Does the following subprogram fragment conflict with the 2003 Fortran
standard?  If so, was the conflict intended?

  entry A ( X )
    interface
      subroutine X ( A )
        abstract interface
          subroutine I ( ... )
          ...
          end subroutine I
        end interface
        procedure (I) A
      end subroutine X
    end interface
  ...

It seems that constraint C1255 in subclause 12.5.2.4 [283:10-12] prohibits
the entry name A to appear in the PROCEDURE statement in the interface
body.  There shouldn't be a problem, however, since the PROCEDURE
statement is in a different scoping unit.

ANSWER:

No, this program fragment conforms to the 2003 Fortran standard.

EDITS:

None

NOTE:

C1255 is pointless because Clause 16 applies.  It could
fruitfully be removed from a future revision of the Fortran standard.
