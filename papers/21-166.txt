Subject: Edits for procedure pointers
References: 21-007r1
Date: 2021-June-29

The definition of the term procedure pointer has been
emended in Fortran 202x.  The emendation missed one of
the most important cases, namely, the definition of the
term procedure pointer in Subclause 15.2.2.4
"Procedure pointers", [304:2].  An edit is provided.

The text of Subclause 15.2.2.4 asserts that a procedure
pointer may be pointer associated with "a dummy
procedure that is not a procedure pointer".  A
procedure pointer cannot be pointer associated with a
dummy procedure.  Subclause 10.2.2.4 "Procedure pointer
assignment" p1, [176:32-33] states that when the pointer
target is a dummy procedure that is not a procedure
pointer, the pointer object becomes pointer associated
with the ultimate argument of the dummy procedure.  The
ultimate argument of a dummy procedure cannot be a dummy
procedure.  An edit is provided.

Subclause 15.2.2.4, [304:2] uses the word "may".  The
word "can" would be better in this case.  An edit is
provided.

The two parts of the sentence in Subclause 15.2.2.4
would be better split into two sentences.  An edit is
provided.

The intrinsic function ASSOCIATED does not handle the
case where the TARGET argument is a dummy procedure.
If the dummy procedure is a procedure pointer other
than a dummy procedure pointer, ASSOCIATED should use
the ultimate argument of TARGET, not TARGET itself.
A strict reading of the current text is that the result
of invoking ASSOCIATED with a TARGET that is a dummy
procedure other than a dummy procedure pointer must
return false, which is obviously not intended.  Edits
are supplied.


EDITS to 21-007r1

[304:2] 15.2.2.4 Procedure pointers
Replace "the EXTERNAL and POINTER attributes" with
"the POINTER attribute".

[304:2] 15.2.2.4 Procedure pointers
Replace "; it" with ". A procedure pointer".

[304:2] 15.2.2.4 Procedure pointers"
Replace "may with "can".

[304:3-4] 15.2.2.4 Procedure pointers
Replace
"an external procedure, an internal procedure, an
 intrinsic procedure, a module procedure, or a
 dummy procedure that is not a procedure pointer."
with
"an external, internal, intrinsic, or module
 procedure"

{The resulting Subclause is
  15.2.2.4 Procedure pointers
  A procedure pointer is a procedure that has the
  POINTER attribute.  A procedure pointer can be
  pointer associated with an external, internal,
  intrinsic, or module procedure.}

[361:13] 16.9.20 ASSOCIATED
After "a procedure" insert "other than a dummy
procedure or a procedure pointer".

[361:14+] 16.9.20 ASSOCIATED
After Case (ii) insert
"Case (iia): If TARGET is present and is a dummy
             procedure that is not a procedure pointer,
             the result is true if and only if POINTER
             is associated with the procedure that is
             the ultimate argument of TARGET and, if
             the procedure is an internal procedure,
             they have the same host instance."
