The term 'global namespace' corresponds to C++ and not C.  Even worse, C
uses the term 'namespace' with a very different meaning!  Fortran should
not go there.

Also, reserving names for future use is a good idea, though WG5 cannot
constrain WG14.  The following proposes a fairly hard line - less harsh
restrictions are possible, but I doubt that this will inconvenience
anyone sane.

Yes, I know that the specification is revolting, but there are C-ish
reasons for it!


Edits to 10-165r2:

[9:16-17] The paragraph "No names other than those specified ...."
should be replace by a new paragraph and a NOTE:

"A C source file that includes the header ISO_Fortran_binding.h shall
not use any names starting CFI_ that are not defined in the header.  All
names defined in the header begin with CFI_ or an underscore character,
or are defined by a standard C header that it includes."
