Introduction

At meeting 218, paper 19-160 was passed supporting specifications
of the Part 2 procedures in the main standard.  The edits in this paper
propose to add a new 16.10.3 following the 16.10.2 subclause describing
the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.



Syntax

The results of straw votes taken at 218 regarding the names of the module
and its contained procedures are assumed; these may be changed
by new straw votes.  However, this paper does not propose
new straw votes.  The reasons given for these decisions are
existing usage, and clarity of the part 2 names.

This paper attempts to craft edits.

16.10.3 The ISO_FORTRAN_STRINGS intrinsic module

16.10.3.1 General
The intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_STRINGS provides public entities
for character manipulation.

The processor shall provide the named procedures described in 16.10.3.
In the detailed descriptions below, procedure names are generic
and not specific.  They may have character arguments
of any character kind supported by the processor.

16.10.3.2 EXTRACT ( STRING [, START, FINISH] )

<<Description.>> Extracts a specified substring from a string.

<<Class.>> Elemental function.

<<Arguments.>>
STRING            shall be of type CHARACTER.
START (optional)  shall be of type INTEGER.
FINISH (optional) shall be of type INTEGER.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Of type CHARACTER.

<<Result Value.>> The result value is a copy of the characters
of the argument STRING between positions START and FINISH, inclusive.
If START is absent or less than one, the value one is used for START.
If FINISH is absent or greater than LEN(STRING), the value LEN(STRING)
is used for FINISH. If FINISH is less than START,
the result is a zero-length string.



16.10.3.3 INSERT (STRING, START, SUBSTRING)

<<Description.>> Inserts a substring into a string
                 at a specified position.

<<Class.>> Elemental function.

<<Arguments.>>
STRING    shall be type CHARACTER.
START     shall be type INTEGER.
SUBSTRING shall be type CHARACTER.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Type CHARACTER.

<<Result Value.>> The result value is a copy of the characters
of the argument STRING with the characters of SUBSTRING inserted
into the copy of STRING before the character at the character position
START. If START is greater than LEN(STRING), the value LEN(STRING)+1 is
used for START and SUBSTRING is appended to the copy of STRING.
If START is less than one, the value one is used for START
and SUBSTRING is inserted before the first character
of the copy of STRING.



16.10.3.4 REMOVE (STRING [, START, FINISH])

<<Description.>> Removes a specified SUBSTRING from a STRING.

<<Class.>> Elemental function.

<<Arguments.>>
STRING            shall be of type CHARACTER
START (optional)  shall be of type INTEGER.
FINISH (optional) shall be of type INTEGER.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Of type CHARACTER.

<<Result Value.>> The result value is a copy of the characters
of STRING with the characters between positions START and FINISH,
inclusive, removed. If START is absent or less than one,
the value one is used for START. If FINISH is absent or greater than
LEN(STRING), the value LEN(STRING) is used for FINISH.
If FINISH is less than START, the characters of STRING are
delivered unchanged as the result.



16.10.3.5 REPLACE (STRING, START, SUBSTRING) or
REPLACE (STRING, START, FINISH, SUBSTRING) or
REPLACE (STRING, TARGET, SUBSTRING [,EVERY, BACK])

<<Description.>> Replaces a subset of the characters in a string
by a given substring. The subset may be specified either by position
or by content.

<<Class.>> Elemental function.

<<Arguments.>>
STRING        shall be of type CHARACTER.
START         shall be of type INTEGER.
FINISH        shall be of type INTEGER.
SUBSTRING     shall be of type CHARACTER.
TARGET        shall be of type CHARACTER. It shall not be of zero length.
EVERY (optional) shall be of type LOGICAL.
BACK (optional) shall be of type LOGICAL.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Of type CHARACTER.

<<Result Value.>> The result value is a copy of the characters
in STRING modified as per one of the cases below.

Case(i): For a reference of the form
    REPLACE(STRING, START, SUBSTRING)
the characters of the argument SUBSTRING are inserted into the copy
of STRING beginning with the character at the character position START.
The characters in positions from START
to MIN(STRING+LEN(SUBSTRING)-1,LEN(STRING)) are deleted. If START is
greater than LEN(STRING), the value LEN(STRING)+1 is used for START and
SUBSTRING is appended to the copy of STRING. If START is less than one,
the value one is used for START.

Case(ii): For a reference of the form
    REPLACE(STRING, START, FINISH, SUBSTRING)
the characters in the copy of STRING between positions START and FINISH,
including those at START and FINISH, are deleted and replaced
by the characters of SUBSTRING. If start is less than one, the value one
is used for START. If FINISH is greater than LEN(STRING), the value
LEN(STRING) is used for FINISH. If FINISH is less than START,
the characters of SUBSTRING are inserted before the character at START
and no characters are deleted.

Case(iii): For a reference of the form
    REPLACE(STRING, TARGET, SUBSTRING, EVERY, BACK)
the copy of STRING is searched for occurrences of TARGET. The search
is done in the backward direction if the argument BACK is present
with the value true, and in the forward direction otherwise. If TARGET
is found, it is replaced by SUBSTRING. If EVERY is present
with the value true, the search and replace is continued
from the character following TARGET in the search direction specified
until all occurrences of TARGET in the copy STRING are replaced;
otherwise only the first occurrence of TARGET is replaced.



16.10.3.6 SPLIT (STRING, WORD, SET [, SEPARATOR, BACK])

<<Description.>> Splits a string into two substrings with the substrings
separated by the occurrence of a character
from a specified separator set.

<<Class.>> Elemental subroutine.

<<Arguments.>>
STRING   shall be of type CHARACTER. It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.
WORD     shall be of type CHARACTER. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.
SET      shall be of type CHARACTER. It is an INTENT(IN) argument.
SEPARATOR (optional) shall be of type CHARACTER.
         It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.
BACK (optional) shall be of type LOGICAL.
         It is an INTENT(IN) argument.

<<Action.>> The effect of the procedure is to divide STRING
at the first occurrence of a character that is in SET. The STRING is
searched in the forward direction unless BACK is present with the value
true, in which case the search is in the backward direction.
The characters passed over in the search are returned
in the argument WORD and the remainder of STRING, not including
the SEPARATOR character, is returned in the argument STRING. If
the argument SEPARATOR is present, the actual character found which
separates WORD from the remainder of STRING is returned
in SEPARATOR. If no character from SET is found or SET is of zero length,
the whole STRING is returned in WORD, STRING is returned as zero length,
and SEPARATOR (if present) is returned as zero length. The effect
of the procedure is such that, on return, either WORD//SEPARATOR//STRING
is the same as the initial STRING for a forward search,
or STRING//SEPARATOR//WORD is the same as the initial STRING
for a backward search.
