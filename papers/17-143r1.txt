Subject: Problem with ASYNCHRONOUS and VOLATILE in BLOCK constructs
Date: 2017 April 28

1. Discussion
=============

Something in 19.4p1 that might or might not have any consequence.

The penultimate sentence says "An entity that is explicitly declared in
the specification part of a BLOCK construct, other than only in
ASYNCHRONOUS and VOLATILE statements, is a construct entity."

I think "and" should be "or" else in

  integer I
  block
    asynchronous I
  end block

"I" is a construct entity because it doesn't appear in a VOLATILE
statement, but it shouldn't be a construct entity.  Also, in

  implicit integer ( X )
  block
    asynchronous X
  end block

"X" isn't a construct entity, but ought to be.

  real :: Y
  block
    import, only :: Y
    asynchronous Y
  end block

"Y" is a construct entity but ought not to be.

2. Edits
========

[516:12-13 19.4p1 penultimate sentence] Replace "other than only in
ASYNCHRONOUS and VOLATILE" with "other than a variable accessed by host
association and declared only in ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE" making the
entire sentence read

"An entity that is explicitly declared in the specification part of a
BLOCK construct, other than a variable accessed by host association and
declared only in ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE statements, is a construct
entity."

3. Question
===========

Does this need a sentence in the intro?
