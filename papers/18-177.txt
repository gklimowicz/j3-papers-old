Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, the GB comment
049 reads:

Clarification. Subclause 5.3.4 requires that an image index be not
greater than the number of images in a team.

with the suggested edit:

After "on any image" add ", provided the number of images is at least
213"

Discussion
----------

Agreed. The current Example for IMAGE_INDEX is only conditionally
accurate.


Edit to N2146
-------------

[390:IMAGE_INDEXp6] in 16.9.97 IMAGE_INDEX..., at the end of paragraph
6 (Examples.):

After "(on any image)" add ", provided the number of images is at
least 213".
