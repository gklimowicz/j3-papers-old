QUESTION:

JP-5)

  4.5 Construction of array values,

  "The ac-do-variable of an ac-implied-do that is in another
   ac-implied-do shall not appear as the ac-do-variable of the
   containing ac-implied-do."

  This sentence should be a Constraint.

ANSWER:

No. The requirement should be made a constraint in the next
standard. It should remain a simple requirement in Fortran 95
to avoid invalidating existing implementations.

EDIT: None
