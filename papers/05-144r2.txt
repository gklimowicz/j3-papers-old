The hate-love vote for this one was 0-3-10-0.

Number:
Title: Rank > 7
Submitted By: J3
Status: For Consideration

Basic Functionality:

Relax the restriction on the maximum rank of an array.

Rationale:

The limit of seven dimensions was set when Fortran was first
published in 1957 and has never been changed. Requests for
increasing this limit have been made by international bodies for
years. See the previous WG5 repository N1189, Numbers 24 (from
the Russian Fortran Working Group) and Number 24a (from X3J3,
JOR 95-004r1, item 067).

Estimated Impact: (Listed as 4 on the JKR scale) 

The standard would require changes in at least four places. This
will not impact any existing code. Any other impact should be
apparent only when arrays of rank greater than seven are declared
and referenced.

Detailed Specification: Increase the maximum permitted rank for
arrays.

Changes would be needed to the following places in F2003:
[18:5] An array may have up to seven dimensions ...
[78:4] C541 (R510) The maximum rank is seven.
(repeated in Annex D, page 517)
[108:6+] Table 6.1
[353:19] The rank of SOURCE shall be less than 7.

History: Aug 95, J3 Meeting 134: Change max 255 to > 7
         approved by US TAG for F2000 as medium priority
