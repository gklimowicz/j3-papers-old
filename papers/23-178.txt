Subject: F202Y Make the D format edit descriptor obsolescent
Date: 2023-June-12

Reference: 23-154

The D format edit descriptor is redundant, requires special-case
treatment in the standard, and has not been extended to add
options such as exponent width or engineering notation as has the
E edit descriptor. It should be declared obsolescent so as to
discourage its use in programs.

This proposal would not affect the use of the D exponent letter
in real constants in formatted, list-directed or namelist input,
nor would it affect the use of the D exponent letter in a real
literal oconstant.
