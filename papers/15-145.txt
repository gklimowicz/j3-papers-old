Subject: JOR's response to issues in the Editor's report 15-104
Date: 2015 February 24
Ref: 14-007r3, 15-007

The only paper called out in 15-104 that had actions for /JOR is
14-247r3:

[64:26 4.5.2.2p2] ACTION: Further wordsmithing required.

  Please make the following changes in 15-007:

  [64:29] 4.5.2.2p1 insert after the first sentence:

    "An <access-spec> on the <derived-type-stmt> specifies the
     accessibility of the type name."

    so the 1st paragraph reads:

      The accessibility of a type name is determined as specified in
      5.5.2. An <access-spec> on the <derived-type-stmt> specifies the
      accessibility of the type name. The accessibility of a type name
      does not affect, and is not affected by, the accessibility of its
      components and type-bound procedures.

  [65:1] 4.5.2.2p2 replace "If" with "When" so the paragraph reads:

    If a type definition is private, then the type name, and thus the
    structure constructor (4.5.10) for the type, are accessible only
    within the module containing the definition, and within its
    descendants.

[387:8+] ACTION: Looking at this, the standard is crying out for
                 "unordered segments" to be indexed.  Someone should
                 do that sometime.

  Please add "unordered segments" to the index with these references:

    190:25
    190:28-29
    Note 8.30
    Note 8.31
    321:14-15
    329:4
    329:7
    387:6
    496:35
    497:13

[496:37+] EXTRA EDIT: say something about "getenv" in the pd list.

  Please add a bullet item:

    "The interpretation of case in the NAME= argument in
     GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE;"
