Subject: Interpretation request on host association


NUMBER:
TITLE:  Host association and the EXTERNAL attribute
KEYWORDS: Host association, EXTERNAL
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS:
QUESTION:

Use of a (non-intrinsic) name as a procedure in a procedure reference
implicitly confers the EXTERNAL attribute on the name.  Does this happen
when the name is host-associated?

For example, interp 143 established that

  MODULE m
    REAL x
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE s
      PRINT *,x(1)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END

was invalid - 11.3.2 now says that a "procedure with implicit interface and
public accessibility shall explicitly be given the EXTERNAL attribute in the
scoping unit of the module".

However, this text says nothing about private entities, so considering:

  MODULE m2
    REAL,PRIVATE :: x
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE s
      PRINT *,x(1)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END

This example does not violate 11.3.2 because X is PRIVATE.
Is this example conforming?

Further, considering:

  PROGRAM m3
    REAL x
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE s
      PRINT *,x(1)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END

This example is not of a module and so 11.3.2 does not apply.
Is this example conforming?

ANSWER:

No, use of a host-associated name never confers attributes on the host
entity.
Examples M2 and M3 are therefore invalid.
Edits are supplied.

{Alternative answer 1:
 Yes, use of a host-associated name confers attributes on the host entity
 except when the host entity is a PUBLIC entity of a module.  No edits.}

{Alternative answer 2:
 Yes, use of a host-associated name always confers attributes on the host
 entity.  All 3 examples are therefore valid.  Edits are supplied to make
 example 1 valid.}

COMMENT to J3: Observed behaviour of existing implementations includes:
 (1) all examples accepted
 (2) M1 rejected, M2 and M3 accepted
 (3) M1 and M2 rejected, M3 accepted
 (4) all examples rejected.
[All 4 forms of behaviour are conforming if the examples are not
conforming...]

EDIT:

[188:28] Delete "and public accessibility".

[188:31] Delete "with public accessibility".

[283:16+] Add new paragraph
"A procedure with an implicit interface that is accessed via host
association
 shall be referenced as a procedure in the host scoping unit or be used as a
 procedure in that scoping unit.  An intrinsic procedure that is accessed
via
 host association shall explicitly be given the INTRINSIC attribute in the
 host scoping unit or be used as an intrinsic procedure in that scoping
unit."

{Alternative answer 2: ... edits required...}
