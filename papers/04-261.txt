Title: CRAY pointers and malloc

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: 

Basic Functionality: Please add the CRAY pointers and malloc. Also allow CRAY
pointers in derived types.


Rationale: It will support existing body of software that uses the CRAY
pointers extension. It will allow the user to intercept 
and manage memory allocations via malloc easily if desired.
Cray pointers in derived types are needed to allow structures
compatible with C.

Estimated Impact: Most compilers support CRAY pointers anyway, but it is unclear
if they may be in derived types.
