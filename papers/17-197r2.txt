Discussion:
-----------

The syntax rule for <stat-variable> is R929 at [140:25] in 9.7.1.1
Form of the ALLOCATE statement. It is a <scalar-int-variable>.  There
is no restriction on the minimum range, unlike what we require for
most of the STAT arguments to intrinsic procedures. Realistically,
sets of Fortran error codes have more than 127 distinct values, so
specifying a 8-bit integer will very likely be inadequate and not
portable.  Text should be added recommending that programs should
provide an integer variable with a decimal exponent range of at
least 4.

Noting that <stat-variable> is used in additional contexts
(DEALLOCATE, SYNC TEAM and other image control statements), it would
be better to have this recommendation in a central location
referenced from the other usages. Note that making this a constraint
rather than a recommendation would be an incompatible change with
earlier standards.

Edits to WG5/N2137:
------------------

[146:24+, 9.7.4 STAT= specifier]

Move R929 <stat-variable> from 9.7.1 (ALLOCATE statement) to the
beginning of 9.7.4, making sure that references to
succeeding rules in the rest of 9.7.1 are updated. After this BNF
rule, insert a new 9.7.4 paragraph 1:

"A <stat-variable> should have a decimal exponent range of at least
four; otherwise the processor-dependent error code might not be
representable in the variable."

[146:25] In the new p2, replace "This subclause applies" with
"The rest of this subclause applies"
