Subject:   A.1.3 Example code
Date: 2011 June 29
Reference: WG5/N1854, WG5/N1848

Discussion:
-----------

In the Annex, the text for A.1.3 was removed when a rule change made
the code no longer valid. A placeholder comment was inserted in its
place. This should now be removed.


Edits to N1854:
--------------

[28:40] Replace "A.1.6" with "A.1.5" and replace "C.11.11" with
"C.11.10".
