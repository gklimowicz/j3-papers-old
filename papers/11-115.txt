DISCUSSION

Unresolved Technical Issue TR5 of N1838 asks for Constraint C516 to
be removed.

EDIT to N1838:

2.3 Assumed-rank objects
[4:13+] At the end of the section, add

"Constraint C516 in ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 says 'The ALLOCATABLE, POINTER,
or OPTIONAL attribute shall not be specified for a dummy argument
of a procedure that has a proc-language-binding-spec.' This is
deleted since it is no longer applicable."
