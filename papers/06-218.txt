Subject: C8 - UTI 25 : CONCURRENT iteration
Date:    28-jul-2006

---------------------

Uresolved Technical Issue 25 (page 188) suggests that the definition
of the term "iteration" probably breaks its use elsewhere in the
standard.

Reply: Apart from several uses of the term "iteration count", which is
defined separately at [187:10], the word "iteration" is used for
things other than DO CONCURRENT at two places: [185:5] and [185:8]
(based on scanning the text version of 04-007).  The uses on page 185
do not seem to require a definition, so not making the use on 188 a
definition seems OK.  There is no entry in Annex A for iteration
anyway.
