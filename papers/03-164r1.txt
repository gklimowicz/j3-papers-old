1. Introduction

The definition of "TKR incompatible" is incorrect.  This term should really be
called "distinguishable" - it really means that two dummy arguments are fully
distinguishable for the purposes of generic resolution.  The current definition
has forgotten that a subroutine, having no type, can match anything.

2. Discussion

This paper proposes renaming this particular term as indicated above.  Also, it
is defined in chapter 5 and used only in chapter 16; therefore it proposes
moving the definition to chapter 16 immediately before its use.

3. Edits to 02-007r3

[74:8] Delete.
{Incorrect misplaced definition.}
   
[397:21-] Insert new paragraph
  "Two dummy arguments are <<distinguishable>> if neither is a subroutine and
   neither is TKR compatible with the other."
{Revised definition.}
   
[397:23,398:2,4,8,11] Change "TKR incompatible" to "distinguishable", 5 times.
{Use new term.}
