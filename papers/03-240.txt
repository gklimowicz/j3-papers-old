Subject:  Description of inheritance

All page:line refs herein refer to J3/03-007.

Paper N1524 (J3/03-201), in its discussion of paper 03-188r1,
complains about the description of inheritance and overriding.
In particular, we can't seem to make up our mind whether an
overriding binding stops the parent binding from being inherited
or not.  I think our words are self-contradictory and rely on the
reader understanding what we meant instead of what we said.
This paper proposes words that I think actually say what we
mean.

I think that what we mean to say is that a binding from the parent
is inherited *UNLESS* it is overridden.  That doesn't seem hard to
say, so I propose that we say it.

While on the subject, we correct the omission in the glossary
definition.

[432:27] "Components or" -> "Type parameters, components, or"

[59:10-11]  Replace first sentence with
  "An extended type includes all of the type parameters, all of the
   components, and the nonoverridden (4.5.6.2) nonfinal procedure
   bindings of its parent type."

[60:2-4] Delete "inherited"  twice, resulting in
  "If a nongeneric binding specified in a type definition has the
   same binding name as a binding from the parent type then the
   binding specified in the type definition <<overrides>> the
   one from the parent type."

[60:5,7,15] "inherited"->"overridden" (3 times)
