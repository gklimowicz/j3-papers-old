NUMBER:
TITLE: Unformatted i/o and private components
KEYWORDS: UNFORMATTED, INPUT/OUTPUT, PRIVATE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider
  Module M
    Type T
      Private
      Real :: UDATA(100)
    End Type
  End Module
  ...
  Type(T) X
  ...
  Write (10,*) X  ! Formatted Write
  Write (20)   X  ! Unformatted Write

Both of the WRITE statements were not valid Fortran 95.

Are either of them valid Fortran 2003?

According to [193:9-12], the formatted WRITE statement is not valid.

But the corresponding paragraph for unformatted WRITEs, at [193:1-5],
only forbids private components when some component of T would itself
be handled by user-defined derived-type input/output.  That does not
seem to be consistent.

DISCUSSION:

The "shall not be pointers or allocatables" part of the [193-:1-5]
paragraph is repeated later, at [193:13-15].  This makes no mention
of accessibility.

ANSWER:

Both cases were intended to be invalid.
An edit is supplied to repair the requirements for unformatted i/o.

EDIT:

[193:13-15] Replace paragraph
  "If a derived-type list item is not processed by a user-defined
   derived-type input/output procedure and is not treated as a list of
   its individual components, all the subcomponents of that list item
   shall be accessible in the scoping unit containing the input/output
   statement and shall not be pointers or allocatable".
