Subject:   Some more loose ends
From:      Van Snyder
Reference: 02-284r2


While investigating Richard Maine's concerns about the description of one
aspect of host association on page 402, I decided to compare that
description to the description of the parallel problem and its solution
with respect to use association.  Even though the situation with respect
to use association is much more clearly described, it is still rather
rough.  This paper attempts to tie up a few loose ends in this area.  It
is an attempt to finish the work begun in 02-284r, which is incorporated
into the US position laid out in 03-107r1.

[248:28-36]  It's not a USE statement, but use association, that gives
access to entities.  Editor: ``a USE statement'' => ``use association'' at
[248:28]; ``USE statements'' => ``use association'' at [248:29]; ``a USE
statement'' => ``use association'' at [248:30]; ``contains the USE
statement'' => ``accesses the entity by use association'' at [248:32];
``the USE statement'' => ``use association'' at [248:36].

[248:31-34] An entity declared using a type declaration statement and then
accessed as a function in an executable statement in the same scoping unit
as the type declaration thereby acquires the external attribute.  We don't
want this to happen if an entity declared only by a type declaration
statement is accessed by use association and then referenced as a
function.  One can deduce this by proving a theorem involving [249:1-5]
but it's easierto observe if we don't exclude executable statements here. 
Editor: Delete ``nonexecutable'' at [248:31]; replace ``and'' by a comma
at [248:33]; insert ``, or a deferred type parameter may become defined or
undefined'' after ``attribute'' at [248:34].

[248:31] There are more attributes, and ways to specify them, than laid
out in 5.1.2.  In particular, the general definition of the term
``attribute'' is at [67:2-3].  Editor: Insert a cross reference to
Section 5 before the reference to 5.1.2 at [248:31].
