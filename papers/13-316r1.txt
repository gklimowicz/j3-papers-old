Subject: deleting arithmetic if (UK-10.1a)
Date: 2013 October 14

Reference: N1982

UK-10 subitem 1a., accepted at Delft, is to delete
the arithmetic if statement.  This paper proposes
specifications, syntax, and edits to do so.

Specification:
The Arithmetic IF statement is deleted in f15.

Syntax:
IF( <scalar-numeric-expr> ) lbl_1, lbl_2, lbl_3
is no longer valid Fortran.

Edits: {against 10-007r1}

[intro] Add new feature
        "The arithmetic IF statement has been deleted from \thisstd{}.".

{remove from definition of branch target statement}

[4:39] delete "arithmetic IF statement,"

{add compatibility statement}

[24:7+] add section 1.6.1+
"Fortran 2008 compatibility
Except for the deleted features noted in Annex B.1a,
this part of ISO/IEC 1539 is an upward compatible extension
to the preceding Fortran International Standard, ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010
(Fortran 2008)."

{remove from list of <action-stmt> R214}

[30:6] delete "<<or>> <arithmetic-if-stmt>,"

{remove from discussion of real zero}

[54:14] append "and".

[54:17-18] delete ", and ... arithmetic IF".

{remove from constraint C816 on terminal statements of non-block DO}
[175:14] change "an <arithmetic-if-stmt," to "a"
{NOTE: This text is all going to be deleted anyway by 13-317.}

{remove from constraint C818 on terminal statements of non-block DO}

[175:27] change "an <arithmetic-if-stmt," to "a"
{NOTE: This text is all going to be deleted anyway by 13-317.}

{remove from discussion of Branch Concepts}

[187:1] delete "an arithmetic IF statement,"

{remove subclaus 8.2.4}

[187:20-28] delete subclaus 8.2.4 including note 8.28

{change section heading}

[463:4] after "features" add "from Fortran 90"

[463:5] Change "The" to "These"

{add to deleted features}

[463:41+] add a new section
"B.1a Deleted features from Fortran 2008

These deleted features are those features of Fortran 2008
that were redundant and considered largely unused.

The following Fortran 2008 features are not required."

{start a numbered list}

"(1) Arithmetic IF statement

The arithmetic IF statement is incompatible with IEEE 754
and necessarily involves the use of statement labels;
Statement labels can hinder optimization,
and make code hard to read and maintain.  Similar logic
can be more clearly encoded using other choice statements."

{remove from Obsolescent Features}

[464:6] delete item (1)

{remove from D.1 syntax extract}

[533] delete in rule R214 "<<or>> <arithmetic-if-stmt>,"

{remove from D.2 syntax rule cross-reference}

[572] delete "R853 <arithmetic-if-stmt> R214, C816, C818, C848"

{remove from index}

[586] delete "arithmetic IF statement 187, 187"
and "<arithmetic-if-stmt> (R853), 30, 175, 187, 187"
