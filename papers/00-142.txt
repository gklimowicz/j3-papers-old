	Subj:	Rules for voting on Fortran 95 Interpretations

	Here are the rules for voting on interpretation requests against
	the Fortran 95 standard:

	0.  All interpretations are listed in J3 standing document 006.

	1.  Interpretations are processed by the J3/interp group and given
	    a number.  An answer is formulated and presented to J3 in a
	    meeting paper.

	2.  J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting;  a simple majority
	    vote marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

	3.  Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter
	    ballot to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed
	    by J3 meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  Not voting
	    on a J3 letter ballot is equivalent to missing a J3 meeting, with
	    subsequent negative effects on J3 membership.  An interp answer
	    passes by a 2/3rds vote;  a no vote must be accompanied by an
	    explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's vote
	    to yes.

	    J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
	    study even if the answer passes.

	4.  The chair of J3/interp gathers all interp answers that are marked
	    "passed by J3 letter ballot" and forwards them to the WG5
	    convenor.  The WG5 convenor holds a 30-day WG5 letter ballot.
	    An answer passes with a 2/3rds vote of the members {ie, an
	    individual vote not a country vote};  a no vote must be accompanied
	    by an explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's
	    vote to yes.

	    J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
	    study even if the answer passes.

	5.  "WG5 approved" answers are processed into a corrigendum document
	    by taking the edits from the interp answers {without page and
	    line number information}.  A resolution is passed at a WG5 meeting
	    to forward the corrigendum to SC22.
