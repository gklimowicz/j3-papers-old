Subject: Edits for UK comment MTC1 (Reword "NONKIND")
Date: 11 February 2003

Comment MTC1 of the UK vote was:

    Reword "NONKIND" as "EXTENT"

    NONKIND excludes the possibility of extending to other non-
    kind parameters in future.

When looking at the edits for this, we came to the conclusion that
'extent' would not be a good word because it is already being used with
another meaning.  We think 'length' with the keyword LEN is better.  It
is what we already have for character and we are all familiar with it.

Here are the edits for this:

Global edit: Change every occurrence of 'NONKIND' to 'LEN' and
    every occurrence of 'nonkind' to 'length'.

32:14+. Change NOTE 4.3 to

   NOTE 4.3

   The adjective 'length' is used for type parameters other than kind
   type parameters because they often specify a length, as for
   intrinsic character type. However, they may be used for other
   purposes. The important difference from kind type parameters is that
   their values need not be known at compile time and often change
   during execution.
