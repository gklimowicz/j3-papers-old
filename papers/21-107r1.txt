1. Introduction

This paper is triggered by the Editor's comment in 21-100 on a lack of
examples in section 18.2.3 of 21-007. In the course of setting these up,
a minor issue was observed, for which a fix is also suggested.

Specifically,

* For 18.2.3.2 C_ASSOCIATED it is suggested to replace NOTE 1 by
  an example that illustrates both usage cases.

* For 18.2.3.3 C_F_POINTER a spurious "Case (iv)" is referenced in the
  example section for which there is no counterpart in the FPTR arguments'
  description.

* For 18.2.3.4 C_F_PROCPOINTER an example is added.

* For 18.2.3.5 C_F_STRPOINTER examples for use of both specifics are
  added.

* For 18.2.3.6 C_FUNLOC an example is added.

* For 18.2.3.7 C_LOC an example is added, as well as a reference to
  an earlier example.

* For 18.2.3.8 C_SIZEOF an example is added.

* For 18.2.3.9 F_C_STRING an example is added.


2. Edits against 21-007

In 18.2.3.2 C_ASSOCIATED [488:12+] replace NOTE 1 by a new para 6

"Examples.
 Case (i): extern double c_x;
           void *address_of_x (void)
           {
              return &c_x;
           }

           TYPE(c_ptr) ::    p = c_null_ptr
           ...
           ! Assume interface to "address_of_x" is available.
	   ! The following IF block will be executed:
           IF ( .NOT. C_Associated(p) ) THEN
             p = address_of_x()
           END IF

 Case (ii): Assume that the C variable c_x from the previous example is
            bound to Fortran by a module variable declaration
	
	    Real(C_double), Target, BIND(C, Name='c_x') :: x

            Then, the IF block of

            If ( C_Associated(p, C_loc(x)) ) Then
               ...
            End If

            will be executed if the executable statements are placed
	    after those from the Case(i) example."


In 18.2.3.3 C_F_POINTER [490:7] delete "Case (iv)" and unindent [490:7-14]
by one level.


In 18.2.3.4 C_F_PROCPOINTER after [490:26] add a new para 4

"Example.
      #include <math.h>

      typedef double (*simplefun)(double);

      simplefun dispatch() {
        return erfc;
      }

      ! Assume interface to "dispatch" is available.
      Abstract Interface
         Real(C_double) Function simple_function(x) Bind(C)
           Import :: C_Double
           Real(C_Double), Value :: x
         End Function simple_function
      End Interface

      Procedure(simple_function), Pointer :: psimp

      Call C_F_Procpointer(dispatch(), psimp)

      ! Invoke erfc via psimp
      Write(*,*) psimp(4.5_C_Double)"


In 18.2.3.5 C_F_STRPOINTER after [491:12] add a new para 5

"Example.

      Assume that interfaces to the C library routines "free" and
      "get_current_dir_name" are available. Furthermore, a constant

      Integer, Parameter :: maxlen = 1000

      is taken to be the maximum expected length of the strings
      involved.

      The following procedure fragment indicates how a Fortran
      implementation of a call with C prototype
      void process_handle(..., char[], ...);
      can process the passed C string:

      Subroutine process_string(..., str, ...) Bind(C)
         Character(Kind=C_char), Dimension(*), Target :: str
         ...
         Character(Kind=C_char, Len=:), Pointer :: f_str
	
         Call C_F_strpointer(str, f_str, maxlen)
	 ! f_str is now pointing at storage associated with the
	 ! C string actual parameter
         ...
      End Subroutine process_string

      The following statements indicate how to process the string returned
      by a C library routine:

      Character(kind=C_Char, Len=:), Pointer :: f_str => Null()

      Call C_F_Strpointer(get_current_dir_name(), f_str, maxlen)
      ! f_str is now pointing at storage associated with the string
      ! returned by the C library call
      ...
      ! clean up allocation done by the C library call
      Call free(C_Loc(f_str))
      f_str => Null()

      For both scenarios, the value of the length of f_str will be that of
      the strlen() C library call for the corresponding C string, unless
      that value exceeds maxlen."

(Thanks to Steve Lionel for suggesting significant improvements).

In 18.2.3.6 C_FUNLOC after [491:24] add a new para 7

"Example.
    Interface
       Subroutine qsort(base, nmemb, size, compar) Bind(C)
          Import :: c_ptr, c_size_t, c_funptr
          Type(*), Dimension(*) :: base
          Integer(C_Size_T), Value :: nmemb, size
          Type(C_Funptr), Value :: compar
       End Subroutine qsort
       Integer(C_Int) Function reverse_compare(a, b) Bind(C)
          Import :: C_Int
          Type(*) :: a, b
       End Function
    End Interface

    Using either a Fortran or a C implementation of "reverse_compare",
    the C library function "qsort" can be called as follows.

    Integer(C_Size_T), Parameter :: nmemb = 10
    Integer(C_Int) :: iarr(nmemb) = [ 1, 4, 7, 3, 8, 10, 2, 5, 9, 6 ]

    Call qsort(iarr, nmemb, C_Sizeof(iarr(1)), C_Funloc(reverse_compare))
    ! iarr now contains the reverse-sorted permutation of its input value"

In 18.2.3.7 C_LOC after [492:3] add a new para 10

"Example.

      Type(*), Intent(in), Target :: x
      Real(C_Float), Pointer :: pr => null()

      If "x" is argument associated with an object of type REAL(C_FLOAT),
      execution of the following statements, with the effect of effectively
      processing "x", is permissible:

      Call C_F_Pointer(C_Loc(x), pr)
      Write(*, '("x is a real scalar with value: ",F8.1)') pr

      An example of how to use C_LOC on an array object of non-
      interoperable type is supplied in 18.2.3.3, for Case (ii) of that
      section."


In 18.2.3.8 C_SIZEOF after [492:15] add a new para 7

"Example.
      Type, Bind(C) :: struct
         Character(Len=1,Kind=C_Char) :: s(3)
         Real(C_Double) :: d
      End Type struct

      Type(struct) :: obj(4)

      Execution of the statement

      Write(*,*) C_Sizeof(obj(1))

      will produce the same value in the output as

      Write(*,*) Storage_Size(obj) / Storage_Size(obj(1)%s)

      NOTE 1:
      Due to padding imposed by the companion processor, the value returned
      for derived type objects might be larger than the sum of C_SIZEOF
      values calculated for each type component individually."


In 18.2.3.9 F_C_STRING after [492:34] add a new para

"Example.

  CHARACTER(LEN=9,KIND=c_char) :: str = 'abcdef    '
  CHARACTER(LEN=:,KIND=c_char), ALLOCATABLE :: res

  res = F_C_STRING(str, .TRUE.)
  ! res is allocated to length 10, with '\0' as last character

  res = F_C_STRING(str)
  ! res is allocated to length 7, with '\0' as last character"
