Subject:   Additional co_reduce example
Date: 2015 July 06
Reference: TS 18508

1. Introduction
===============

Due in part to desirable space limitations, the MyAdd example
demonstrating co_reduce in 8.4.13 of TS 18508 (19 May 2015) appears
to be redundant with co_sum.  It would be helpful to demonstrate the
use of co_reduce in a way that extends the language rather than
recreating an existing capability.

2. Proposal
===========

Add an example of co_reduce in A.4.1 of TS 18508 that demonstrates
how to extend to extend an existing language intrinsic to create its
natural collective counterpart.

3. Edits
========

[53:29] Insert the following pararaph and code example:

The subroutine below demonstrates how to use co_reduce to create
a collective counterpart to the "all" intrinsic function:

  subroutine co_all(boolean)
    logical, intent(inout) :: boolean
    call co_reduce(boolean,both)
  contains
    pure function both(lhs,rhs) result(lhs_and_rhs)
      logical, intent(in) :: lhs,rhs
      logical :: lhs_and_rhs
      lhs_and_rhs = lhs .and. rhs
    end function
  end subroutine
