Subject: Normal program termination (Issue 241)

At program termination, except in the case of termination due to an
error condition, connected units are closed (Section 9.4.6
[178:31-33]). The current text does not explicitly address the case of
termination inside a procedure defined by a companion processor such
as C. Connected units should be closed if the program is terminated
normally by a C procedure. Rather than add interoperability text to
the section on the CLOSE statement, the concept of "normal
termination" is added in section 2 and referenced in sections 9.4.6
(CLOSE), 2.3.3 (END), and 8.4 (STOP).

Edits are against 01-007r1

Edit: [15:3]
replace "causes termination of execution"
with    "causes normal termination of execution"

Edit: after [15:22] insert
"Normal termination of execution of the program occurs if a STOP
statement is executed or if an END statement is executed in the main
program. Normal termination of execution of the program also may occur
during execution of a procedure defined by a companion processor. (C
Standard 5.1.2.2.3 and 7.20.4.3). If normal termination of
execution occurs within a Fortran program unit and the program
incorporates procedures defined by a companion processor, the process
of execution termination shall include the effect of executing the C
exit() function (C Standard 7.20.4.3)."

Edit: [163:37]
replace "causes termination of execution of the program."
with    "causes normal termination of execution of the program."

Edit:  [178:15]
replace "at the termination of"
with    "at the normal termination of"

Edit:  [178:31]

replace 
"At termination of execution of the program for reasons other than an error condition"

with 
"At normal termination of execution of the program"

Edit:  [178:34-43] Delete Unresolved issue 241
