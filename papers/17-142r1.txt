Subject: Deallocate description doesn't say all images must be consistent
Date: 2017 June 27

1. Discussion
=============

9.7.1.4 says that a coarray shall not become allocated on any image
unless it is successfully allocated on all active images of the team.

There is no similar requirement for deallocation. There should be.

This paper is a response for Ballot Comment US010.
