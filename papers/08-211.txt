Hello,

Fortran 2008 adds the BESSEL_YN and BESSEL_JN intrinsic procedures.
These are special in so far that they belong into two classes:

Class.
Case (i): BESSEL_JN (N,X) is an elemental function.
Case (ii): BESSEL_JN (N1,N2,X) is a transformational function.

Having a procedure of dual nature is confusing and conceptually
inconsistent. Furthermore, it increases the implementation burden for
the compiler vendor.

Additionally, I do not not see the need for the transformational
function; the same functionality can easily gained by using the
elemental function.

I therefore strongly prefer to make BESSEL_YN and BESSEL_JN only
elemental functions. If a burning need is seen for a BESSEL_*N(N1,N2,X)
function (which I do not see), one should add a new intrinsic with a
different name.
