From: Toon Moene
Subject: The new COMPLEX intrinsic.
Date: 2008 August 13

Rationale:

There is a need expressed for an intrinsic function that constructs
a complex number from two real numbers with equal kind type
parameters yielding a result value having the same kind type parameter.

[317 after COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT]

"COMPLEX      (RE, IM)    E   Conversion to complex type with the same
                              kind type parameter as RE and IM."

[337 after 13.7.37]

"13.7.37+ <<COMPLEX(RE, IM)>>

 <<Description.>>  Conversion to complex type.

 <<Class.>>  Elemental function.

 <<Arguments.>>  RE and IM are of type real with the same kind type
                 parameter.

 <<Result Characteristics.>>  Complex with the same kind type parameter
                              as RE and IM.

 <<Result value.>>  The complex number with real part RE and imaginary
                    part IM.

 <<Example.>>  COMPLEX(A, B) is (3.0, 4.5) if A has the value 3.0 and
               B has the value 4.5."
