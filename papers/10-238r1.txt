NUMBER:  F03/0030
TITLE:  IEEE divide by zero
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, divide-by-zero
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is infinity / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?
Is NaN / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?

Fortran 2003 defines (in 14.2) infinity / zero and NaN / zero
cases as IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO.  IEEE-754 defines (in 6.1 and 6.2)
those two as unexceptional.

ANSWER:

On an IEEE-conformant processor, these cases do not raise exceptions
(see clauses 6.1 and 6.2 of IEC 60559:1989).

The definitions in 14.2 were intended to describe IEC 60559:1989
exceptions with sufficient latitude to allow use on machines that do
not conform to IEC 60559:1989.  However, the definition of
IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO is not consistent with IEC 60559:1989.

Furthermore, the definition of the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag is also not
consistent with IEC 60559:1989, because this exception is not raised
for operations on infinite operands.

Additionally, if the data type is not an IEEE data type, but the
exception is supported, the circumstances under which the exception is
raised are processor dependent.

[403:7-9] Clause 14.3, first paragraph, first bullet (IEEE_OVERFLOW),
  Replace with
  "IEEE_OVERFLOW occurs in an intrinsic real addition, subtraction,
   multiplication, division, or conversion by the intrinsic function
   REAL, as specified by IEC 60559:1989 if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is
   true for the result of the operation or conversion, and as
   determined by the processor if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE for the result
   is not true.  It occurs in an intrinsic real exponentiation as
   determined by the processor.  It occurs in a complex operation, or
   conversion by the intrinsic function CMPLX, if it is caused by the
   calculation of the real or imaginary part of the result."

[403:10-11] Replace with
  "IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO occurs in a real division as specified by IEC
   60559:1989 if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is true for the result of the
   division, and as determined by the processor if
   IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE for the result is not true.  It is
   processor-dependent whether it occurs in a real exponentiation with
   a negative exponent.  It occurs in a complex division if it is
   caused by the calculation of the real or imaginary part of the
   result."
