1.  Introduction

Interp F03/0076 concluded that an external procedure having a given
binding label has to have the same procedure name in every scope.

It was suggested that this ought to be changed in f2008.

Edits were suggested in 08-187 that would result in the names of
external procedures that have binding labels being local identifiers.

Those edits are reproduced here, applied to 08-007r2.

2.  Edits w.r.t. 08-007r2

In [439: 16.2p1] replace the second "external procedure" with "external
procedure for which a binding label is not specified", replace "such
global entity" with "such entity" [this is cannonball polishing], and
replace "except ... program" with "except that the name of such an
entity may be the same as the name of an intrinsic module".

{Makes the Fortran name of an external procedure a global identifier
only if it doesn't have a binding label.}

In [440: 16.3.1p1(1)] append "external procedures for which a binding
label is specified," at the end of the item.

{Makes the Fortran name of an external procedure a local identifier if
it has a binding label.}

This is not a problem because a procedure that has a binding label is
required to have explicit interface (see 12.4.2.2p1(5)).
