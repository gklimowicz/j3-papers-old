Discussion:

In section 11.6.11 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control
statements, the paragraph discussing the behavior of the STAT=
specifier for LOCK and UNLOCK statements states that the stat-variable
becomes defined with a "positive integer value" that is different from
the named integer constant STAT values defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
module.  Elsewhere in the standard, the phrase "processor-dependent
positive integer value" is used for "other" error conditions that
do not have a named integer constant specifier.  Edits are provided to
make this wording consistent. This processor dependence is covered in
Annex A by the bullet

[536:21-22] o the positive integer values assigned to the stat-variable
              as the result of an error condition (9.7.4, 11.6.11);

Edit to N2123:

[218:9] In 11.6.11 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control
statements, p9 change

    "positive integer" to

    "processor-dependent positive integer"
