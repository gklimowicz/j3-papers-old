Hotel Telephone Usage: The hotel charges $0.50 for local telephone
     calls and for connections to toll free long distance numbers.
     However, the surcharges for long distance calls and international
     calls can be very large.  It is recommended that all long dist-
     ance and international calls being placed from your hotel room
     be made using a prepaid calling card.  Such prepaid calling
     cards can be purchased very inexpensively from many department
     stores, convenience stores, and discount buying clubs.  The
     hotel will still charge $0.50 for each call made with a prepaid
     calling card, but there are no additional hotel surcharges on
     long distance or international calls made with prepaid calling
     cards.
