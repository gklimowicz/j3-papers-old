Subj:  F2003 edits for F95 Interp 000099


The edits for F95 specified in interp 000099 were:

    [79:40-41] Delete "The ... statement."
    [80:6] Append to paragraph
      "No array bound in an ALLOCATE statement shall depend on
       the value of the <stat-variable>."

Since interp 000099 was approved at the last WG5 meeting, it
seems sppropriate to make equivalent changes in the F2003 draft.

EDITS: In 03-007, make the following changes:
[111:30] insert "the value of" before "stat-variable"
[111:31] insert "the value of" before "errmsg-variable"
[111:31,34] insert " length type parameters," after "bounds,"  twice

end of edits
