2.1 F2008 Plenary

** /WG5 **  << begin N1926 - WG5 minutes excerpts >>

2.6 Approval of the minutes of the Garching 2011 Meeting [N1860]

The minutes of the previous meeting were approved.

3. Matters arising from the minutes

There were no items not otherwise on the agenda.

4. Status of Garching 2011 Resolutions [N1861]

The first corrigendum has been approved by SC22, and publication is imminent.

5. Reports

5.1 SC22 Matters

We met the deadline for the Further Interoperability with C TS, and voting has
started on that; it will end on the 26th August 2012.

There has been a suggestion to eliminate the CD stage of processing of
standards, to make things quicker.  John Reid and Dan Nagle were both concerned
about this as the CD stage is where country comments are collected to decide on
the final technical content of the standard.  (It is possible that the FCD
stage would remain, the suggestion is unclear.)  There was a short discussion
about the desirability and potential consequences of this possibility.

The next SC22 meeting is in September.

5.2 National Activity Reports

Canada: The languages committee meets every 3 months.  There is not a lot of
        activity within this committee as most of the Fortran people are within
        IBM.
Germany: There is not a lot of Fortran standards activity in Germany.
Japan: N1920 is the Japanese National activity report.  The major topic is the
       translation of Fortran 2008, they are working on technical terms now and
       will take at least 2 more years to finish.
Netherlands: Fortran standards matters are dealt with by the general
             programming languages committee, which meets twice a year.
UK: The activity report is in N1922.  The BSI Fortran panel operates by email.
    Congratulations to Malcolm Cohen for receiving the IEC 1906 award.
USA: PL22.3 meets three times a year, usually in Las Vegas.  Recent technical
     work has been on the Further Interoperability with C TS, interpretation
     requests, and investigating technical features for the putative Coarray TS.

5.3 Report from Primary Development Body (INCITS/PL22.3)

Some members would like to engage in substantial new work items, but the
committee is not in consensus.

5.4 Reports from other Development Bodies (Editors/Heads)

Interoperability TS: Bill Long
The draft TS is in its final vote at the moment.

Coarray TS: Bill Long
There are no contents for this TS at present, as we are still developing the
requirements.

8. Construct a draft Fortran annex for the TR on "Guidance to Avoiding 
   Vulnerabilities in Programming Languages through Language Selection and Use".

There was a presentation by Dan Nagle on the purposes and approach of the WG23
Technical Report.  TS 24772 is not a coding standard, but is intended to
contain advice for people who are drawing up coding standards.

A straw vote was taken on whether there should be a Fortran annex to this
Technical Report; the result was 8 yes - 1 no - 3 undecided.  A subgroup
consisting of Dan Nagle, John Reid, Masayuki Takata and Malcolm Cohen will
process the current draft of this proposed annex during the meeting.

 
6. Consider the technical content of the proposed TS on Further Coarray
   Features.

There was a further presentation by Bill Long on items for the proposed TS,
with further technical discussion on features presented on Monday.

At the end of the technical discussion John Reid led a discussion on the
overall size of the TS.  A short presentation by Malcolm Cohen on how the TS
could fit into a revised WG5 Strategic Plan suggested that the complexity of
the TS should be limited.  It was suggested that items that were too
complicated for the desired size of the TS could be developed independently for
potential inclusion in a future revision of the Fortran standard.  No vote was
taken at this time.

A series of straw votes was taken on the technical contents of the proposed
TS as follows; most of these were 4-way votes with the choices being
   - in the TS now,
   - defer to the next revision of the Fortran standard,
   - never include the feature,
   - undecided.

Collective subroutines: 10 - now, 0 - defer, 0 - never, 2 - undecided.
A subsequent straw vote on whether these should be image control statements was
7 - yes, 4 - no, 1 - undecided.

Atomic operations were divided into three groups:
  (1) compare and swap, add, bitwise and, bitwise or, bitwise exclusive or;
  (2) swap;
  (3) combined bitwise exclusive or and bitwise and.
Atomic operations group 1: 11 - now, 0 - defer, 0 - never, 1 - undecided.
Atomic operations group 2: 2 - now, 0 - defer, 0 - never, 10 - undecided.
Atomic operations group 3: 2 - now, 2 - defer, 1 - never, 7 - undecided.

There are two competing models for "teams", one being the "partition model"
where partitions (teams) are formed by splitting an existing partition (team)
and image numbers are all team-relative, and the other being the
previously-described "team model" where teams are formed by listing the
participating images.  Separate straw votes were taken on each approach.

Teams - "partition model": 9 - now, 2 - defer, 0 - never, 1 - undecided.
Teams - "previous team model": 0 - now, 6 - defer, 4 - never, 2 - undecided.

In a discussion of how to integrate teams into the language, there was a
general consensus that this would be best done by having the use of teams be
scoped by syntactic constructs.

For events, the proposals were divided into two: the most basic feature
("simple" events) being simply to send/wait/query on events, and the more
advanced events including "put with notify".  Two straw votes were taken on the
technical details:
  (1) Should simple events be image control statements?
      11 - yes, 0 - no, 1 - undecided
  (2) Should advanced events be available?
      3 - yes, 1 - no, 8 - undecided.
Following this an overall straw vote on desirability was taken on simple
events: 10 - now, 0 - defer, 0 - never, 2 - undecided.

Two straw votes were taken whether to include parallel I/O facilities:
 (1) for direct access files: 6 - now, 3 - defer, 0 - never, 3 - undecided.
 (2) for sequential access: 3 - now, 6 - defer, 1 - never, 2 - undecided.

Finally a straw vote was taken on whether to include copointers:
  0 - now, 6 - defer, 4 - never, 2 - undecided.

** /J3 **

2.3 Subgroup meetings

Following these straw votes the meeting divided into three subgroups
/HPC: to develop the coarray TS proposals in light of these straw votes;
/JOR: to develop the vulnerabilities annex for WG23;
/INTERP: to process defect reports on Fortran 2008.

2.4 Subgroup reports (4:30pm)

On reconvening, Bill Long reported on the progress made in resolving the more
undecided issues from the straw votes; a revised requirements paper is being
developed.  Dan Nagle reported on the progress made on the vulnerabilities
annex; a new draft is available on the J3 server.  Malcolm Cohen reported that
the /INTERP subgroup were about halfway through processing the results of the
letter ballot that ended just before the meeting, and expected to need two more
subgroup sessions to finish this and to process the new defect reports for this
meeting.

     The list of papers for voting, discussion, or action later in
     the week was discussed.

           (Cohen/Lionel) - uc

** /WG5 **  << begin N1926 - WG5 minutes excerpts >>

6. Consider the technical content of the proposed TS on Further Coarray
   Features.

There was a presentation by Bill Long on the technical details of events.  Two
different kinds of events are widely available: LOGICAL, and INTEGER (most
systems have both).  Event operations are POST, CLEAR, TEST, and WAIT; for a
LOGICAL event, a POST operation on an event that has already been posted is a
either a null operation or an error.
  sv Logical/Integer/Both/Undecided?  0-11-0-1.

7. Consider the Fortran defect reports (interpretations) in J3-006. 

The results of the recently-concluded J3 letter ballot on interpretation
requests were announced: 28 passed unchanged, and 13 passed with minor
amendments.  It was agreed to have a WG5 letter ballot with the 41 that passed
shortly after the meeting, and to aim for producing a Corrigendum 2 within the
year.

12.1 Future meetings

A discussion was held as to whether to meet in London in 2014 or 2015; a straw
vote was inconclusive: 4 - 2014, 3 - 2015, 5 - undecided.

8. Construct a draft Fortran annex for the TR on "Guidance to Avoiding 
   Vulnerabilities in Programming Languages through Language Selection and Use".

The revised draft of the Fortran annex, which will become N1929 when complete,
was presented and discussed.

6. Consider the technical content of the proposed TS on Further Coarray
   Features.

Bill Long reported that further progress had been made on developing the
requirements, and that subgroup now strongly recommended that collective
subroutine references not be image control statements (the previous straw vote
being in favour of them being such).  After discussion, it was agreed that this
was acceptable but that a reference to a collective subroutine should not be
permitted in places where an image control statement would not be permitted.

           Question is whether the finalizer gets called even if a deallocate

             Malcolm argues in favor of option c, make it processor dependent
             whether the final routine is called if the deallocate fails. Option
             C allows implementation of A if the vendor thinks it can.

10. WG5 Business and Strategic Plans

The convenor drew the meeting's attention to the draft of his upcoming report
to SC22 and requested input.

10.1 Goals for 2012-2014

Revision of the strategic plan was discussed considering the UK position
paper N1923.  It was agreed that we should aim to produce a TS on further
coarray features as soon as possible, and to produce a revision of the standard
that consolidates the two Technical Specifications, corrigenda and editorial
improvements approximately two years after that.  This revision would
concentrate on consolidation and removal of small inconsistencies in existing
features and their interaction, and not add any large new features.

5.5 Liaison reports

IFIP/WG2.5: Van Snyder

The IFIP WG 2.5 liaison report, document N1931, was briefly discussed.

6. Consider the technical content of the proposed TS on Further Coarray
   Features.

Further discussion was held on the technical requirements for this TS.  It was
agreed that the connection of the standard input file to image 1 needed to be
clarified as applying to image 1 of the initial team.  For the collectives, it
was agreed that execution of a collective should be required to be the same
statement on each participating image.

A straw vote on whether the atomic compare-and-swap subroutine should be
abbreviated to CAS or spelled out in full was taken, with the result being
6 - CAS, 4 - COMPARE_AND_SWAP, 2 - undecided.

A short discussion decided on the name for the proposed TS.
   
9. Decide whether a publicly available Fortran 2008 module could provide 
   an adequate replacement for the functions of Part 2 of the Fortran 
   Standard that are not available in Part 1. 

The issues regarding ISO/IEC 1539-2 were considered by a subgroup consisting of
John Reid and Dan Nagle; they reported that
   (i) changing a program that used the iso_varying_string module to use the
       F2003 features instead was non-trivial;
   (ii) John Reid's experimental version of the iso_varying_string module that
        used the new features appeared to be successful, but that significant
        work would be required to bring it up to publishable standard.

Given that the varying string part (1539-2) has been confirmed as a standard by
ISO for the next 5 years, subgroup recommended that no further action be taken
on this issue at this time.

8. Construct a draft Fortran annex for the TR on "Guidance to Avoiding 
   Vulnerabilities in Programming Languages through Language Selection and Use".

A new revision of the draft annex was produced and comments requested.

12.1 Future meetings

A further discussion was held; it was generally agreed that it was desirable to
alternate between North America and elsewhere, and that therefore that assuming
the 2013 meeting in Delft went ahead as planned, the 2014 should be in Las
Vegas and the 2015 meeting should be in London.  For 2014, the proposed dates
are 23-27 June.

** /WG5 **  << begin N1926 - WG5 minutes excerpts >>

The meeting began with a final discussion of the Strategic Plan and the draft
Resolutions.

6. Consider the technical content of the proposed TS on Further Coarray
   Features.

Bill Long led a discussion of the latest draft of the requirements document for
the proposed TS; the agreed result is document N1930.

8. Construct a draft Fortran annex for the TR on "Guidance to Avoiding 
   Vulnerabilities in Programming Languages through Language Selection and Use".

Dan Nagle led the discussion.  All comments received have been incorporated
into the document N1929 for letter ballot after the meeting.

12. Adoption of Resolutions (N1927)

Resolutions M1, M2, M3, M11 and M12 were approved by unanimous acclaim.
Resolutions M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9 and M10 were approved by unanimous consent.

M1.  Appreciation of Project Editor

M2.  Appreciation for Corrigendum 1

M3.  Appreciation for Further C Interoperability Development

M4.  Varying Length Strings
WG5 expresses its thanks to John Reid for investigating the level of
effort needed to bring the complete ISO_VARYING_STRING functionality
into the current standard using character variables instead of objects
of a derived type.  WG5 notes that converting the procedures of Part 2
of the Standard, ISO/IEC 1539-2:1994, to work in the same way is neither
trivial nor entirely transparent; however, WG5 decides that, with the
renewal of Part 2, no further action is needed at this time.

M5. Removal of CD Stage from SC22 Process
WG5 directs its convenor to state that a CD stage or equivalent is
needed to obtain comments on the technical content of standards from the
public.  This is because no Working Group, no matter how expert and
experienced, can have the breadth of expertise and understanding of
the range of issues that all users of the standard do, collectively.
WG5 expresses its concern that the quality of standards may suffer if
there is less opportunity for the public to comment on standards before
the technical content is finalised.

M6.  Strategic Plan for WG5
WG5 adopts document WG5-N1925 as its strategic schedule for the next
three years.  WG5 resolves that the next revision shall consist of a
consolidation of the agreed editorial improvements, corrigenda and the
two Technical Specifications into the main standard, plus the removal of
simple deficiencies in, and discrepancies between, existing facilities.
The intent is to resolve issues that have been created by successive
extensions to Fortran, while minimising impact on the standard document,
implementors and other users.  The criterion for deciding whether a
change is simple is that it requires no more than a small amount of
editorial effort and no more than a small amount of implementation
effort.  Furthermore, WG5 resolves that no new significant language
extensions, beyond those mentioned in these resolutions, will be
considered until the process described in this resolution is complete.

M7.  Ballot on Outstanding Interpretations
WG5 directs its convenor to hold a ballot on the outstanding
interpretations agreed by J3, and to produce a corrigendum document
within this year.

M8.  Fortran Annex to TR 24772
WG5 directs its convenor to hold a ballot on document WG5-N1929 as the
Fortran Annex to TR 24772, Guidance to Avoiding Vulnerabilities in
Programming Languages through Language Selection and Use.  WG5 thanks
Dan Nagle as Liaison to WG23, and the Fortran Annex to TR 24772
development body for producing the document.

M9.  Further Parallel Features
WG5 adopts document WG5-N1930 as the requirements for a TS on Additional
Parallel Features in Fortran, and directs its convenor to request SC22
approval to proceed with this as a new work item.  WG5 thanks Bill Long,
John Reid and the Further Parallel TS development body for producing the
document.  WG5 thanks Bill Long for agreeing to be Project Editor.

M10.  Future Meetings
WG5 thanks Toon Moene for inviting WG5 and PL22.3 to meet in Delft, the
Netherlands, on June 24-28 2013, J3 for inviting WG5 and PL22.3 to meet
in Las Vegas, USA, on June 23-27 2014, and Jane Sleighthome and Ian
Chivers for inviting WG5 and PL22.3 to meet in London, UK, in August
2015.
