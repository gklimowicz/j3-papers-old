NUMBER: TBD
TITLE: ASYNCHRONOUS and argument passing
KEYWORD: ASYNCHRONOUS
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION 1:

Is the following program conforming?

PROGRAM Main
    INTEGER, ASYNCHRONOUS :: array(5) = -1
    OPEN (11, FILE='junk', ASYNCHRONOUS='yes', ACTION='read')
    READ (11, *, ASYNCHRONOUS='yes') array
    CALL Fred(array(::2))
    WAIT (11)
    PRINT *, array
    CLOSE(11)
CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE Fred (arg)    ! In general, an external procedure
        INTEGER :: arg(*)    ! Otherwise unused
        CONTINUE    ! In general, something that takes more time
    END SUBROUTINE Fred
END PROGRAM Main


QUESTION 2:

Is the following program conforming?

PROGRAM Main
    USE ISO_C_BINDING
    INTERFACE
        SUBROUTINE Fred (arg) BIND(C)
            USE ISO_C_BINDING
            INTEGER(C_INT) :: arg(*)    ! Otherwise unused
        END SUBROUTINE Fred
    END INTERFACE
    INTEGER(C_INT), ASYNCHRONOUS :: array(5) = -1
    OPEN (11, FILE='junk', ASYNCHRONOUS='yes', ACTION='read')
    READ (11, *, ASYNCHRONOUS='yes') array
    CALL Fred(array(::2))
    WAIT (11)
    PRINT *, array
    CLOSE(11)
END PROGRAM Main

SUBROUTINE Fred (arg) BIND(C)
    USE ISO_C_BINDING
    INTEGER(C_INT) :: arg(*)    ! Otherwise unused
    CONTINUE
END SUBROUTINE Fred


DISCUSSION:

Note that this problem also affects any asynchronous or parallel use,
including OpenMP and coarrays.

It is not excluded by 5.3.4p2, because 'array' is merely associated with
'arg' in subroutine Fred, and not used in an executable statement or
specification expression there.  It will obviously not work if the
copy-in/copy-out mechanism is used, and the actual I/O transfer occurs
while the body of subroutine Fred is being executed.

It might seem that this affects only sequence association, but Fortran
does not forbid the use of copy-in/copy-out for most ordinary dummy
arguments, doing so can sometimes improve performance considerably, and
so it is a standard optimisation.  Obviously, in the case of question 1,
it is a pure pessimisation, but the issue is whether a compiler is
required to recognise that case specially.

Question 2 is there to indicate that there are circumstances when the
copy-in/copy-out needs to be performed by the caller.  Again, Fortran
does not forbid this from being used for any other calls where that
mechanism is needed.

The simplest fix would seem to be to add dummy arguments without the
ASYNCHRONOUS attribute to the excluded uses.  5.3.4p3 and 9.6.2.5p4 mean
that this is unlikely to affect any existing program.


ANSWER:

None of these program are conforming.  Edits are provided to correct the
oversight.


EDITS:

5.3.4p2 change "executable statement" to "dummy argument without the
ASYNCHRONOUS attribute, executable statement".
