Subject: The meaning of pi

A question was raised about the whether the Greek letter $\pi$
used in the specifications of some of the intrinsic procedures
represented the mathematical value or a numerical approximation.
Since  $\pi$ in these contexts is used to specify mathematical
concepts, the correct interpretation is the mathematical value
of $\pi$.

Note to Editor: The notation $\pi$ represents the lower case
Greek letter pi.

In the specifications of the intrinsic procedures, the symbol
$\pi$ represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle
to its diameter.
