From:    David Muxworthy
Subject: UK proposal UK-13 I/O error conditions
Date: 2014 June 23


Status: For Consideration
Basic Functionality:  Standardize certain I/O error conditions

Comment:
This proposal refers only to numeric or logical input errors.
It could be extended to other I/O errors.

Rationale:
Standardize certain I/O error conditions so as to allow a
standard-conforming program to regain control after an error.

Specification:
During execution of a formatted READ statement which includes an
IOSTAT specifier, if the characters input to a numeric or logical
edit descriptor are not acceptable to the processor, the variable
specified in the IOSTAT= specifier shall be defined with a
processor-dependent positive integer value.

Syntax:
No syntax change.

Edits to J3/14-007r1(= N2014):

[240:29] In subclause 9.11.1 General paragraph 1 replace "The" by
"Except as identified in subclause 9.11.2, the".

[241:11+] In subclause 9.11.2 Error conditions and the ERR= specifier,
in the bulleted list, after item (3) add item inset:

(3a) if the statement is a READ statement and it contains an IOSTAT=
specifier, and if the characters input to a value with F, E,
EN, ES, D, G, I, or L editing are not acceptable to the processor,
the variable specified in the IOSTAT= specifier becomes defined
as specified in 9.11.5.
