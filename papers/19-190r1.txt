NUMBER: F18/013
TITLE:  TEAM_NUMBER arguments and intrinsic function are ambiguous
KEYWORDS: NUM_IMAGES, IMAGE_INDEX, TEAM_NUMBER, teams
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

PROGRAM p
   n = NUM_IMAGES()
   n1 = MERGE(1,2,THIS_IMAGE()<2)
   n2 = MERGE(1,3,THIS_IMAGE()<3)
   FORM TEAM(n1,x)
   FORM TEAM(n2,y)
   IF (n1==1) THEN
     CHANGE TEAM (x)
       PRINT *,NUM_IMAGES(TEAM_NUMBER=1) !(A)
       PRINT *,NUM_IMAGES(TEAM_NUMBER=3) !(B)
     END TEAM
   END IF
END PROGRAM

According to 16.9.145 NUM_IMAGES, the TEAM_NUMBER argument
    "shall identify the initial team or a team whose parent is the
     same as that of the current team".

However, at (A), there are two teams with team number 1 and the same
parent, one created by the FORM TEAM with "n1", the other created by
the FORM TEAM with "n2".

At (B), there is only one team with team number 3 and the same parent
as the current team, however, it is not a "sibling" team in that it
was not created by the same FORM TEAM statement.

Referring to the definition of the term "team number" at 3.145.4:
    "-1 which identifies the initial team, or positive integer that
     identifies a team within its parent team"
which has the same flaw in that there could be multiple teams within
the parent team that have that number.

Q1. Was TEAM_NUMBER in NUM_IMAGES, and the "team number" definition,
    intended to limit the identification to teams created by
    corresponding FORM TEAM statement executions?

Q2. The TEAM_NUMBER argument of IMAGE_INDEX suffers from similar
    wording. Was this also intended to be limited to "sibling" teams?

ANSWER:

Yes, this is the intention.  Edits are provided.

The edits use the terminology "corresponding" executions, as execution
on more than one image can hardly be the "same" execution.

The edits also use the term "sibling teams". As sibling teams are
always created as a group, and really only have meaning when there are
more than one, the plural form is probably most appropriate.

EDITS:

OPTIONAL:
[20:27+] Terms and definitions:
  Insert after the definition of "parent team"
  "3.145.3+
   sibling teams
   teams created by a single set of corresponding executions of the
   FORM TEAM statement (11.6.9)"
{I don't think we are using "sibling teams" often enough to warrant a
 special term. Just indexing it should be sufficient.}

[20:30] 3.145.4 team number, definition, change
        "within its parent team" -> "among its sibling teams"
making the definition read
    "-1 which identifies the initial team, or a positive integer that 
   identifies a team among its sibling teams (5.3.4)

[same place] Append a (normative) note
    "Note 1 to entry: Teams are siblings when they were created by
                      corresponding FORM TEAM statement executions."
        and index "sibling teams" here.
{The Note should only be added if we don't make a separate team for
 sibling teams.}

[36:23] 5.3.4 Program execution, para 2, final sentence
        Replace "Within its parent team,"
        with    "Among its sibling teams,"
making the whole sentence read 
  "Among its sibling teams, each team is identified by its
   team_number; this is the integer value that was specified in the
   FORM TEAM statement."
{This is just waffle, no need to index "sibling teams".}

OPTIONAL:
[131:18-19] In 9.6 Image selectors, p3 second sentence
            Replace "one of the teams that were formed by execution of
                     the FORM TEAM statement for"
            with    "a sibling team of"
making the whole sentence read
  "If a TEAM_NUMBER= specifier appears in an image-selector and the
   current team is not the initial team, the value of scalar-int-expr
   shall be equal to the value of a team number for a sibling team of
   the current team, and the team of the image selector is that team;
   the object shall be an established coarray in an ancestor team of
   the current team, or an associating entity of the CHANGE TEAM
   construct."
{Optional because the existing wording seems to be okay as is.
 This is merely an editorial improvement.}

[204:35] 11.6.9 FORM TEAM statement, p1,
         change "creates new teams"
         to     "creates a set of sibling teams"
         and index "sibling teams" here.
This makes that whole paragraph read:
    "The FORM TEAM statement creates a set of sibling teams whose
     parent team is the current team."

[380:12-13] In 16.9.97 IMAGE_INDEX, p3 TEAM_NUMBER
    Change
        "team whose parent is the same as that of the current team"
    to
        "sibling team of the current team"
    and index "sibling teams" here.
making  the whole argument read:
 "TEAM_NUMBER shall be an integer scalar. It shall identify the
  initial team or a sibling team of the current team."

[401:24-25] 16.9.145 NUM_IMAGES, p3 Arguments, TEAM_NUMBER argument,
    Change
        "team whose parent is the same as that of the current team"
    to
        "sibling team of the current team"
    and index "sibling teams" here.
This makes that whole argument read:
 "TEAM_NUMBER shall be an integer scalar. It shall identify the
  initial team or a sibling team of the current team."

[421:9]16.9.189 TEAM_NUMBER([TEAM]), p5 Result Value,
    Change  "within its parent team" 
    to      "among its sibling teams",
    and index "sibling teams" here.
This makes that whole paragraph read:
  "The result has the value -1 if the specified team is the initial
   team; otherwise, the result value is equal to the positive integer
   that identifies the specified team among its sibling teams."
