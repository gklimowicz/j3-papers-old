Subject:  Edits from corrigendum 1 applied to F2k

These are the edits needed to apply edits from Corrigendum 1 to the 007/R1 
version of F2k.   Each edit from Corrigendum 1 has been broken out into a 
separate chunk with the appropriate action marked by 
	F2K
In many cases the edits have already been applied and the updated text in 
007/R1 is indicated.  In two cases subgroup has a question about whether a 
revised constraint actually includes the corrigendum changes as well.

The header at the start of each group gives F95 page and line numbers and the 
number(s) of the interp that generated the edits.

Subclause 4.3.1.1
Replace text of constraint after R407 with “A boz-literal-constant may appear 
only as a data-stmt-constant in a DATA statement.”
	F2K:    Done in C408, page 37:18-21 (and includes new text to broaden use 
of BOZ)
	NO CHANGE NEEDED

Pages 39 and 40 [39:15-16], [39:23-24], [40:30] 70
Subclause 4.4.1
In the text of the constraint preceding R428, replace: “a constant 
specification expression (7.1.6.2)” with “an initialization expression 
(7.1.6.1)”. 
	F2K:    C430  45:11    Is this the answer?  The constraint looks a 
little broader and appears to allow any expression that doesn't involve 
specification functions (127:7-8).  Is this equivalent to "initialization 
expression"?
	??????????????

In the second constraint after R429, replace “a constant specification 
expression (7.1.6.2)” with “an initialization expression (7.1.6.1)”. 
	F2K:    C433  45:15    Is this the answer?  The constraint looks a 
little broader and appears to allow any expression that doesn't involve 
specification functions (127:7-8).  Is this equivalent to "initialization 
expression"?
	??????????????
