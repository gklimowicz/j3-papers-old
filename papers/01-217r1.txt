Subject: Unresolved issue 318
Date: 5th June 2001

1. Introduction

Issue 318 asks
  "Should a subobject of local variables also be considered a local
variable?
   The glossary entry seems to imply so."

I agree that the glossary entry seems to be at odds with our definition of
local variable.

The easiest fix is to alter the glossary.

A harder fix is to alter the definition and usage.

Edits are supplied for both options, subgroup recommendation is to alter the
definition of "local variable" to conform to our ordinary definition of
"variable".

2. Simple edits to 01-007r1.

[17:4-9] Delete J3 note 318.

[403:41] Before "variable" insert "named".

3. Complicated edits to 01-007r1

[17:1] Before "<<local variable>>" insert "named".
[17:3+] Append to paragraph
        "A subobject of a named local variable is also a local variable."
{Alter local variable definition.}

[17:4-9] Delete J3 note 318.

[106:34] Delete "or a subobject thereof".
{No longer needed.}

[109:8] Insert "named" before "local variable".
{We really do want to restrict ourselves to named local variables.}

[109:11] Delete "or a subobject thereof".
{No longer needed.}
