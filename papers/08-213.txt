Subject:   J3 Fortran interp letter ballot #17 - due 25-Jul-2008
Date: 2008 June 22


Enclosed in the next letter ballot on Fortran interpretations.

The rules by which we operate say:

    o   J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority
        vote marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

    o   Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter
        ballot to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed
        by J3 meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  Not
        voting on three of four consecutive J3 letter ballots is
        grounds to terminate J3 membership.  An interp answer passes
        by a 2/3rds vote;  a no vote must be accompanied by an
        explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's
        vote to yes.

        J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for
        more study even if the answer passes.

15 Fortran interpretations are currently "Passed by J3 meeting" after
J3 meeting #184.  This is the letter ballot phase to go from "Passed
by J3 meeting" to "Passed by J3 letter ballot".

The following Fortran interpretations are being balloted:

QUESTION:

Consider the following program.

PROGRAM questionable
  REAL,TARGET :: x
  CALL s1(f(x))
  CALL s2(f(x))
  CALL s3(f(x))
CONTAINS
  FUNCTION f(a)
    REAL,POINTER :: f
    REAL,TARGET :: a
    f => a
  END FUNCTION
  SUBROUTINE s1(variable)
    variable = 42                  ! statement 1
  END SUBROUTINE
  SUBROUTINE s2(variable)
    INTENT(OUT) variable
    variable = 42                  ! statement 2
  END SUBROUTINE
  SUBROUTINE s3(targ)
    REAL,TARGET :: targ
    REAL,POINTER :: p
    p => targ
    PRINT *,ASSOCIATED(p,x)        ! statement 3
  END SUBROUTINE
END

Is this program standard-conforming, and if so, what value is
printed?

The real question is whether an expression argument that is a pointer
function reference is treated as a variable (data-object) argument
with the variable being the target of the pointer expression.  (Or
whether it is dereferenced as usual in the absence of POINTER dummy
arguments).

Re (statement 1), the question is whether VARIABLE is definable when
argument-associated with "F()".

Re (statement 2), if the previous answer was Yes (VARIABLE is
definable), then presumably it can be made INTENT(OUT).  A random
sample of 4 compilers revealed that they considered it not to be
definable.

Re (statement 3), the question is whether P is pointer-associated
with X, not pointer-associated with X, or processor-dependent.  Of
the same random sample 3 thought it was associated with X, 1 thought
not.

ANSWER:

These answers are in the context of Fortran 2003.

1. The call to s1 is not standard conforming.  5.1.2.7 states
    "If no INTENT attribute is specified for a dummy argument, its use
     is subject to the limitations of the associated actual argument."
   The associated actual argument is the function reference f(x); this
   is an expression, not a variable, and therefore not definable,
   because only variables can be defined (in the sense of being given
   a value, see 2.4.3.1.1 and 2.5.5).

2. The call to s2 is not standard conforming. 12.4.1.2 says:
     "If a nonpointer dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT),
      the actual argument shall be definable."
   Again the actual argument is a function reference, which is not
   definable.

3. The call to s3 is standard conforming and the pointer assignment in
   s3 causes p and x to become associated. This may be deduced from
   12.4.1.2, which says [270:5-0]
     "If the dummy argument has the TARGET attribute, does not have
      the VALUE attribute, and is either a scalar or an assumed-shape
      array, and the corresponding actual argument has the TARGET
      attribute but is not an array section with a vector subscript
      then
        (1) Any pointers associated with the actual argument become
            associated with the corresponding dummy argument on
            invocation of the procedure ..."

NUMBER: F95/0102
TITLE: mask-expr evaluated only once
KEYWORDS: WHERE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Is a mask-expr required to be evaluated in a WHERE such as:

      WHERE ( (/ .TRUE., .TRUE. /) )
        A = A + 1
      ELSE WHERE (MASKF())
        A = MAX
      END WHERE

where an optimizing compiler might notice that the ELSEWHERE
branch will never be executed ?

Page 112, line 38 says of the mask expression in ELSEWHERE statements

"The mask-expression is evaluated only once."

ANSWER:

The above quote is from the Fortran 95 standard.  In Fortran 2003 the
mask expression in an ELSEWHERE is not required to be evaluated, and
this is made clear by the fourth paragraph of 7.4.3.2 (at [147:7])
which, referring to a masked ELSEWHERE statement, states
  "The <mask-expr> is evaluated at most once."

This also applies to the mask expressions of nested WHERE construct
statements; this is made clear by the last sentence of the seventh
paragraph of 7.4.3.2 (at [147:16]) which also states that it is
evaluated "at most once".

However, this does not apply to the mask expression of the outermost
WHERE construct statement, which must be evaluated exactly once; this
is made clear by the last statement of the first paragraph of 7.4.3.2
(at [147:1]) which states that this mask expression is evaluated "only
once".  That does not guarantee invocation of functions in that
expression if they are not required to determine its value.

EDITS:

None.

TITLE: Separators in list-directed output involving UDDTIO
KEYWORDS: list-directed output, separators, UDDTIO
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m
  TYPE t
    INTEGER i
  END TYPE
  INTERFACE WRITE(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedWriteT
  END INTERFACE
CONTAINS
  SUBROUTINE formattedWriteT(dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(t),         INTENT(IN)    :: dtv
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: unit
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: v_list(:)
    INTEGER,          INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

    WRITE(unit, *) dtv%i, 'a'
  END SUBROUTINE
END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  TYPE(t) :: t1 = t(5)
  OPEN(10, FILE='foo.txt', ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL', FORM='FORMATTED', &
       DELIM='NONE')
  WRITE(10, *) 'xyz', t1, 'zyx'
END PROGRAM

10.9.2 of Fortran 2003 states that character sequences produced for
list-directed output are not separated from each other by value
separators when the delimiter mode is NONE.  The implication of this
is obvious when the adjacent effective output list items are both of
character type.  But when user-defined derived-type input/output
is involved, it is much less clear whether a separator should be
included in the output.

In the example given, it is unclear whether the output should be:
 xyz 5 azyx
or:
 xyz 5 a zyx

1. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when one of the character sequences is written by a child
   data transfer statement, and the other is written by a parent data
   transfer statement, where both statements are list-directed?

2. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when the character sequences are written by two different
   child data transfer statements, where both statements are
   list-directed?

3. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   one of the character sequences is written by a child data transfer
   statement, and the other is written by a parent data transfer
   statement, where one of the statements is list-directed and the
   other is format-directed?

4. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   the character sequences are written by two different child data
   transfer statements, where one of the statements is list-directed
   and the other is format-directed?

There is also the further question of whether, in the case of
recursive i/o, this is affected by intervening i/o operations to a
different unit.  For example, in the modified program:

    MODULE m2
     TYPE t
       INTEGER i
     END TYPE

     INTERFACE WRITE(FORMATTED)
       MODULE PROCEDURE formattedWriteT
     END INTERFACE

    CONTAINS

     SUBROUTINE formattedWriteT(dtv,unit,iotype,v_list,iostat,iomsg)
       CLASS(t),         INTENT(IN)    :: dtv
       INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: unit
       CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
       INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: v_list(:)
       INTEGER,          INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
       CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

       CHARACTER(100) temp

       WRITE (temp,'(I0)') dtv%i
       WRITE (unit,*) TRIM(temp)
     END SUBROUTINE

    END MODULE

    PROGRAM foo2
     USE m2
     TYPE(t) :: t1 = t(5)

     OPEN(10, FILE='foo.txt', ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL', &
          FORM='FORMATTED', DELIM='NONE')
     WRITE(10, *) 'xyz', t1, 'zyx'

    END PROGRAM

5. Does the second example write
     xyz 5xyz
   or
     xyz5xyz

   That is, in this case, does the data transfer which is an internal
   file write affect whether 'xyz' and TRIM(temp) are adjacent?

6. Similarly, if the outer list-directed WRITE were to an internal
   file does an intervening external file i/o operation affect whether
   the character sequences are considered adjacent (i.e. the opposite
   way around to the second example)?

ANSWER:

1) No. It is the intent of the standard (10.9.2) that when both the
   parent and child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both are namelist output statements, the
   processor treats the first list item appearing in a child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately
   followed the last list item processed by the parent data
   transfer statement, as long as no other data transfers to that
   unit occurred in between the processing of those two list items.
   Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences are
   considered adjacent.

2) No. It is the intent of the standard (10.9.2) that when two
   different child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both namelist output statements, they write
   to the same unit, and no other data transfers to that unit occur
   in between the two child data transfer statements, the processor
   treats the first list item appearing in the second child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately followed
   the last list item processed by the first child data transfer
   statement.  Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences
   are considered adjacent.

3) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  In section 10.9.2, the
   phrase "adjacent undelimited character sequences" refers to
   character sequences produced by list-directed output.  When one of
   the sequences is written by a child or parent output statement
   that is not list-directed, the exception described in the first
   paragraph of 10.9.2 does not apply. The other rules for inserting
   optional blanks around values in list-directed output allow the
   processor to insert optional leading and trailing blanks around a
   list item.  The standard does not specify when optional blanks are
   written; therefore, when two adjacent list items (the values
   thereof) are written to an output record, and only one of them was
   written by list-directed input/output, the standard does not
   specify whether or not any optional blanks appear between those
   values in the output record.

4) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  See answer 3.

5) The result should be "xyz5xyz", that is, the recursive i/o to the
   internal file does not affect whether the character sequences being
   written by the outer data transfer statement are considered
   adjacent.

6) No, if an outer data transfer is to an internal file, then a
   recursive i/o operation to a different internal file or an external
   file does not affect whether the character sequences are considered
   adjacent.

NOTE TO J3:

In Fortran 2008, recursive i/o operations to a different external unit
are allowed and these also ought not to affect whether the character
sequences written by the outer data transfer statement are considered
to be adjacent.  The edit to F2003 below will produce that result when
applied to the (draft) F2008.

EDITS:

[241:5] In Section 10.9.2, add the following to the end of the
        first paragraph:
  "Two undelimited character sequences are considered adjacent when
   both were written using list-directed input/output, no intervening
   data transfer or input/output file positioning operations on that
   unit occurred, and both were written either by a single data
   transfer statement, or during the execution of a parent data
   transfer statement along with its child data transfer statements."

NUMBER: F03/0071
TITLE: Subroutine/function ambiguity in generics
KEYWORDS: subroutine, generic, implicit
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

 Q1. Is the following generic allowed?

     interface q
       subroutine qr(f)
         implicit real(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
       subroutine qc(f)
         implicit complex(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
     end interface q

     The uncertainly arises because it is not established
     whether F is a subroutine or a function. If either F
     were a subroutine, then it would be clear that the
     generic was disallowed. One might be able to use this
     to deduce that both Fs must be functions. This seems
     like an obscure deduction to demand of the compiler.

 Q2. Consider the following "obviously" allowed generic

     module m
       interface q
         subroutine qr(f)
           real, external :: f
         end subroutine
         subroutine qc(f)
           complex, external :: f
         end subroutine
       end interface q
     end module m

     Is the following main program valid?

     program main
       use m
       external ff
       call q(ff)
     end

     Again, the problem is that it is unclear whether or not
     ff is a function or subroutine. If it is a subroutine,
     then the call is ambiguous. One might thus deduce that
     ff must be a function, and therefore of type real,
     but this seems like an obscure deduction to demand of
     the compiler.

ANSWER:

1. The program fragment is not conforming.  A generic interface is
   required to be nonambiguous.  This is a similar situation to the
   declaration of an external procedure in a module, where a procedure
   that is a function is required to have its type and type parameters
   explicitly declared.  An edit is provided to require this for
   specific procedures in a generic interface.

2. The main program is conforming.  As remarked, at the call site the
   procedure is known to be either a subroutine or a function.  Since
   the generic does not allow a subroutine as an argument, it must
   therefore be a function.  Implicit typing means that ff is real so
   qr is called.  (The generic cannot have a specific that
   accepts a subroutine as an argument, as that would violate the
   requirements in 16.2.3.)

EDITS:

[261:3] In 12.3.2.1 Interface block,
  immediately after "A generic interface is always explicit.",
  append new sentence to paragraph
    "If a specific procedure in a generic interface has a function
     dummy argument, that argument shall have its type and type
     parameters explicitly declared in the specific interface."
{I.e. if you just say EXTERNAL dummy, you must mean a subroutine.}

   interface
      subroutine CSub() bind(C,name="AnExternalCProcedure")
      end subroutine
   end interface
end module

ANSWER:

No, the fragment is not conforming. The name of an external procedure is
a global entity and is required to be unique. That is, the external C
procedure AnExternalCProcedure, must be given a unique Fortran name
inside a Fortran program.

EDITS:

None.

TITLE: LBOUND of array structure component
KEYWORDS: LBOUND, lower bounds, bounds, structure component, array

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Given the declarations

  TYPE t
    REAL x
    REAL y(-5:5)
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t) z(10:20)

What is the result of the following LBOUND references:
  LBOUND(z(10)%y)
  LBOUND(z%x)

The confusion arises because the existing definition of LBOUND uses
the undefined term "array structure component" in determining whether
to return the lower bound in the <array-spec> or 1.  It seems clear
that Z(10)%Y must be an array structure component (so the answer ought
to be -5) but it is not clear whether Z%X is one and therefore whether
the result of that LBOUND ought to be 1 or 10.

ANSWER:

Yes, the result of the first LBOUND is indeed -5.
The result of the second LBOUND is 1.
Clarifying edits are provided.

The description of the intrinsic function UBOUND suffers from the same
flaw, and the edits provided fix that function as well.

EDITS:

To avoid the undefined term, or any long phrase, the edit changes the
definition of "whole array" to include the case of a whole array
component of a structure.

[107:2-3] Replace the existing definition which is
  "A whole array is a named array, which may be either a named
  constant (5.1.2.10, 5.2.9) or a variable; no subscript list is
  appended to the name."
with
  "A <<whole array>> is a named array or a structure component whose
   final <part-ref> is an array component name; no subscript list is
  appended."
{Make "whole array" include the whole array component case.}

[107:7-8] Replace "whole array name" with "whole array designator",
          twice.

[326:8] After "a whole array" delete "or array structure component".
{No longer need kludgy wording in LBOUND.}

[358:6-7] After "a whole array" delete "or array structure component".
{No longer need kludgy wording in UBOUND.}

[436:36] After "named array" insert
  "or array component of a structure, with no subscript list."
{Fix the glossary.}

QUESTION:

Does the Fortran 2003 standard allow the output field produced by an F
edit descriptor with a field width w whose value is zero for a real
value whose magnitude is less than one to include an optional leading
zero?

For example, is the PRINT statement

          PRINT '(F0.2)', 0.01

allowed to write "0.01"?

No.  This is clear from Section 10.6.1 of the Fortran 2003 standard,

TITLE: VALUE in place of INTENT for pure procedure dummy arguments
KEYWORDS: VALUE, INTENT, PURE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

C1266 requires all nonpointer dummy arguments of a pure function to be
data objects that have INTENT(IN).  C1267 requires all dummy arguments
of a pure subroutine to have specified intents.

Was it intended that VALUE not be allowed in place of INTENT(IN), that
is, was it intended that if a dummy argument of a pure procedure has
the VALUE attribute, it is nonetheless also required to have the
INTENT(IN) attribute explicitly specified?

ANSWER:

The possible extension of the VALUE attribute to allow omission of the
INTENT(IN) attribute in the specific case of pure procedures was not
considered during the development of Fortran 2003.  However, the
standard is consistent and not in error, and so this restriction
should remain.

None.

QUESTION:

Does the following subprogram fragment conflict with the 2003 Fortran
standard?  If so, was the conflict intended?

  entry A ( X )
    interface
      subroutine X ( A )
        abstract interface
          subroutine I ( ... )
          ...
          end subroutine I
        end interface
        procedure (I) A
      end subroutine X
    end interface
  ...

It seems that constraint C1255 in subclause 12.5.2.4 [283:10-12]
prohibits the entry name A to appear in the PROCEDURE statement in
the interface body.  There shouldn't be a problem, however, since
the PROCEDURE statement is in a different scoping unit.

ANSWER:

No, this program fragment conforms to the 2003 Fortran standard.

EDITS:

None

NOTE:

C1255 is pointless because Clause 16 applies.  It could
fruitfully be removed from a future revision of the Fortran standard.

KEYWORDS: allocate, source, define

STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Was it intended that an allocate with a source= clause define
subcomponents?

Bullet 11 on 422 says "Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement
...causes the subcomponent to become undefined."

ANSWER:

An Allocate with a SOURCE= specifier was intended to define
subcomponents.

In fact, none of the lists in clause 16 account for a SOURCE=
specifier.  Edits are supplied to clarify this.

EDITS:

[113:21]  At the end of the last sentence in 6.3.1.1 insert
  "unless the SOURCE= specifier appears and the corresponding
   component of the <source-expr> is allocated".

  ", except by an ALLOCATE statement with a SOURCE= specifier,"

  "(19a) Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement with a SOURCE=
         specifier causes a subobject of the allocated object to

[422:41-42] 16.5.6, list item (11), replace list item with
  "Successful allocation of an ALLOCATE statement with no SOURCE=

NUMBER: F03/0112
TITLE: attributes allowed for dummy arguments in defined assignments
KEYWORDS: defined assignment, dummy argument, attributes
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

DISCUSSION:

It seems the standard is quite loose in allowing various attributes
declared for the dummy arguments used in a defined assignment
(7.4.1.4).  In particular, attributes such as POINTER and ALLOCATABLE
can be declared for dummy arguments in the defined assignment.
However the interpretations on their declarations need to be
clarified.

Consider the follow subroutines (assuming a derived type DT already
defined)

    1. POINTER/ALLOCATABLE on the second dummy argument

    interface ASSIGNMENT (=)
    subroutine defAssgn1 (dt1, dt2)
        type(DT), intent(out) :: dt1
        type(DT), POINTER, intent(in) :: dt2
    end subroutine
    end interface

    In 12.3.2.1.2 [263:10-12], the standard says the following
    "A defined assignment is treated as a reference to the subroutine,
     with the left-hand side as the first argument and the right-hand
     side enclosed in parentheses as the second argument."

    This statement seems to prohibit the use of subroutine defAssgn1
    for defined assignment since a pointer enclosed in parentheses
    refers to its associated target not the pointer itself, as
    indicated by rules in 7.1.4.1 [123:39-124:3].

    2. POINTER/ALLOCATABLE on the first dummy argument

    interface ASSIGNMENT (=)
    subroutine defAssgn2 (dt1, dt2)
        type(DT), POINTER, intent(out) :: dt1
        type(DT), intent(in) :: dt2
    end subroutine
    end interface

    There are no rules in the standard disallow this declaration.
    However the use of POINTER/ALLOCATABLE attributes on the first
    dummy argument is very doubtful.  Since POINTER/ALLOCATABLE
    attributes don't disambiguate generic declarations(16.2.3), their
    use will prevent the normal declarations of defined assignments,
    wherein dt1 is declared without POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attribute.

QUESTIONS:

1.  Are POINTER and ALLOCATABLE attributes allowed for the second
    dummy argument in defined assignment?

2.  Are POINTER and ALLOCATABLE attributes allowed for the first
    dummy argument in defined assignment?

ANSWER:

Yes to both questions. The standard places very few restrictions on
the arguments to defined assignment subroutines:  [263:6...]

  Each of these subroutines shall have exactly two dummy arguments.
  Each argument shall be nonoptional.  The first argument shall have
  INTENT (OUT) or INTENT (INOUT) and the second argument shall have
  INTENT (IN). ...

Preventing the first argument from having the POINTER
attribute violates F90.  Such a restriction for the second argument
has no effect since the right argument is treated as an expression
enclosed in parentheses which would have neither attribute but it
does no harm.  An edit is provided.

EDITS:

In section 12.3.2.1.2 of 04-007, second paragraph, at the end of the
third sentence [263:8], after "INTENT (IN)", insert "and shall not
have the ALLOCATABLE attribute".

NUMBER: F03/0117
TITLE: STOP executed via function in input/output list
KEYWORDS: STOP
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Interpretation F90/000209 considered the question
    Section 9.7.  May a function referenced in an I/O statement
    execute a STOP or PAUSE statement?  If STOP statements are
    permitted, what is the state of the file at the end of
    execution?

The answer (w.r.t. STOP), included in F95 corrigendum 2, replied
    No, a STOP statement may not be executed in this situation.
    Executing a STOP statement causes normal termination of
    execution, which closes all files (9.3.5), and this is equivalent
    to executing a CLOSE statement, which is prohibited by 9.7.  A
    clarifying edit is supplied.

This answer was reasonable for Fortran 90/95, but the reasoning is
defective when applied to Fortran 2003.  Fortran 2003 allows execution
of a CLOSE statement for any external file during the execution of an
internal i/o statement (so-called "recursive i/o").  It seems that
this consideration was overlooked for Fortran 2003.

However, on further consideration of the reasoning behind this answer,
it seems unhelpful to rule out STOP, which is often used for user
signalling of error conditions, during i/o operations.  For one thing,
if the data transfer statement being executed is READ, the question
about file state has a very straightforward answer.  It might also be
considered unhelpful in the WRITE case for STOP to cause the user's
entire file system to be potentially reformatted instead of just
making the contents of the relevant file undefined.

Furthermore, the user who wants to signal an error can cause error
termination via one of the "approved" methods such as DEALLOCATE of an
unallocated array.  It seems less than unhelpful to force the user to
use such a circumlocution simply for standards conformance, and the
question about file state can equally be asked of this situation.

Q1. Is execution of a STOP statement during internal i/o allowed?

Q2. Is execution of a STOP statement during a READ statement allowed?

Q3. Is execution of a STOP statement during a WRITE statement allowed?

Q4. What is the effect on the file state of executing the following
    code fragment during a WRITE statement to an external file:

      REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: array(:)
      DEALLOCATE(array)

    (And if the answer to Q3 is yes, does a STOP statement have the
    same effect.)

ANSWER:

The answer to the first three questions is yes, this should have been
allowed.  An edit is provided to correct the standard.

The answer to Q4 is that the effects on the file currently being
written by that WRITE statement are not standardised.  (This was, in
fact, the situation before the adoption of the previous interp
answer.)  A clarifying edit is provided to indicate that the contents
of the file become undefined.

EDITS:

[195:23+]
In 9.5.3 "Execution of a data transfer input/output statement",
immediately before Note 9.38 insert a new paragraph
  "If execution of the program is terminated during execution of a
   WRITE or PRINT statement, the contents of the file become
   undefined."

Delete [219:30] the last paragraph of 9.11 which currently reads
  "A STOP statement shall not be executed during execution of an
   input/output statement."
