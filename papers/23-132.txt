Edits to the N2209
------------------

In 15.5.2.14 Restrictions on entities associated with dummy arguments,
para 1, item (3) (e), change "ultimate component" to "potential subobject 
component" so that the item becomes
"Action that affects the value of the entity or any subobject of it shall 
be taken only through the dummy argument unless ..., or the dummy 
argument has a coarray potential subobject component and the action is a 
coindexed definition of the corresponding coarray by a different image." 

In 15.5.2.14 Restrictions on entities associated with dummy arguments,
para 1, item (4) (e), change "ultimate component" to "potential subobject 
component" so that the item becomes
"If the value of the entity or any subobject of it is affected through 
the dummy argument, then at any time during the invocation and execution 
of the procedure, either before or after the definition, it shall be 
referenced only through that dummy argument unless ..., or
the dummy argument has a coarray potential subobject component and the 
reference is a coindexed reference of the corresponding coarray by a 
different image."

In 15.5.2.14 Restrictions on entities associated with dummy arguments,
final note (NOTE 5), first sentence, change "ultimate component" to 
"potential subobject component" so that the sentence becomes
"The exceptions to the aliasing restrictions for dummy arguments that 
are coarrays or have coarray potential subobject components enable 
cross-image access while the procedure is executing."

In 16.9.54 CO_BROADCAST, argument A,  final sentence change "ultimate 
component" to "potential subobject component" twice so that the sentence 
becomes
"If no error condition occurs, A becomes defined, as if by intrinsic 
assignment, on all images in the current team with the value of A on 
image SOURCE_IMAGE, including (re)allocation of any allocatable potential 
subobject component, and setting the dynamic type of any polymorphic 
allocatable potential subobject component."
