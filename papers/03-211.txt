                           Revision of N1534

                        Aleksandar Donev 1st draft

Donev: Following comments from the editor on recently passed edits, and as
the author of J3/03-113r3 (which introduced abstract types and deferred
bindings), I include some agreed-upon edits. Some of these stem from
discussions with Bill Long:

These edits are relative to 03-007:

[56:13] Replace "an abstract type definition" with "the definition of an
abstract type"

[427:7] Replace reference to 4.5.7 with reference to 4.5.6

[430:9] Delete the second reference to (4.5.4)

[445:36] Add ", DEFERRED" and indent it properly (3 characters
in from "CONTAINS")

PROCEDURE(RENDER_X),  PASS(OBJECT),   DEFERRED :: RENDER

[51:17] Add a reference to (4.5.6) at the end of the sentence.

In Note 9.49 [205:8+] and Note 9.50 [206], the dtv-type-spec
should use CLASS, not TYPE. Replace
    TYPE(...), INTENT(IN) :: dtv
with
    CLASS(...),INTENT(IN) :: dtv

[206] Note 9.50: The pwf subroutine never sets a value for iostat.
Possible fix: Change end of subroutine to:

   WRITE (unit, '(i9 /)', IOSTAT = iostat) dtv%value
   IF(iostat/=0) RETURN
   IF(ASSOCIATED(dtv%next_node)) WRITE(unit,'(dt)', IOSTAT=iostat) dtv%next_node

(Editor should make this look pretty if the line gets too long).
