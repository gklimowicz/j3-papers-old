----------

Note 7.1 suggests that some forms of memory reference to a failed
image might be successful. This contradicts our definition of a failed
image.  While it might be physically possible, due to the memory for
an atomic operation being cached in a hardware NIC, the note itself is
confusing to the point of being unhelpful.  It is better to delete the
note.
