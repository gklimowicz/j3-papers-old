Subject: Improving IMPORT                             J3/02-187r1
From: Kurt W. Hirchert                  (Meeting 161) 16 May 2002

Of the proposed improvements suggested in 02-187, only one has had
any significant positive response, that of allowing IMPORT without
a list to behave similarly to SAVE without a list and provide
access to everything.  The edits below make that change.  Note
that one of the edits fixes a bug in the text and should be approved
even if the rest of the edits are not.

257:9   Place an additional set of square brackets around
	"[::] <import-name-list>".
257:37-38   Replace "appear ... body." with "not appear in any of
	the contexts described in 16.4.1.3 that cause the host entity
	of that name to be inaccessible."  [This is the bug fix.]
257:38+   New paragraph:
	Within an interface body, if an IMPORT statement with no
	<import-name-list> appears, each host entity not named in an
	IMPORT statement also is made accessible by host association
	if its name does not appear in any of the contexts described
	in 16.4.1.3 that cause the host entity of that name to be
	inaccessible.
