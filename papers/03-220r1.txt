                       Response to N1533 (NEW_LINE)

                          Michael Ingrassia 

Subgroup response to Dan Nagle's list of difficulties with NEW_LINE
in paper N1533.  Items not recommended by WG5 have been deleted from this paper.

>as newline,

Subgroup: There should be no requirement that the default character set has control characters.

[23:6] Delete '("newline", for example)'

       There might not be such a character.  It is not a particularly
       illuminating example.

>Lastly, we don't say how we want NEW_LINE to work with any default,
>non-ASCII, non-ISO_10646 character types ('processor-dependent' isn't
>much of a hint).

Subgroup: Assuming newline exists for default characters, this is specified (e.g. See [235:1-7]).  It should return a blank if no newline exists (edits following).

[341:15] "." -> "or a blank if no newline is available"

[341:21] "," -> "and ACHAR(10) character is representable in the default
character set,"

Subgroup: Finally, move a paragraph which is in the wrong place (this paragraph is not talking about "Other characters"). 

[24:15-20] Move to [23:20+].

Additional Section 9 edits.
182:7  Replace "which" with "that".

182:17+3, in note  Replace "may" with "might".

219:27   Replace "conditions" with "condition"
220:1    Replace "conditions" with "condition"
