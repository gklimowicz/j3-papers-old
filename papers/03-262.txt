Subject: Unlimited polymorphics as derived type components

C438 and C439 (both below) appear to prohibit unlimited polymorphics from
being data components of a derived type.

C438 (R440) If the POINTER attribute is not specified for a component, the
<declaration-type-spec> in the <component-def-stmt> shall specify an
intrinsic type or a previously defined derived type.

C439 (R440) If the POINTER attribute is specified for a component, the
<declaration-type-spec> in the <component-def-stmt> shall specify an
intrinsic type or any accessible derived type including the type being
defined.

Unlimited polymorphics would obviously violate these constraints.  I can't
see a good reason for unlimited polymorphics to be prohibited as components
of a derived type.


Proposed edits to the Fortran 2003 FCD:
---------------------------------------
[50:19] After "<component-def-stmt>", insert "shall be CLASS(*) or".

[50:21] After "<component-def-stmt>", insert "shall be CLASS(*) or".
