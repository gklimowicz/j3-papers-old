Subject:   Wart removal proposal -- pointer arguments to SAME_TYPE_AS
From:      Van Snyder & Steve Lionel
Date: 2015 August 05
Reference: 15-007r1, 15-111r1

1. Introduction
===============

The dynamic type of a nonpolymorphic pointer is always well defined.
Therefore the requirement that a pointer argument to SAME_TYPE_AS shall
not have undefined association status is not necessary for
nonpolymorphic arguments.

The following works:

  type(t), pointer :: P
  class(t), intent(in) :: A
  nullify ( p )
  if ( same_type_as ( A, P ) ) ...

The following does not work (for no good reason):

  type(t), pointer :: P
  class(t), intent(in) :: A
! nullify ( p )
  if ( same_type_as ( A, P ) ) ...

The same observation and argument apply to EXTENDS_TYPE_OF.

2. Requirements
===============

Allow a nonpolymorphic argument to EXTENDS_TYPE_OF or SAME_TYPE_AS to
have undefined pointer association status.

3. Syntax
=========

No change to existing syntax.

4. Edits
========

[Introduction, under "Intrinsic Functions"] Insert list item

"-- Nonpolymorphic pointer arguments to EXTENDS_TYPE_OF or SAME_TYPE_AS
    are not required to have defined pointer association status."

[358:25,27 13.8.70p3] Insert "polymorphic" before "pointer" twice.

[397:25,27 13.8.156p3] Insert "polymorphic" before "pointer" twice.
