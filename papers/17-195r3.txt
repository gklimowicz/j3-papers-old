Subject: Comment DE 031 - coarrays inside CHANGE TEAM
Date: 2017 October 18
References: N2137, N2141

Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DE 031 requests adding a NOTE to the end of section 11.1.5 that explains
how coarrays established in an ancestor team are handled inside the
block of a CHANGE TEAM construct. This paper supplies the edit needed to
implement that NOTE, with a modification suggested by John Reid.

Edit to N2137:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[188:31+] At the end of section 11.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM
construct, after NOTE 11.6 (end of page 188), add a new Note:

"NOTE 11.6+

A coarray that is established when a CHANGE TEAM statement is executed
retains its corank and cobounds inside the block.  If it is desired to
perform remote accesses based on corank or cobounds different from
those of the original coarray, an associating coarray can be used.
Appendix C.6.7 supplies an illustration of this.  In an image
selector, the cobounds and cosubscripts are used to compute an image
index. That image index identifies the image with that index within
the team specified by the image selector. A team other than the
current team can be specified using a TEAM= or TEAM_NUMBER= specifier
in the image selector."

{Note to Editor: C.6.7 is "Accessing coarrays in sibling teams"
starting on page 561.}
