NUMBER: F08/0134
TITLE: <stat-variable> in an image control statement
KEYWORDS: stat=, image control statement
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Was it intended to allow <stat-variable> or <errmsg-variable> in an
image control statement to be coindexed? For example, was it intended
that this statement
    SYNC IMAGES(1, stat = is[2])
be allowed? It seems undesirable to involve image 2 when synchronizing
the executing image with image 1.

ANSWER:

No, it was not intended to allow the <stat-variable> or
<errmsg-variable> in an image image control statement to be coindexed.

An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

EDIT:

[190:5+] Add constraint
"C851a (R859) A <stat-variable> or <errmsg-variable> in a <sync-stat>
shall not be a coindexed object.
