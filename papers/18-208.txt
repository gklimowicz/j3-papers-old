1. Introduction

Page 584, C.10.3,
"Abstract interfaces and procedure pointer components (15.4, 7.5)"

The dummy argument "callback" is not declared in
the subroutine "forward_invoke".

The following statement should be added in the
specification-part of the subroutine:
TYPE(callback_record),POINTER :: callback

2. Response

JP070 accepted as is.

3. Edit to N2146

Page 584, C.10.3,
"Abstract interfaces and procedure pointer components (15.4, 7.5)"

After "SUBROUTINE forward_invoke(callback)"
insert the line "TYPE(callback_record),POINTER :: callback".
