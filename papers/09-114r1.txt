Discussion

The word "name" is used sometimes in the text for namelist in the
generalized sense of name or designator. This is misleading and
should be corrected.

The requirements that allocatable components of a namelist object be
allocated and pointer components have targets are not given.

Some of the text in 10.11.3.1-10.11.3.3 really belongs in 10.11.2 or
in a different subclause within 10.11.3.1-10.11.3.3 and some needs
rewording or is redundant.

It was not intended to allow coindexed objects to appear in
namelists. Our belief is that a very careful reading of the present
text implies this, but we feel that it is desirable to make this
clear.

Edits are provided to correct these problems.

Edits to 09-007

[225:17-18] In 9.6.4.6 Namelist formatting, para. 1, sentence 1,
      change "allocated and every" to "allocated and all its
      allocatable subobjects shall be allocated. Every" and change
      "target" to "target and all its pointer subobjects shall be
      associated with a target".

[268:16] In 10.11.1 General, replace "NAME=value" by "name-value"

[268:24] In 10.11.2 Name-value subsequences, replace para 2 by
      "The designator shall be the name of an object of the
      <namelist-group> (5.6) or shall designate a subobject of
      such an object. It shall not contain a vector subscript or an
      <image-selector> and shall not designate a zero-sized array,
      a zero-sized array section, or a zero-length character string.
      Subscripts, strides, and substring range expressions shall be
      optionally signed integer literal constants with no kind type
      parameters specified. If a section subscript list appears,
      the number of section subscripts shall be equal to the rank of
      the object.  Each designator may be preceded and followed
      by one or more optional blanks but shall not contain embedded
      blanks."

[269:1-3] In 10.11.3.1 Overall syntax, replace para 2 by
      "The order of the name-value subsequences in the input records
      need not match the order of the names in the <namelist-group>.
      The input records need not contain all the names in the
      <namelist-group>. They may specify a part of an object more than
      once.
      [This is a reworded version of the first two sentences of
      10.11.3.3, para 2. The points made in the previous version
      of this para are now in 10.11.2.]

[269:5-18] Delete subclause 10.11.3.2 Namelist group object names
      [The points are now made in other subclauses.]

[269:19] 10.11.3.3 Namelist group object list items. Change title to
       "Namelist input processing".

[269:20-21] In 10.11.3.3 Namelist group object list items, insert at
       the end of para 1:
       "The definition status of a subobject of an object in the
       <namelist-group> that does not occur in the input records
       remains unchanged.

[269:22] In 10.11.3.3 Namelist group object list items, at the start
       of para 2, change "name" to "designator".

[269:28+] In 10.11.3.3 Namelist group object list items, at the start
       of NOTE 10.35, change the first occurence of "name" to
       "designator".

[272:3-4] In 10.11.4.1 Form of namelist output, replace the first two
       sentences by
       "The form of the output produced shall be suitable for input.
       The names in the output are in upper case."
       [I think this is what is meant. The exceptional cases were
       spelt out in 10.10.2.1 of F2003, which corresponds to the
       present 10.11.4.2].
