----------

In his recent ballot (see N2045) Malcolm Cohen made suggestions for
the improvement of clause 5.7.

Edits to N2040:
---------------

[13:14] Change "No further" to "Neither normal nor error termination
is initiated, but no further".

[13:17] Add "It is recommended that the stop code is made available by
formatted output on the unit identified by the named constant
ERROR_UNIT defined in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."

[37:6] At the end of the sentence append 'and "defined in the
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV" at the end of paragraph 3 changed to
"(13.8.2.8)"'.
