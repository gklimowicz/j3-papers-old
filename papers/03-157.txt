Here are some minor edits that I would like to suggest

161:13+. Copy 403:9-12 to here:

   If the selector is allocatable, it shall be allocated; the associate
   name is associated with the data object and does not have the
   ALLOCATABLE attribute.

   If the selector has the POINTER attribute, it shall be associated;
   the associate name is associated with the target of the pointer and
   does not have the POINTER attribute.

[These are important properties of the ASSOCIATE construct that need to
be mentioned here. Anyway, without the change, 161:14 is incorrect.]

268:7. Change '15.1' to '15.1.1'.

377:0+6. After 'LOGICAL' add '::'.

405:36. Change '15.1' to '15.1.1'.
