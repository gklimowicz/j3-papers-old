Ballot Comment
--------------

In the DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, 
GB035 says that the first sentence of 
13.8.4 "SS, SP, and S editing" paragraph 3 is misleading because 
the sign-edit mode also affects list-directed and namelist editing.  
GB035 further recommends that the sentence listing the format
descriptors affected by SS, SP and S editing be removed.

JoR notes that list-directed and namelist editing are described
in terms of the format descriptors listed here.  For example, in
section "13.10.3 List-directed input" paragraph 3 describes integer
input in terms of I and paragraph 4 describes real input in terms
of F editing.  For output, section "13.10.4 List-directed output" 
paragraph 4 describes integer output in terms of I editing, and 
paragraph 5 describes real output in terms of either F or E editing, 
depending on the magnitude of the number.  There are similar sections
for namelist (sections 13.11.3.3 and 13.11.4) where the input and
output are described in terms of I or F editing.

For this reason, JoR disagrees that this edit is necessary.

GB035 also requests that the sentence describing that sign-edit
descriptors have no effect on input also include the phrase 
"are permitted but".

JoR disagrees with this change because it would be inconsistent 
with other edit descriptors, where we simply state that they have no 
effect on either input or output (such as P editing), and because
adding the phrase is a matter of style not correctness.

GB037 is similar to GB035.  It says that the second sentence of
13.8.8 "DC and DP editing" paragraph 2 is misleading because 
the decimal edit mode also affects list-directed and namelist editing.
It also recommends that this second sentence (listing the format
descriptors affected by DC and DP) be removed.

JoR disagrees that this edit is necessary for the same reasons listed
above.

However, if the lists of edit descriptors are to remain, they need to
include the new EX edit descriptor.

EDITS

[282] "13.8.4 SS, SP, and S editing" p3: In the final sentence of this 
paragraph add "EX, " after the "EN, ES, " making the 
entire sentence read:
"The SS, SP, and S edit descriptors affect only I, F, E, EN, ES, EX, 
 D, and G editing during the execution of an output statement. " 

[283] "13.8.8 DC and DP editing" p2: In the final sentence of this
paragraph add "EX, " after the "EN, ES, " making the entire sentence
read:

"The decimal edit mode affects only D, E, EN, ES, EX, F, and G editing."
