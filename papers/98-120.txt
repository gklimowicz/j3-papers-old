Subject:  Additional Edits for M.5: Extend Max and Min
          Intrinsics to Character Type

References: X3J3/96-007r1, X3J3/96-131r1, J3/97-156r1, J3/97-207, J3/249r1

PROPOSAL:

Extend the intrinsic functions Max, Min, MaxLoc, MinLoc, MaxVal, and MinVal to accept arguments of character data type. 

PROPOSED ADDITIONAL EDITS:

Note: Edits that were approved through Meeting 143 (November 1997) are shown in document J3/98-007 (13 January, 1998). Page and line references below are to that document.

Max: 

[262: 33] Add sentence: If the arguments are of character type, none of them shall be an optional dummy argument.

Min: 

[265: 31] Add sentence: If the arguments are of character type, none of them shall be an optional dummy argument.

BACKGROUND:
Specification and Syntax were approved at Meeting 138 (August 1996) - see X3J3/96-131r1. Edits were approved at Meeting 141 (May 1997). Additional edits were approved at Meeting 143 (November 1997). The edits in this paper are intended to prohibit references to MAX and MIN with actual arguments that are optional.dummy arguments in the referencing scope, as in the following example:

       subroutine Sub( X, Y, Z )
         character(len = 1), intent(in) :: X, Y
         character((len = 10), intent(in), optional :: Z
     ! start subroutine Sub
         print *, max( X, Y, Z )
         print *, len( max( X, Y, Z ) )
         return
       end subroutine Sub
