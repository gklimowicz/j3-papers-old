Beginning membership report                       L. Menard

There are 15 voting members in good standing.
There are two prospective voting members: AMD and 
   Lawrence Livermore National Labs.
Even though we saw Rich Bleikamp at the last meeting
his attendance at this meeting is his Observation meeting
and he becomes a voting member at the beginning of the next meeting.

Even though we've seen Craig Rasmussen for many years,
because he is the representative for a new organization,
he needs to have an Observation meeting before LLNL
can become a voting member.

At the last meeting, I reported that Lawrence Berkeley National Labs
was in jeopardy due to attendance, but they are still listed as Voting
at the INCITS website.  Because Brian is in attendance at this meeting,
all is well.

available to the general public).  Thus, the paper assignments
will not be listed in the meeting, nor in these minutes.

2.2 Tutorials
   Zack lead a discussion on 20-107, default values on optional args.
   Questions that came from the discussion:
     Does PRESENT() return true if not present but default value is used?

     What to do with an optional array dummy argument?
     What if the dummy has TARGET attribute?
   There was a LIVELY discussion with several other concerns, and the
   paper was sent back for rework.

3.2 Tutorials (if needed)
   A discussion of 20-108 "Namespace for Modules" was led by Ondrej.
In summary, it allows referencing module variable as modname%varname.
Discussion: Malcolm says not compelling, can be done with rename.
Van says it can be done with use, only.  Tom likes the clarity of
expressing where a variable came from. Vipul noted that the tutorial
demonstrated a need for namespace management, and collaboration is
necessary for evolution of the language.

Comments:
   Dan noted that the committee is growing.
   There are a number of roles people can play.
   Van has been our default host when person who would be next was
   not there, and has been the chief negotiator with the hotel. If
   someone would like to volunteer for permanent long term host, the
   role gets you a free lunch with Valerie each meeting.

   Ondrej, Zach, Vipul all will try to scribe technical discussion in a
   factual manner to be published in j3-fortran github.

   Ondrej: Thank you all for helping gather information on 202y proposals.
   The greater Fortran community appreciates greater visibility inside
   the committee activities.
   
   Malcolm: Potential interp in interp folder regarding private data in
   public namelist.
   Jon, Rich, and Steve should look and advise Malcolm how to proceed.
