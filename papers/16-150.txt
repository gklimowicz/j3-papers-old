+++ Issue #1 +++

This is a proposed edit in clause 9.

[210:9-10] 9.5.1 says that an external unit identified
by the same integer value is the same unit throughout the program.

Surely, the intention is per image, not per program.

[210:10] change "program" to "image"

{state correct scope of external unit values}

+++ Issue #2 +++

At [221:31] in 9.6.2.9, ID= is prohibited
in child data transfer statements.

The discussion in [220:19-29] 9.6.2.5 gives the processor
permission to execute either synchronously or asynchronously.

Furthermore, at [226:1-3] 9.6.4.1 (after the numbered list)
"data transfers may occur during execution of the statement,
during execution of the wait statement, or anywhere in between"

Thus, any operation where a wait occurs first (any positioning
or flush will do) or a WAIT statement are symmetric
to the data transfer statement as far as asynchronous-ness goes.

If ID= is forbidden in a child transfer statement,
should waits be forbidden as well?
