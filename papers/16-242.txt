Subject: CHANGE/END TEAM syncs

Discussion
----------

Synchronization of images as part of executing a CHANGE TEAM or END
TEAM statement is among the images of the team current inside the
CHANGE TEAM construct.  Some might expect that the synchronization is
among the images of the team that is current in the team just outside
the construct, which could be a useful capability in some cases. A
Note is supplied to clarify what happens and illustrate how to
accomplish the more global sync.

----------------

[186:33-] At the end of 11.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct,
following the existing Note 11.5, insert a new Note:

"Note 11.5a

Execution of a CHANGE TEAM statement includes a synchronization of the
executing image with the other images that have the same value of
TEAM_NUMBER() for the team specified in the CHANGE TEAM
statement. Synchronization of these same images occurs when the
corresponding END TEAM statement is executed.  If the program
semantics require that these synchronizations involve all of the
images in the team that is current when CHANGE TEAM begins execution,
then a SYNC ALL statement should be inserted just before the CHANGE
TEAM statement.  If similar semantics are needed following the END
TEAM statement, a SYNC ALL statement should immediately follow the END
TEAM statement."
