Reference: 18-119:2.5.2

In addition to the rationale for Views given in subclause 2.5.2 of
18-119, a slight modification would allow to address the real complex
problem:

  complex, ... :: A(:,...)
  real, view(A) :: B(2*size(a,1):,:,:,...) ! 18-119 : 2.4.2.3, 04-198
or
  real, view(A) :: B(2*size(a,1),ubound(a,2),ubound(a,3),...)

The constraint for a real view of a complex object would require the
same kind type parameter.  For a complex view of a real object, in
addition, there would be a constraint that the real object be an array,
and a runtime requirement that the extent in its first dimension is
even.
