1. Introduction
===============

Discussion of various topics regarding asynchronous transfers
and INQUIRE statements brought to subgroup's attention that
a value returned by a SIZE= specifier might change during execution
of an INQUIRE during an asynchronous transfer.

The same cure cribbed from NEXTREC= and applied to POS=
is applied by this paper to SIZE=.

The missing notice in the Introduction is also added.

2. Edits
========

Add a note to the intro

[xvi] "Input/output:" bullet, add a sentence:
"The value set by POS= and SIZE= in an INQUIRE statement
for a unit that has pending asynchronous operations is
now standardized."

{Mark change in intro i/o clause}

The SIZE= specifier in INQUIRE is 9.10.2.30 [245:19-26].
The edit is applied after p3.

At [245:26+] after the paragraph, add a new paragraph:

"If there are pending data transfer operations for the specified unit,
the value assigned is computed as if all the pending data transfers
had already completed."

{The processor may usefully report size when transfers are pending.}
