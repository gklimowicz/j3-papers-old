Subject: UTI-011 GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE/GET_COMMAND examples
Date: 2020-October-05

Reference: 20-007

UTI-011, relative to the GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE example, says:

"Entire example is subsumed by new "auto-allocate intrinargs" feature.
That is, should the above not be replaced by:
CHARACTER(:),ALLOCATABLE :: FILENAME
CALL GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE("DATAFILE", FILENAME)
The same comment applies to the example in GET_COMMAND."

/JOR agrees with this. Edits are provided to correct these issues.
