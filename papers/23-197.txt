Subject: Scoped access to enumeration enumerators
Date: 2023-June-14


1. Introduction

It was suggested that it would be useful to have some kind of scoped
access to the enumerator names of an enumeration type. This could be
provided by the other feature "remote access to module entities",
but it may be nicer to have a version based on the enumeration type name.


2. Proposal

To permit an enumeration type name to be combined with an enumerator name,
allowing use of an enumerator even when it is not visible as a class (1)
name.


3. Illustrative syntax

There is no problem using a single percent sign for this, for example:

    Use dye_colours_m
    Use signalling_m
    Type(dye_colours) x
    Type(signal) y
    ...
    x = dye_colours%red
    y = signal%red
    ...
