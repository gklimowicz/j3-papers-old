Discussion:

The ability to use volatile coarray variables for spin-loops relies on
their definitions and references being atomic.  Instead of specifying
semantics for that case, we propose to add two intrinsic procedures
that have the effect of atomic definition and reference separate from
the volatile attribute.  This approach has the advantage that the
variable could be a structure component without declaring the whole
structure volatile.

An intrinsic subroutine, ATOMIC_DEFINE, assigns the value of the
second argument atomically to the variable specified by the first
argument.  An intrinsic subroutine ATOMIC_REF assigns the value of its
first argument to the second argument atomically.  These can be used
as direct replacements for the definition and reference of a spin-loop
variable. The allowed variables are of type integer and logical, and
shall be of a processor-defined kind.

Given the unique nature of these routines, and a long standing feature
request for other atomic memory operations, a separate category of
atomic intrinsic subroutines is created.

Edits are provided to add these intrinsic subroutines and to remove
the special status of the volatile attribute for coarrays.

EDITS:

[100:5.3.19p1] At the end of the first paragraph of "5.3.19 VOLATILE
attribute" delete ", or by another image without synchronization".


[188:p6] Replace the first sentence of paragraph 6 of "8.5.1 Image
control statements", which reads "A coarray that is default
... coarray in defined." with "A coarray may be referenced or defined
by execution of an atomic intrinsic subroutine during the execution of
a segment that is unordered relative to the execution of a segment in
which the coarray is referenced or defined by execution of an atomic
intrinsic subroutine."

[191:Note 8.38] In Note 8.38 of "8.5.4 SYNC MEMORY", in the example
code segment

Replace the first line with these two lines:

"USE,INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
 LOGICAL(ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND),SAVE :: LOCKED[*] = .TRUE.
 LOGICAL ::  VAL"


in line 7 replace "LOCKED[Q] = .FALSE."
with "CALL ATOMIC_DEFINE (LOCKED[Q], .FALSE.)",

replace line 10 with these four lines:

"VAL = .TRUE.
 DO WHILE (VAL)                  ! segment <Qj>
    CALL ATOMIC_REF (LOCKED, VAL)
 END DO"


[313:13.1p1] In "13.1 Classes of intrinsic procedures" paragraph 1,
replace the whole paragraph with: [Note to Editor: this edit would
replace the corresponding edit in 08-291r2.]

"Intrinsic procedures are divided into seven classes: inquiry
functions, elemental functions, transformational functions, elemental
subroutines, pure subroutines, atomic subroutines, and (impure)
subroutines."

[313:13.1p2+] After paragraph 2 of "13.1 Classes of intrinsic
procedures" add a new paragraph:

"An <<atomic subroutine>> is an intrinsic subroutine that performs an
action on its ATOM argument atomically. The effect of executing an
atomic subroutine is as if the action on the ATOM argument occurs
instantaneously, and thus does not interfere with other atomic actions
that might occur asynchronously."


[316:13.5p2] In the table of Class identifiers in paragraph 2 of "13.5
Standard generic intrinsic procedures" add a new line at the
beginning:

 "  A indicates that the procedure is an atomic subroutine"


[317:Table 13.1] In the generic intrinsic procedure summary table add

"ATOMIC_DEFINE (ATOM, VALUE)   A   Defines ATOM with the value of VALUE"
"ATOMIC_REF    (VALUE, ATOM)   A   Defines VALUE with the value of ATOM"


[327] After "13.7.11 ALLOCATED ..." add two new intrinsic subroutine:

"13.7.11a  ATOMIC_DEFINE (ATOM, VALUE)

Description: Defines ATOM atomically with the value of VALUE.

Class: Atomic subroutine.

Arguments:

ATOM  shall be a scalar of type integer with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND, or
      type logical with kind ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND. ATOMIC_INT_KIND and
      ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND are named constants in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
      intrinsic module. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. ATOM becomes
      defined with the value of VALUE.

VALUE   shall have the same type as ATOM. It is an INTENT(IN) 
        argument.

Example: CALL ATOMIC_DEFINE (I[3], 4) causes I on image 3 to become
defined with the value 4.


13.7.11b ATOMIC_REF (VALUE, ATOM)

Description: Defines VALUE with the value of ATOM referenced atomically.

Class: Atomic subroutine.

Arguments:

VALUE   shall have same type as ATOM. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. 
        VALUE becomes defined with the value of ATOM.

ATOM  shall be a scalar of type integer with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND, or
      type logical with kind ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND. ATOMIC_INT_KIND and
      ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND are named constants in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
      intrinsic module. It is an INTENT(IN) argument.

Example: CALL ATOMIC_REF (I[3], VAL) causes VAL to become defined with
the value of I on image 3."


[395:13.8.2.1+] Add two new subsubclauses to "13.8.2 The
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module" following "13.8.2.1 General":

"13.8.2.1a ATOMIC_INT_KIND

The value of the integer scalar constant ATOMIC_INT_KIND is the kind
type parameter value of type integer variables for which the processor
supports atomic operations specified by atomic subroutines.

13.8.2.1b ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND

The value of the integer scalar constant ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND is the
kind type parameter value of type logical variables for which the
processor supports atomic operations specified by atomic subroutines."
