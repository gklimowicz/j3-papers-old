Subject: Disallow pointer-pointer argument association with co-indexed
actual
Date: 2008 October 29
References: N1723

The present draft seems to allow the following example:

interface
   subroutine sub(x)
      real, pointer, intent(in) :: x
   end subroutine
end interface

if(this_image()==2) then
   call sub(co_array[1]%pointer_component)
end if

The semantics are that if the actual argument is associated, the dummy
argument becomes undefined because otherwise it would become associated
with a target on another image. We see this behavior as very confusing.

We believe this kind of association should explicitly be prohibited
so that users are not misled.

Edits:
========

1. [292:p6] in 12.5.2.5. Move the last sentence to section 12.5.2.6.

2. [292:p1+] in 12.5.2.7. Add a new paragraph after para 1 in 12.5.2.7:
"The actual argument shall not be co-indexed."
