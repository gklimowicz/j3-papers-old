[348:22-35] describes IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG. The FLAG argument is
specified as a scalar. However, the example uses IEEE_ALL
as an argument to IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG. IEEE_ALL is an array.

While it may be useful to specify FLAG as an array,
this is a large change for existing implementations.
The edits correct the example.

Edits:

[348:34-35] Replace the sentence with:
IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG(IEEE_INEXACT) has the value true if the
processor supports the inexact exception.
