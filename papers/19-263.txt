The current goal is to have MPI-4 done in time for Super Computing 2020.

Fault tolerance
--------------------
It looks like some basic fault tolerance functionality will be making it
into the MPI 4.0 standard in 2020. Non-controversial parts of ULFM are
being adopted. The forum is still considering ULFM and the Re-init
proposal. 
(ULFM - User Level Failure Mitigation). 

MPI_Cart_create_weighted
-------------------------------------
Rolf Rabenseifner proposed a new cartesian communicator function called
MPI_Cart_create_weighted. The motivation is to improve performance.  
User supplied weights to indicate the estimated communication intensity
for eacn dimension of an array being spread across the cartesian domain.

Big count
-------------
The "big count" proposal is expected to make it into the MPI 4.0
standard. There's still plenty of discussion about how exactly to
implement it.

Partitioned communication
-------------------------------------
This is a rebranding of a previous proposal known as "fine points".
The point of "partitioned communication" is to provide a simple way
for multiple threads to participate in network operations. In the
proposal, a buffer is partitioned into chunks and different threads
can handle different chunks of the buffer. The current reincarnation
of this proposal suggests the use of a persistent communication API,
whereas the previous proposal was based on plain old send's and recv's.

2. MPI sessions - https://www.mpi-forum.org/bofs/2018-11-sc/sessions.pdf
3. Support for 16-bit floating point operations, e.g., for
   MPI_Allreduce operations used to implement neural networks
