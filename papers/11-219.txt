NUMBER: F03/0116
TITLE: indistinguishable specifics for a generic interface with
       use association
KEYWORDS: GENERIC RESOLUTION USE ASSOCIATION
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Consider the following program

       MODULE M1
         INTERFACE SUBR
           MODULE PROCEDURE SUBR1
         END INTERFACE
       CONTAINS
         SUBROUTINE SUBR1
         END SUBROUTINE
       END

       MODULE M2
         INTERFACE SUBR
           MODULE PROCEDURE SUBR2
         END INTERFACE
       CONTAINS
         SUBROUTINE SUBR2
         END SUBROUTINE
       END

       PROGRAM MAIN
         USE M1
         CALL S
       CONTAINS
         SUBROUTINE S
           USE M2
           CALL SUBR
         END SUBROUTINE
       END

Is this program standard conforming?

ANSWER:

Subclause 12.4.3.4.5 of the Fortran 2008 standard forbids the
presence of such conflicting interfaces.

If, as an extension, a processor allowed duplicate interfaces,
provided one was declared within a scoping unit or accessed by use
assocation, and the other accessed by host association, subclause
12.5.5.2 of the Fortran 2008 standard would be able to resolve the
reference to SUBR in the example.  That does not, however, negate the
prohibition in subclause 12.4.3.4.5.

EDITS:

None.
