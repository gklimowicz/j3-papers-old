NUMBER: F08/0042
TITLE: SOURCE= questions
KEYWORDS: ALLOCATE, SOURCE=
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the program
  PROGRAM example1
  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:),y(:)
  ALLOCATE(x(10),y(10),SOURCE=3.14159265)
  PRINT *,x,y
  END

This program does not conform to Fortran 2003 due to constraint C631
which stated
  "If SOURCE= appears, ... <allocation-list> shall contain only one
   <allocate-object> ...".

The corresponding constraint in Fortran 2008, C638 [127], is missing
this requirement, so apparently the program is now syntactically
correct.

However, the Introduction to the Fortran 2008 standard does not
mention this as a new feature.

Furthermore, 6.7.1.1 paragraph 4 [127] begins
  "If <allocate-object> is a coarray, <source-expr> shall not have a
   dynamic type of ..."
which implies that there is only one <allocate-object> for a
<source-expr> (at least when the <allocate-object> is a coarray).

Similarly, the wording of constraint C639 implies a one-to-one
correspondence between <allocate-object> and <source-expr>.

Q1. Is the omission of the single allocation requirement of Fortran
    2003 an oversight? (i.e. is example1 non-conforming?).

Also, consider the program
  PROGRAM example2
  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x[:]
  ALLOCATE(x[*])
  x = 3
  END

The ALLOCATE statement appears not to conform to Fortran 2008 because
of 6.7.1.1 paragraph 4; since <source-expr> does not appear, it cannot
satisfy any condition about its dynamic type.

Q2. Is an ALLOCATE statement for a coarray required to have SOURCE=?
    (i.e. is example2 non-conforming?).

Also, if multiple allocations with SOURCE= are permitted,
consider the program
  PROGRAM example3
    INTEGER,ALLOCATABLE :: x,y
    ALLOCATE(x,y,SOURCE=f())
    PRINT *,x,y
  CONTAINS
    INTEGER FUNCTION f()
      INTEGER,SAVE :: n = 1
      f = n
      n = n + 1
    END FUNCTION
  END PROGRAM

The execution semantics of SOURCE= in 6.7.1.2 paragraph 7 do not state
whether the <source-expr> is evaluated once per statement or once per
allocation.  If the processor evaluates per statement execution,
something like " 1 1" will be printed, but if it evaluates it per
allocation, something like " 1 2" could be printed.

Q3. How many times may <source-expr> be evaluated in an ALLOCATE
    statement with multiple allocations?

Also, consider the program
  PROGRAM example4
    REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:)
    ALLOCATE(x,SOURCE=[0.5,1.5])
    PRINT *,x
  END PROGRAM

The Introduction implies that this program should be standard-
conforming, but it violates constraint C633, which begins
  "(R631) If <allocate-object> is an array either <allocate-shape-
   spec-list> shall appear or <source-expr> shall appear ..."
The requirements of C633 are not satisfied because R631 is
<allocation> and <source-expr> does not appear in R631.

Q4. Is example4 intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The answer to question 1 is No.
This feature was deliberately added to the Fortran 2008 standard.
Edits are supplied to correct its exposition.

The answer to question 2 is No.
An edit is supplied to correct paragraph 4 of 6.7.1.1.

The answer to question 3 is once.
An edit is supplied to clarify paragraph 7 of 6.7.1.2.

The answer to question 4 is Yes.
An edit is supplied to correct constraint C633.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[xv] Introduction, bullet "Data usage and computation",
  Before "MOLD="
  Insert "Multiple allocations are permitted in a single ALLOCATE
          statement with SOURCE=."
{(Q1) Add new feature to the feature list.}

[126:31-33] Replace C633 entirely with the constraints
  "C633 (R626) If an <allocate-object> is an array, either <allocate-
        shape-spec-list> shall appear in its <allocation>, or <source-
        expr> shall appear in the ALLOCATE statement and have the same
        rank as the <allocate-object>.

   C633a (R631) If <allocate-object> is scalar, <allocate-shape-spec-
         list> shall not appear."
{(Q4) Fix broken constraint.}

[127:5] Constraint C639, replace entirely with
  "C639 (R626) If <source-expr> appears, the kind type parameters of
        each <allocate-object> shall have the same values as the
        corresponding type parameters of <source-expr>."
{(Q1) Fix singular implication.  Avoid introducing any implication
 that each <allocate-object> has the same set of kind type parameters
 or that any <allocate-object> has the same set of kind type
  parameters as the <source-expr> - the relationship is a subset.}

[127:18] 6.7.1.1 paragraph 4, replace entirely with
  "If <source-expr> has a dynamic type of C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, LOCK_TYPE,
   or has a subcomponent whose dynamic type is LOCK_TYPE, no
   <allocate-object> in that statement is permitted to be a coarray."
{(Q2) Fix implied requirement of SOURCE= appearance for coarrays.}

[128:26] 6.7.1.2 paragraph 7, append new sentence
  "The <source-expr> is evaluated exactly once for each execution of
   an ALLOCATE statement."
{(Q3) Clarify number of evaluations.}
