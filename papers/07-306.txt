Subject: UTI 125 (p37): Corresponding co-array for dummy co-arrays

Discussion

The Editor questions the statement at [37:7-8]:
"For each co-array on an image, there is a corresponding co-array with
the same type, type parameters, and bounds on every other image."  for
dummy co-arrays. We believe that the problem lies in Notes 12.30 and
12.31, which are totally reworded papers J3/07-304 and J3/07-305. The
point is that each invocation of a procedure with a co-array dummy
argument establishes a set of corresponding dummy co-arrays for that
invocation on that image.

He also asks us to review nearby text. We did review it for J3/07-257,
but failed to record this. Sorry about that, but had we found problems,
we would have proposed edits.
