Reference: J3/06-007r1, J3/06-252r2


Discussion of issue 87 (page 437)

The constant NULL_IMAGE_TEAM was introduced in response to issue 40 by
J3/06-252r2, which said:

"Yes, it would be a good idea to add INQUIRE(TEAM=). For symmetry with
OPEN, it should return a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM. We will need a null
value for the case where the unit or file is not connected.  Since the
user will need to know the list of images involved, we also need to add
an intrinsic that is given a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM and returns the
list of image indices."

There is a test for the value since TEAM_IMAGES(NULL_IMAGE_TEAM) returns an
array of size zero.
