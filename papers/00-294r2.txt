We need some words in the intro about the new i/o stuff.

EDITS:

xvi:25-27 replace j3 note 209 with (new paragraph):
Section 9 also describes asynchronous input/output,
user-defined derived-type input/output procedures, and stream access.
Asynchronous input/output allows a program to continue
processing executable statements while the
input/output transfer occurs.  User-defined derived-type data transfer
procedures allow input/output of all derived-types under user control.
Stream access allows a file to be treated as a sequence
of  file storage units.
