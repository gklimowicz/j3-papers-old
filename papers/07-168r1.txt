Subject: Further comments on Clause 14
Date:    15 February 2007

In light of having decided not to use the form "if and only if" to specify
the value of logical function results or intent(out) arguments, the
following changes are necessary in Clause 14.

[Editor: Delete ``and only if'' and insert ``; otherwise it has the value
false'' at the end of the sentence at the following places:

457:18-19   458:14-15  459:6-7   459:20-21   459:32-33   460:12-13
460:26-27   461:6-7

The following edit from part 4 of 07-119r2 was overlooked when 07-119r2
was first processed and later agreed; this seems like as good a place as
any to park it so it doesn't get forgotten.

[469:15][It's not clear to what ``Otherwise'' refers.  Editor: Replace
``Otherwise'' by ``If C\_PTR is not a C null pointer''.]
