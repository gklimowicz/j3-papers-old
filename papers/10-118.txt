Subject: JP-8: Terminal point of stream access file
Date: 2010 February 01

This paper provides edits for comment JP-8 from the Ballot summary,
N1802.

Discussion:

At [201:5-6] (9.3.4.1 File position / General) we say "The terminal
point is the position just after the last record or file storage
unit."  The current text for the file position after data transfer for
a formatted stream output statement is not consistent with this. An
edit is provided to make it consistent.

Edits to J3/09-007r3:

[202:24] In 9.3.4.4 "File position after data transfer", paragraph 6,
before "the highest-numbered position" insert "the next position after
".
