Subject: UTI 105: upper co-bounds

Discussion of UTI 105 (pages 368-369)

The editor suggests that the final co-bound of a co-array should be defined
as the greatest value that it can attain, even if not all values of the
earlier subscripts are available when the final co-bound has this value.

We agree and provide edits.  


Edits to J3/07-007

In 13.7.2 "CO_UBOUND (CO_ARRAY [, DIM, KIND])", make the following changes:

[368:5-6] In the Description paragraph, delete 
          "of co-rank greater than one".
          
[368:8+] In the CO_ARRAY paragraph, delete 
          "and of co-rank greater than one".
          
[368:9+] In the DIM paragraph, change "<n-1>" to "<n>".

[369:4] In the Result Characteristics paragraph, line 3, 
        change "<n-1>" to "<n>".
        
[369:6+] At the start of the Result Value paragraph, add 
        "The final upper co-bound is the final co-subscript in
        the co-subscript list for the co-array that selects the
        image with index NUM_IMAGES()."
        
[369:12-13] Replace the Examples paragraph with
  
    "<<Examples.>> If NUM_IMAGES() has the value 32 and A is allocated by
    the statement ALLOCATE (A [2:3, 0:7, *]) then CO_UBOUND (A) is [3, 7, 2]
    and CO_UBOUND (A, DIM=2) is 7."
