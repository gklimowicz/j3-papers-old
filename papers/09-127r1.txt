Subject: Spurious defined terms in clause 9.
Date: 2009 February 10

1. Introduction
---------------

The system for "defining" terms we used in previous versions of the
standard is not in accordance with the ISO guidelines, so we need to stop
using it.  We have already introduced the ISO-compliant defined terms
subclause, and moved/copied many definitions into it.  However, quite a lot
have not been revised.  These should either
  - be turned into normal text ("untermified")
or
  - become proper defined terms.

This paper deals with the terms in clause 9.


2. Terms and what to do with them
---------------------------------

As expected, there are lots of terms here.  Most of the more significant
ones are already proper "defined terms" in clause 1.  We really only need
to make something a proper defined term if it's widely used - for a local
usage, as long as there is no problem with the meaning in context there is
no need to elevate it to clause 1.  Many of these are close calls though.

 - input statement: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index (this isn't a definition even though it claims
   to be one).  Do index "input statement" (and "output statement") at 9.6,
   which is where READ, WRITE and PRINT are defined.

 - reading: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index (this waffle doesn't contribute any real
   information viz add to/subtract from the Computer English meaning).

 - output statement: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index (this isn't a definition even though it claims
   to be one).

 - writing: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index (same comment as for "reading").

 - data transfer input statement: Defined Elsewhere;
   = untermify, Let it be defined elsewhere.

Hang on, please let me in on the secret - what's this other "input
statement" that does not do "data transfer"?

{I.e. why do we have two names for the identical same thing.}

 - data transfer output statement: Ditto;
   = ditto.

 - file connection statement; Used Exactly Once;
   = delete, replace use with "OPEN or CLOSE statement".

 - file inquiry statement: Never Used;
   = delete.

 - file positioning statements: Used Frequently;
   = untermify, do not index (should be indexed in the right place, i.e.
   the file positioning statement subclause).

NOTE: If this is meant to be complete, it is missing classification of WAIT
       and FLUSH!

 - record file: Special Term;
   = termify, index as definition.
   Maybe this isn't used enough to warrant being a term?
   We could just index it instead...

 - stream file: Special Term;
   = termify, index as definition.
   This is used more than "record file"...
   but we could just index it instead.

 - formatted record: Special Term;
   I don't think this is significant enough to be a term, so...
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - unformatted record: Ditto;
   = ditto.

 - endfile record: Special Term, Hardly Used;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - access methods: Special Term, Insignificant, Clause 9 Only;
   = untermify, index not as definition (this isn't the definition!).

 - forms: Ditto;
   = ditto.

 - actions: Ditto;
   = ditto.

 - record length: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - named file: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - position: Normal Usage, Misleading;
   = untermify, index "file position" not as definition.

 - exist: Normal Usage, Multiple Meanings;
   = untermify, index not as definition.
   Actually, we could just omit the indexing here... or index
   "file existence" (viz the subclause title).

 - sequential access: Special Term, Only in Clause 9;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - direct access: Special Term, Only in Clause 9;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - record number: Special Term, Only in Clause 9;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - stream access: Special Term, Only in Clause 9;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - initial point: Normal Usage, Only in Clause 9;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - terminal point: Normal Usage, Only in Clause 9;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - current record: Normal Usage, Widely Used (well, in c09 and c10 anyway);
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - preceding record: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - next record: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index;

 - advancing input/output statement: Not A Definition;
   = untermify, index not as definition.

 - nonadvancing input/output statement: Not A Definition;
   = untermify, index not as definition.

 - exist [second definition!]: Normal Usage, Not A Definition;
   = untermify, index not as definition.
   Actually, I don't think we really need to index it.
   Or we could index "unit existence" instead.

 - preconnection: Special Term, Only In Clause 9;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - OPEN statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - Unicode: Special, Misleading;
   = untermify, index "Unicode file" as definition.

 - CLOSE statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - READ statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - WRITE statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - PRINT statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - control information list: BNF Analogue, Only Used Twice;
   = untermify, index as definition, replace uses with BNF refs.

 - formatted input/output statement: Statement Classification;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - unformatted input/output statement: Statement Classification;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - list-directed input/output statement: Statement Classification;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - namelist input/output statement: Statement Classification;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - asynchronous: Normal Usage, Not A Definition;
   = untermify, index as definition? not as definition?
   This is a close call; even though it's not a definition of
   "asynchronous", it does define the meaning of "asynchronous i/o"...
   maybe we should be indexing "asynchronous i/o" instead?
   Especially since with coarrays we have other asynchronous things
   happening.
   I have put alternative edits in.

 - synchronous: Ditto;
   = ditto.

 - affector: Too Cryptic, Only Used Twice;
   This is always "pending input/output storage sequence affector";
   And the uses have a cross-reference;
   = untermify, do not index.
   (Alternatively, index the whole name "p i/o s s a" both in the defn
   and the use.  I've not put in an alternative edit for that though,
   because then it's too long.)

 - direct access input/output statement: Statement Classification,
                                         Not Used Much;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - sequential access input/output statement: Ditto;
   = ditto.

 - stream access input/output statement: Ditto;
   = ditto.

 - defined input/output: Special Term;
   = termify, index as definition.

 - parent data transfer statement: Mostly Only Used In Clause 9;
   = untermify, index as definition, add cross-ref to use in c13.

 - child data transfer statement: Ditto;
   = untermify, index as definition, add cross-ref to use in c10.

 - wait operation: Mostly Only Used In Clause 9;
   = untermify, index as definition, add cross-ref to use in c16.

 - WAIT statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - BACKSPACE statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - ENDFILE statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - REWIND statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - FLUSH statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - INQUIRE statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - inquire by file: Hardly Used, All In 9.10;
   = untermify, do not index.
   (As far as readability goes, it's not much of an improvement on
    "INQUIRE with a FILE= specifier" anyway.  It's only used 4 times,
    we could just change those and delete the definition.)

 - inquire by unit: Ditto;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - inquire by output list: Ditto;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - end-of-record condition: Special Term, Obvious, Widely Used;
   = untermify, index as definition.
   (This is a close call: we could make it a special term in clause 1,
   but it's so obvious that I don't think we need to do that.)

 - end-of-file condition: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - recursive input/output statement: Special Term, Hardly Used;
   In fact it is only used twice, paras 3 and 5 (after the defn in
   para 2) of 9.12.  It would be easier if we joined all these
   together.
   = untermify, reword, index as definition.


3. Other glitches
-----------------

Missing "statement" after second "INQUIRE" in Note 9.46 on p229.

Missing name on the PROGRAM statement near the end of Note 9.48 on p230.
