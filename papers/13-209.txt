Title: GENERIC statement as alternative to interface block

Submitted by: Van Snyder

Status: For consideration

Basic functionality: Allow a GENERIC statement as an alternative to an
interface block, with syntax similar to its use within a type
definition.

Rationale: Reduces the number of statements, and thereby long-term cost.

Estimated impact: Minor

Markham M6 conformance: Remove simple deficiency and discrepancy.

Detailed specification: Allow a GENERIC statement as an alternative to
an interface block, with syntax similar to its use within a type
definition.

Draft edits: To estimate scope of project

Add an alternative to R207 <declaration-construct>

                <<or>> <generic-stmt>

Replace <procedure-name-list> in R1206 with <specific-procedure-list>

Insert new syntax rule

R1206a <specific-procedure> <<is>> <procedure-name>

Change the reference in C1207 to refer to R1206a.

Insert subclause 12.4.3.2a after subclause 12.4.3.2

"<<12.4.3.2a GENERIC statement>>

"A GENERIC statement specifies a generic identifier for one or more
specific procedures, in the same way as a generic interface block that
does not contain interface bodies.

R1208a <generic-stmt> <<is>> GENERIC [, <access-spec> ] ::
                             <generic-spec> => <specific-procedure-list>

"If <access-spec> appears, it specifies the accessibility (5.3.2) of
<generic-spec>."

Insert a sentence in 12.4.3.4.1p1 before the final sentence:  "A GENERIC
statement specifies a generic interface for each of the procedures named
in its <specific-procedure-list>."

Insert a sentence after the first sentence of 12.4.3.4.1p2:  "The
<generic-spec> in a GENERIC statement is a generic identifier for all of
the procedures named in its <specific-procedure-list>."
