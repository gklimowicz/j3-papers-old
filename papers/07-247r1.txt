KEYWORDS: Procedure, unlimited polymorphic
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS:   J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

    abstract interface
        function foo (x)
            class(*) x
            class(*), pointer :: foo
        end function
    end interface

    procedure (foo), pointer :: proc_ptr
    procedure (foo) proc_tgt

    proc_ptr => proc_tgt


According to the rules of procedure pointer assignment at [144:39-41],
proc_ptr and proc_tgt are required to have the same interface
characteristics.  However because an unlimited polymorphic entity is not
considered to have a declared type, the rules for characteristics of
dummy data objects [256:26-32] and characteristics of function
results [257:2-8] are not applicable. In addition, rules at [145:5-6]
require that proc_ptr and proc_tgt have the same function return type.
This also does not apply to unlimited polymorphic data.

Is the example intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, the example was intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is provided to clarify this.

The characteristics however are adequately defined.  FOO, and thus
both PROC_PTR and PROC_TGT have no type, but are polymorphic; this
precisely characterises an unlimited polymorphic entity.  Only the
requirement of type matching in 7.4.2.2 is incorrect.

EDITS to 04-007:

[145:5] After "the same type"
        insert " or both be unlimited polymorphic".
