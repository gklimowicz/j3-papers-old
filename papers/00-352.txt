          Subject:  When Default KIND Isn't Good Enough - Edits

Rationale
  This paper provides edits for implementing the use of any integer KIND that is defined on the processor for the results of
intrinsic procedures that return integer values and for the I/O specifiers that use integer values.

Edits
  Edits are with respect to the 00-007r3.

  Change scalar-default-int-variable to scalar-int-variable in the following places in chapter 9.
                                                            [175:7]        [179:6]        [180:16,21,24] [196:29,34]    [197:42]
                                             [199:23,37,42] [200:9-12,21]    [201:9]      [202:22,27,30,33,35,39]
               [203:2]        [205:22]

  Statement of intent to the Editor.  I think I got all of them.  However, in case I missed something, you should interpret this
paper as specifying, "Change scalar-default-int-variable to scalar-int-variable everywhere in chapter 9.".

  Following are the edits for the LEN function in chapter 13.
          [314:19]  Add "[, KIND]" immediately before ")".

          [314:22]  Change "Argument" to "Arguments".

          [314:23+] Add:
                 KIND (optional)  shall be a scalar integer initialization expression.

          [314:24]  Change the line to read:
Result Characteristics.  Integer.  If KIND is present, the kind type parameter is that specified by the value of KIND;
otherwise, the kind type parameter is that of default integer type.

  Please make the same changes for the following list of functions in chapter 13.

COUNT
LEN_TRIM
SCAN
UBOUND


INDEX
MAXLOC
SIZE
VERIFY


LBOUND
MINLOC
SHAPE
