----------

At [4:11-12] 1.3.12 has two separate defined terms "automatic data
object" and "automatic object" that mean the same thing. At various
places in the standard we use one or the other, in one case both
within a few lines of each other. It would seem clearer to settle on
just one.  The recent trends seem to favor automatic data
object. Exits are provided to change "automatic object" to "automatic
data object", and eliminate the term "automatic object".
