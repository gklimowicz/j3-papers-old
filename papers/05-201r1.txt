From:       Van Snyder

1. Detailed specification

Allow TYPE(<intrinsic-type>) to specify an intrinsic type.

2. Edits

[71:9-12] Insert a second alternative into <declaration-type-spec> (R502)
"                             <<or>> TYPE ( <intrinsic-type-spec> )"
giving
"R502 <declaration-type-spec> <<is>> <intrinsic-type-spec>
                              <<or>> TYPE ( <intrinsic-type-spec> )
                              <<or>> TYPE ( <derived-type-spec> )
                              <<or>> CLASS ( <derived-type-spec> )
                              <<or>> CLASS ( * )
"

[71:17] In C503, delete "derived-" from "<derived-type-spec>"

[75:7] Within the first paragraph of 5.1.1.1 TYPE replace "a derived" by

"An <intrinsic-type-spec> with the keyword INTEGER specifies the integer type."

[38:7] Within the paragraph after Note 4.8 -- the one that begins "Type type
specifier for the real type..." -- replace "The ... REAL" by "An
<intrinsic-type-spec> with the keyword REAL specifies the real type."

[39:17] At the beginning of the third paragraph of 4.4.3 Complex Type -- the
one that begins "The type specifier for the complex type..." -- replace "The
... COMPLEX" by "An <intrinsic-type-spec> with the keyword COMPLEX specifies
the complex type."

[40:22] Replace the third paragraph of 4.4.5 Logical type by "An
<intrinsic-type-spec> with the keyword CHARACTER specifies the character type."
