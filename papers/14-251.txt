Discussion
----------

The changes proposed here are based on changes suggested in my ballot,
see N2031. The reason for each change is given with the edit.

Edits to N2007:
---------------
[5:11+] Add
"<3.2a>
<established coarray>
coarray that is accessible within a CHANGE TEAM construct from outside
the construct (5.1)"
Reason: The term "established" is used quite a bit. I think we need a
definition.

[10:27] Change
"a coarray that does not appear in a <coarray-association>"
to
"a coarray that is not an associating entity".
Reason. The present wording suggests that a coarray established outside
the construct is not accessible if it appears in a <coarray-association>.

[14:7+] Delete the final sentence of NOTE 5.8: "An image ... reason."
Reason: No longer correct.

[17:19] Change "atomic memory operations" to "atomic actions".
Reason. This is the terminology that we are using, see earlier in this
paragraph.

[19:25] Change "bitwise AND" to "atomic".
[19:38] Change "compare" to "atomic".
[20:4] Change "compare and swap" to "atomic".
[20:15&19] Change "add" to "atomic".
[20:30&34] Change "bitwise AND" to "atomic".
[21:5&9] Change "bitwise OR" to "atomic".
[21:20&24] Change "bitwise exclusive OR" to "atomic".
[21:36] Change "bitwise OR" to "atomic".
[22:9] Change "bitwise exclusive OR" to "atomic".
Reason. In all these cases, it is the atomic nature of the operation
that is important. What is done has already been stated.

[19:11, 19:23, 20:1, 20:16, 20:31, 21:6, 21:21, 21:34, 22:7]
Replace "type integer" with "integer type with a minimum decimal
exponent range of four".
Reason: For consistency with changes made to the standard in 14-168r4.

[22:20, 22:38, 23:18, 24:1, 24:28, 25:5, 28:28] Replace
"type default integer" with "integer type with a minimum decimal
exponent range of four".
Reason: We do not need to require these STAT arguments to be of type
default integer.

[27:20] Before "have initiated" add "are known to".
[27:25] Before "have initiated" add "be known to".
[27:26] Change "has initiated" add "is known to have initiated".
[27:27] Before "have initiated" add "are known to".
Reason: This should be like FAILED_IMAGES and only list the images it
already knows have stopped.

[31:26 to 32:27] Replace by
"{In 1.3 Terms and definitions, insert the new terms of Clause 3 of this
Technical Specification.}"
Reason. It is safer to define the terms once in the TS.

[35:13] Replace  "as many times as has image M" by
"{\ul in the current team} as many times as has image M
{\ul since execution last began in this team}".
Reason. On leaving a CHANGE TEAM construct, we need to ignore the
SYNC ALLs executed within it because their numbers may differ.
