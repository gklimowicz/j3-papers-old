NUMBER: 000088
TITLE: INTRINSIC statement and attribute
KEYWORDS: intrinsic
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
 
Is it possible for a variable or external procedure that has the same
name as the specific name of an intrinsic function listed in section
13.13 of the Fortran 95 standard and not marked with a bullet to be used
as an actual argument?

For example, consider the following program:

  module SCREEN
    type :: COLOR
      integer :: RED, GREEN, BLUE
    end type COLOR
  contains
    subroutine SET_BACKGROUND ( WHAT )
      type(color), intent(in) :: WHAT
      ! Call to set the background color
    end subroutine SET_BACKGROUND
  end module SCREEN

  program TEST_SCREEN
    use SCREEN
    real, external :: DIM
    character(len=15) :: SIGN
    real :: SIN
    type(color) :: TAN = color(210,180,140)
    call color_intensity ( dim )
    call biblical ( sign )
    call cardinal ( sin )
    call set_background ( tan )
  end program TEST_SCREEN


Notice that the actual arguments have the names of specific intrinsic
functions listed in section 13.13 of the Fortran 95 standard, but they do
not appear in an INTRINSIC statement, nor are they given the INTRINSIC
attribute in a type declaration statement, as required by the penultimate
normative paragraph of 12.3.2.3 of the Fortran 95 standard [198:7-9].


ANSWER: The answer to the question in the first paragraph is yes.

Fortran has no reserved words. In the scope of the above main program,
none of the names DIM, SIGN, SIN and TAN are names of intrinsic
procedures. The paragraph referenced reads:

   If the specific name of an intrinsic function (13.13) is used as an
   actual argument, the name shall either appear in an INTRINSIC
   statement or be given the INTRINSIC attribute in a type declaration
   statement in the scoping unit.

and tells us that SIN does not refer to the intrinsic procedure. The
names DIM, SIGN, and TAN can be indentified from their declarations not
to be intrinsic procedures. Since none of the names are those of intrinsic
procedures, the paragraph does not affect their use as the names of 
actual arguments. The edit makes the meaning clearer. 

EDIT: 

Page 198, Subclause 12.3.2.4, replace line 7 of page 198 [198:7] by
'If a specific intrinsic function (13.13) is used as an actual
argument, its name shall'
