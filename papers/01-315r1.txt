Subject:  Response to a WG5 comment (value attribute)

Wg5 resolution L4 in N1443 endorsed N1462, which, among other
things, suggested allowing the VALUE attribute for procedures
other than BIND(C) ones.  A unanimous J3 straw vote agreed
with this recommendation.  The edits to do it are:

  {Remove the constraint}
  [65:15-16] Delete c528

  {Target xref more precisely}
  [77:12] "12.4.1" -> "12.4.1.2"

  {Delete earlier waffle in favor of more precise specification
  added later (and xrefed right above)}
  [77:13-18] Delete note 5.21

  {This rationale is no longer sufficient, because VALUE can
  apply to non-C stuff.  If we felt a rationale was needed, the
  C section wouldn't be the right place for it.  Just let the
  normative text stand.}
  [361:28-30] Delete note 15.16

  {Delete incorrect statement.}
  [477:29-30] Delete the sentence "Note...attribute."
