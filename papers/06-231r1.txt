Subject: C16 - UTI 75 : endian ordering
Date:    14-aug-2006

---------------------

Unresolved Technical Issue 75 (page 497) suggests that the sentence
"The ordering of these consecutive numeric storage units is processor
dependent." at [497:8-9] needs additional explanation. A Note is
suggested.

Reply: This text is in the wrong subclause. It belongs in the storage
sequence subclause (16.5.3.2). An edit is provided to fix that. A Note
along the lines suggested is also provided.

Edits:
------

[499:28+] Move the text at [497:7-11] to [499:28+] as list item (3)
and renumber the subsequent items.  (Note that at [499:35] the text
"in items (1)-(6)", which is currently nonsense, will be correct once
that item is renumbered as (7).)

[499:37] Replace "of item (4)" with "of item (5)".

[500:8+] Add a Note:

Note 16.14a
For a BITS value with a kind equal to an integer multiple of the size
of a numeric storage unit, the order of its storage units may depend on
the endian convention for the processor's memory. For example, on a system
where the size of a numeric storage unit is 32 bits,

 BITS(32) :: X(2)
 BITS(64) :: Y, ZLE, XBE

 Y  = z'0123456789abcdef'

 X = TRANSFER(Y, X)
 ZBE = X(1)//X(2)
 ZLE = X(2)//X(1)

! On some processors Y==ZLE is true and on other processors Y==ZBE is true.
[end Note]
