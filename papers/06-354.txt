137:7+ Table 7.1 appears to be incomplete as far as bits go. It
does not allow B == I, although it allows I == B and
it does not allow bits to be used in any of the > or <
type operations. The text in 138:21 and 153:10 describe
how the operations should work.


I couldn't find the text that describes how B'001' == B'1' works.
Surely the shorter one is padded on the left with zeros, I just couldn't
find the words.
