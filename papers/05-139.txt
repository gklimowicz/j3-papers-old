QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m

  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i = 0
  CONTAINS
    PROCEDURE, PRIVATE :: pwf
    GENERIC :: WRITE(FORMATTED) => pwf
  END TYPE

CONTAINS

  RECURSIVE SUBROUTINE pwf(dtv, unit, iotype, vlist, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(t),         INTENT(IN)    :: dtv
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: unit
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: vlist(:)
    INTEGER,          INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg
    WRITE(unit, '(i1, /)') dtv%i
    WRITE(unit, '(t1, a2)') 'AB'
  END SUBROUTINE pwf

END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  IMPLICIT NONE
  TYPE(t) :: a
  a%i = 3
  PRINT *, 'xyz', a
end program


9.5.3.7.2 states:
  A record positioning edit descriptor, such as TL and TR, used on
  unit by a child data transfer statement shall not cause the record
  position to be positioned before the record position at the time the
  user-defined derived-type input/output procedure was invoked.

The term "record position" is used, but it doesn't appear to be
defined anywhere.  Depending on the interpretation, the above program
might be standard-conforming, or it might not be.

If "record position" is taken to mean "the position within the current
record", regardless of which record is the current record, then the
record position at the beginning of the UDDTIO procedure is before the
fourth character of the record.  The first child data transfer
statement begins a new record, and the second child data transfer
statement writes to the first character of the new record.  This would
be before the "record position" at the time the UDDTIO procedure was
invoked, and the program would not be standard-conforming.

If "record position" is taken to mean a combination of the record and
the position within that record (essentially making it mean the same
thing as "file position"), then the above program is standard-
conforming, since the control edit descriptor doesn't cause the file
to be positioned before the record position when the UDDTIO procedure
was invoked.

What is the meaning of "record position", and is the above program
standard-conforming?


ANSWER:

The term "record position" means the same as the term "file position".
The program is standard-conforming.


EDITS:

None.
