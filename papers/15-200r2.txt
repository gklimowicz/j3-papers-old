1. Unresolved Technical Issue 008

Paragraph 9 of 15.5.4 "Macros and typedefs in ISO_Fortran_binding.h"
currently says:

"Additional nonnegative processor-dependent type specifier values may
be defined for Fortran intrinsic types that are not represented by
other type specifiers and noninteroperable Fortran derived types that
do not have type parameters, type-bound procedures, final subroutines,
allocatable components, or pointer components."

The editor remarks, "Is the processor required to define a nonnegative
type specifier value for the above cases?" and cites 15.3.7 which also
specifies which values the *type* member of a C descriptor may take.

Paper 15-119r2 attempted to address this issue, but the associated
edits were rejected. The text in question was added by 11-173r1 which
suggested there was a use case for distinct type codes for
noninteroperable derived types that were "copyable", but pushing this
off on the individual processor is problematic in usage and does not
aid portability.

This paper proposes to resolve UTI 008 by clarifying the wording
and deleting the text relating to noninteroperable derived types
having processor-defined type codes.

2. Unresolved Technical Issue 012

Paragraph 4 of 15.3.7 "Interoperability of procedures and procedure
interfaces" attempts to explain how a C descriptor shall be filled
in for a reference from C. The editor properly objects that the
terminology used in this paragraph is incorrect and that, in
particular, the text relating to the *type* member is inconsistent
with text in 15.5.4. Edits are supplied to rectify this.

Edits:

("Intended effective argument" is not a defined term, but "effective
argument" is: "entity that is argument-associated with a dummy argument".
The idea is that the descriptor, which is the actual argument,
describes the item that is the intended effective argument.)

[461:31,15.3.7p4] Replace "for the actual argument" in the first sentence
of this paragraph with "for the intended <effective argument>".

[462:1,15.3.7p4] Replace "same characteristics as the actual argument"
with "same characteristics as the intended <effective argument>".

[462:3,15.3.7p4] Replace "value from Table 15.4 that depends on the
effective argument" with "value that depends on the intended
<effective argument>".

[462:4,15.3.7p4] Replace "effective argument" with "intended <effective
argument>".

[462:6-9,15.3.7p4] Replace the second bullet "If the dynamic type...
no corresponding type..." with "If the <dynamic type>
of the intended <effective argument> is interoperable with a Fortran
intrinsic type for which the processor defines a nonnegative type
specifier value not found in Table <15-4>, that type specifier value."
(deleting text regarding noninteroperable derived types).

[467:6-8] Replace paragraph 9 "Additional nonnegative
processor-dependent..." with the following:

If the processor supports interoperability of Fortran intrinsic types
that correspond to C types not listed in Table <15-4>, the processor
shall define additional, positive type specifier values for those
types.
