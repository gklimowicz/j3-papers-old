Discussion of issue 75 (page 494)
 
The second sentence of list item (3) in 16.5.3.2 "Storage sequence" is
unnecessary given the more complete explanation of the same issue in
Note 16.13 on the following page.  The editor recommends deleting the
sentence.

Edit to 06-007r1:

[494:24:25] Delete the sentence "The ordering of these consecutive
numeric storage units is processor dependent.".
