[233:32-38]---------------------------------------------------------------
We have ASCII, ISO 10646 or DEFAULT character kinds.  What's wrong with
ASCII files?

Editor: Insert ", ASCII," after "UTF-8" at [233:32].  Insert "The value
ASCII specifies that the encoding form of the file is ASCII as specified
in ISO/IEC 646:1991.  Such a file is called an <<ASCII file>> and all
characters therein are of ASCII type.  The value ASCII shall not be
specified if the processor does not support the ASCII character type."
after "type." at [233:36].

Replace [278:3] by
"During input from an ASCII file,

o  characters in the record that correspond to a character variable
   shall have the kind of the character variable, and

o  characters in the record that correspond to a numeric, logical, or
   bits variable shall be of ASCII character type.

During input from a file that is neither Unicode nor ASCII,"

At [279:3+] insert a new paragraph

"During output to an ASCII file, characters transmitted to the record as a
result of processing a character string edit descriptor or as a result of
evaluating a numeric, logical, bits or ASCII character data entity, are of
type ASCII character.

At [279:4] replace "non-Unicode file" by "file that is neither Unicode nor
ASCII".
