This is mostly typos and similar, perhaps this paper can be passed
directly to the Editor.

Edits:

{values of variables need storage, not space}

[92:17] replace "space" by "storage"

{contiguous characters ?}

[95:35-36] vs. [95:42] ?

{add example of context requiring bounds}

[98:31+] add Note 5.12+
"For example, an assumed-size array may not be the array argument
to the intrinsic inquiry function UBOUND since the upper bounds,
and hence the shape, are not all known in the scope where
the array is assumed-size."

{thingo,thingo-list}

[99:1] is R524 right?

{block data is obsolescent}

[99:23] small font "or block data subprogram"

{locks v events ?}

[100:8-9] how 'bout event_type thingos?

{use more formal English}

[104:11-] In Note 5.24, in the last sentence,
replace "end up at" with "encounter"

{what is this trying to say?}

[105:36-37] what is "If an identifier is accessed from another
module and also declared locally, it has the default accessibility
of a local identifier."

If it is accessed via use, how did I declare it locally?

{an example for implicit none external ?}

[114:1-] after Note 5.39, insert Note 5.39+
"In the following example,

PROGRAM USESUB
IMPLICIT NONE( EXTERNAL)

REAL, EXTERNAL :: G

REAL :: X, Y

   X = F(Y)      ! Illegal! F must be given the external attribute

   Y = G(X)      ! Legal, G explicitly has the external attribute

END PROGRAM USESUB

the referenced function F must be explicitly given the EXTERNAL
attribute.  This might be done via an EXTERNAL statement, an
EXTERNAL keyword on the type declaration of F,
or an INTERFACE block."
