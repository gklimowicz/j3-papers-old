Subject:   UTI 151 concerning USE and submodules
Reference: 09-007
Date: 2009 February 09

The prohibition against a submodule accessing or referencing its
ancestor module by use association appears to have been wrong-headed in
the first place.  There appears to be no reason to keep it in any form.

An important feature of the submodule design is that the ancestor module
is completely defined without reference to any of its submodules.
Therefore there is no problem caused by a submodule accessing its
ancestor module by use association.

Editor: Delete the final sentence ("A submodule ... indirectly") of
12.2.2..1p1, and UTI 151.

Editor: Delete NOTE 11.7.

Note to J3:  Any non-module program unit, including any submodule, can
access any module by use association, because all the modules can be
processed before any of the non-module program units.
