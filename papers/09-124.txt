Subject: Spurious defined terms in clause 6.
Date: 2009 January 29

1. Introduction
---------------

The system for "defining" terms we used in previous versions of the
standard is not in accordance with the ISO guidelines, so we need to stop
using it.  We have already introduced the ISO-compliant defined terms
subclause, and moved/copied many definitions into it.  However, quite a lot
have not been revised.  These should either
  - be turned into normal text ("untermified")
or
  - become proper defined terms.

This paper deals with the terms in clause 6.


2. Terms and what to do with them
---------------------------------

 - substring: BNF Term Analogue, Frequently Used;
   = untermify, index as definition.
   (This is borderline: even though it is widely used, why should we have
    two index entries one for the BNF and one for the analogue?  Surely
    just one for the BNF is sufficient?)

 - starting point: Misleading, Obvious;
   = untermify, reword as "substring starting point" everywhere,
     index as definition of "substring starting point".
   (Most places already have "substring starting point".)

 - ending point: Misleading, Obvious;
   = untermify, reword as "substring ending point" everywhere,
     index as definition of "substring ending point".
   (Most places already have the correct wording.)

 - base object: Special Term;
   = termify, index as definition.

 - array element order: Fairly Obvious, Widely Used;
   = termify, index as definition.

 - stride: BNF Term Analogue;
   = untermify, index as use of the BNF term.
   (Note c07 usage conflict.  Deal with that in another paper.)

 - simply contiguous: Special Term;
   = termify as sub-term of "contiguous", index as definition.

 - image selector: BNF Term Analogue;
   = untermify, do not index.
   (This is already where the BNF is defined.)

 - allocated: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - unallocated: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - NULLIFY statement: It's A Statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.


3. Edits to 09-007
------------------

[4:6+(1.3.7+)] Define term
  "\term{base object}
   of a \si{data-ref}, the object designated by the leftmost
   \sinr{part-name} (6.4.2)"
{6.4.2 is \ref{D6:Structure components}.}

[throughout] Hyperlink "base object" and index as appropriate.

[somewhere in c01] Define sub-term of "contiguous"
  "\subterm{simply contiguous}
   of an array designator or variable, satisfying the conditions specified
   in 6.5.4
   \begin{note}
   These conditions are simple ones which make it clear that the designator
   or variable designates a contiguous array.
   \end{note}"
{6.5.4 is \ref{D6:Simply contiguous array designators}.}

[throughout] Hyperlink "simply contiguous" and index as appropriate.

[119:8(6.4.1p1)] Unembolden "substring", index as definition.

[119:16(6.4.1p2)] Replace "is called the <<starting point>>"
                  with    "is the starting point of the substring",
                  index as definition of "substring starting point".

[119:17(6.4.1p2)] Replace "is called the <<ending point>>"
                  with    "is the ending point of the substring".
                  index as definition of "substring ending point".

[123:1(6.5.3.2p1)] Unembolden "array element order",
                   index 6.5.3.2 as definition.

[124:14(6.5.3.3.1p1)] "A subscript triplet"->"A \si{subscript-triplet}".
{When we're talking "designates", let's start with the BNF since that is in
 fact what is doing the designation.  It also gets a reference to the BNF
 of <subscript-triplet> into the subclause discussing them.}

[124:15(6.5.3.3.1p1)] All in the one sentence:
                      "third expression" -> "\si{stride}",
                      "triplet is"->"triplet specifies",
                      "and is called the <<stride>>"->delete.
{Reword to simplify and reference the syntax term.}

[126:20(6.5.5p1)] Unembolden "image selector", do not index.

[130:1(6.6.1.2p1)] "<<allocated>>"->"``allocated''", do not index.
{That is, it should appear in quotes to make the sentence readable.}

[130:6(6.6.1.2p1)] "<<unallocated>>"->"``unallocated''", do not index.
{This sentence is readable without the quotes, but put them in for
 consistency with the previous item.}

[130:37(6.6.2p1)] Unembolden "NULLIFY statement", index as statement.
