1. Introduction
===============

Annex B appears to an uninitiated reader as a list in B.1 of things
introduced in Fortran 90 that were deleted in Fortran 2008, and a list
in B.2 of things introduced in Fortran 2008 that are being deleted in
the current revision.  Everything deleted was present in Fortran 90, but
was deleted in three different revisions.

2. Edits
========

[531:4+] Insert a subclause heading "B.1.1 Reason for deletion"

[531:6+] Move [531:35 B.1p3] here.  Then insert a subclause heading
"B.1.2 Features deleted from Fortran in 2003".

[531:28+] Insert a subclause heading "B.1.3 Features deleted from
Fortran in 2008".

[532:1] Change the title and level of the subclause to "B.1.4 Features
deleted from Fortran in 2015".

[532:2-3 B.2p1-2] Delete two now-redundant paragraphs.

Maybe use the itemize environment instead of the enum environment,
because B.1.3 will have only one item (Vertical format control).
Alternatively use ordinary text instead of subclause headings to
separate the lists.
