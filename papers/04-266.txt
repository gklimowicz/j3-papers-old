Subject: Proposed positions on Canadian FCD comments

Edit subgroup has studied the Canadian FCD comments and
recommends the following positions on them.

T1. Agree.  Also in the US position.

T2. Agree.  Voted on at mtg166, but omitted from submitted US
    position by scribal error.

T3. Agree there is a problem.  Same as 04-228 item 2.
    We have a different proposed fix in 04-228r1.

E1. Agree.  Also need to change triangle to object on lines
    11 and 12 (twice each line).
