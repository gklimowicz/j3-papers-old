This does not qualify as an interp. The examples are non-conforming.

The first example changes the value of an INTENT(IN) argument.  The
second example needs a SYNC ALL after the first coarray = 0 to make it
conforming but it is still an uninteresting piece of code because coarray
is set to zero on every image, so the later setting it to zero again on
image 2 achieves nothing.

There will be no further processing of this paper.

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION 1:

Is the following program required to set some elements of array_1 to 10
times those of array_2 and the rest to zero?

PROGRAM Main
    INTEGER :: array_1(9), array_2(9)
    array_2 = (/ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 /)
    array_1 = Fred(array_2)
    PRINT *, array_1
CONTAINS
    IMPURE ELEMENTAL FUNCTION Fred (arg)
        INTEGER, INTENT(IN), TARGET :: arg
        Fred = 10*arg
        IF (arg == 4) array_2 = 0
     END FUNCTION Fred
END PROGRAM Main


QUESTION 2:

Is the following program intended to be conforming?  And, if so, is it
required to set some elements of array to 10 times those of coarray and
the rest to zero?


PROGRAM Main
    INTEGER :: coarray(9)[*], array(9)
    array = (/ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 /)
    coarray = 0
    IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) THEN
        array = Fred(coarray)
    ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 2) THEN
        SYNC ALL
        coarray = 0
        SYNC ALL
    END IF
    SYNC ALL
    IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) PRINT *, array
CONTAINS
    IMPURE ELEMENTAL FUNCTION Fred (arg)
        INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: arg
        Fred = 10*coarray(arg)[2]
        IF (arg == 4) THEN
            SYNC ALL
            SYNC ALL
        END IF
     END FUNCTION Fred
END PROGRAM Main


DISCUSSION:

There are many similar examples that could be written, but the generic
question is what the standard requires (if anything) if the restrictions
C1276 to C1288 for pure subprograms are broken in impure elemental
procedures.  One possible option would be to state explicitly that the
effects of breaking any of those rules in an impure elemental procedure
is processor-dependent.  I believe that is what is intended.

Restricting the question to just the coarray issues, the answer to this
will affect the data consistency and progress models considerably,
especially in combination with atomic accesses.  The question then
becomes whether those models need take account of impure elemental
procedures, or can simply ignore them.

The best answer would be "no", but the standard needs to make that clear
in some way.

Awaiting statement of direction.
