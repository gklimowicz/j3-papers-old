Discussion:

In the bullet list in "Image control statements", the sixth item
doesn't cover CYCLE, multilevel EXIT, or branching out of a block.


Edit to J3/08-007r2:

[187: 8.5.1p2] In the sixth item of the bullet list in "Image control
statements":

Delete ", END BLOCK,", then insert another item:

"o Any statement that completes execution of a block (8.1.2.2) and
   results in implicit deallocation of a coarray."
