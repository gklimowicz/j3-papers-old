Subject: Issue 141 and a related problem

1. Introduction

The editor is still unhappy about pointer assignment and type parameters.
Now, we may have gotten things wrong here, but the specific complaints
raised in 141 seem to be completely spurious.  (Still, at least it had
the effect of making me re-read the section and noticing that something
appeared to be wrong).

Section 2 will deal with issue 141.

Section 3 will attempt to deal with nearby problems that may exist (but
which are not issues).

2. Issue 141 details

Issue 141 says:

>What about type parameters in other cases where deferred type parameters
>are not currently defined?

These cases are addressed by the text inserted by 99-185r4.

>Paper 99-185r4 partly addressed this question, but it appears incomplete.
>It mentions only the case where target is a disassociated pointer.

Actually, it mentions "NOT A DISASSOCIATED POINTER" (emphasis mine).

>Three paras earlier, we felt it necessary to separately mention the cases
>where target is a pointer with undefined association status

An undefined pointer is "not a disassociated pointer", so we seem to have
addressed this case (whether we got it right or not is another matter).

>and where it was a reference to the NULL function.  Why
>did we have to distinguish those there and not here?

Well, maybe we did not need to distinguish those earlier.
I don't think this is sufficiently confusing to rate an issue.

>Perhaps the NULL function case is ok - I'm not quite sure why we
>distinguished that before (doesn't seem to me particularly different from
>some other function that returns a dissasociated pointer).

I think it is just an attempt to be careful in talking about the syntax
"<target>" and not the actual "target".  But another paper has attempted to
clarify the situation (see issue 222).

In any case, issue 222 (which boils down to "we have too many targets")
is an adequate pointer to the target confusion; therefore we can just
delete this part of the issue.

>But a pointer with undefined association
>status is certainly different from a disasociated pointer.

INDEED!!!!!!!!!!!

Therefore, undefined pointers are covered.

>Also the former version of issue 141 mentioned the case where a null
>(should have said disassociated, I guess) pointer is an actual argument for
>a pointer dummy.  I see no edits or comments about that case.  Can I assume

It seems to me that it is adequately addressed by issue 79, which also
occurs within the chapter which contains the purported problem.

>Or was this issue closed without actually checking that all the questions
>it raised were addressed?

No, we considered that this was simply a duplicate of issue 79.

>Also, I find myself greatly confused by the revision that paper 99-185r1

You need to read it more carefully.

>The former version of this para said that *ALL* nondeferred type parameters
>of pointer-object had to agree with the corresponding type parameters of
>target.  The new version appears to allow disagreement as long as the type
>parameter of target is deferred.  This doesn't make sense to me.

And it wouldn't make sense to me either; but it is not what the text says.

The text has "not a disassociated pointer" and "otherwise".

The lack of agreement requirement is governed by the "otherwise",
i.e. applies only to disassociated pointers.

>(And this
>isn't a constraint, so its not just a matter of checkability).  There were
>words explicitly added to single out that case, so its presumably not just
>a matter of forgetting about the case.

Right - for disassociated pointers, deferred type parameters have no
defined value (one is not allowed even to ask about them).  So it would be
meaningless to attempt to require a defined value (defined by virtue of not
being deferred) to be equal to a value that does not exist and that you are
not allowed to ask about (because it is a deferred type parameter of a
disassociated pointer).

Perhaps two examples to clarify the situation:
  CHARACTER*10,POINTER :: p1
  CHARACTER*(:),POINTER :: p2 => NULL()
  p1 => p2

In this example, p1=>p2 is legal.  There is no requirement on the
non-defined type parameter of p2 (the type parameter has no value).

  SUBROUTINE s(p1,p3)
  CHARACTER*10,POINTER :: p1
  CHARACTER*(N),POINTER :: p3
  p1 => p3

In this example, p1=>p3 is legal only if N==10, because there is a
requirement on the well-defined type parameter of p2.

3. Nearby Problems

99-185r4 deliberately put undefined pointers into the same category as
associated pointers (for the purposes of type parameter checking).  On
reflection, I believe that this is an obvious mistake (since their deferred
parameters have no values to be checked) and that therefore they ought to
be in the same category as disassociated pointers.

I note that this has the unfortunate side-effect of preventing immediate
runtime detection of type parameter value mismatch when the LHS (pointer)
has a non-deferred parameter and the RHS (target) has a deferred parameter
[because it is, in general, impossible to tell the difference between an
associated pointer and an undefined pointer].  Apparently, the best a
checking compiler can do is to set the pointer to a special "undefined"
state when this happens and flag it later when it is used (if at all) - and
give a slightly confusing error message, viz "use of undefined pointer or
type parameter mismatch in earlier pointer assignment".

If this situation is felt to be unacceptable the only obvious way out of it
is to forbid the RHS to have a deferred type parameter matching the LHS's
non-deferred type parameter.  E.g. if the target is a "CHARACTER*(:)"
pointer or allocatable, then the pointer must also be "CHARACTER*(:)" and
not "CHARACTER*10".  This would not be an F95 compatibility issue because
F95 did not have deferred type parameters, even for CHARACTER.

4. Edits to 00-007

[137:22] After "not a disassociated pointer"
         insert "or undefined pointer".
{Move pointers with undefined association status to the "otherwise" clause.}

[137:27-51] Delete.
{Please.}
