Subject: Interpretation concerning intrinsic functions with DIM argument
From: Van Snyder
Date: 2010 June 13

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F08/0003
TITLE: Is a disassociated pointer allowed as an actual DIM argument?
KEYWORDS: DIM argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Under consideration

QUESTION:

Several intrinsic functions, such as ANY, have a DIM argument, with
the rank of the result depending upon whether it is present.  There is
a prohibition against the actual argument being an optional dummy
argument, but not against it being a disassociated pointer or
deallocated allocatable.  Is the following program standard
conforming, and if so what does it print?

  program DIM_Arg
    integer, pointer :: Dim => NULL()
    logical :: Mask(2,2) = &
      & reshape( (/ .true., .false, .false, .true. /), (/ 2, 2 /) )
    print *, shape( any(mask,dim) )
  end program DIM_Arg

The description worked until we allowed a disassociated pointer or
unallocated allocatable variable that is associated with a nonpointer
nonallocatable optional argument to be interpreted not to be present.

ANSWER:

It was intended that this program not conform.

It was an oversight that disassociated pointer and unallocated
allocatable actual arguments were not prohibited to correspond to DIM
dummy arguments for these intrinsic functions.

Edits are provided to clarify this.  These functions were intended to
behave similarly to MAXLOC et al, where this issue does not arise. 
Edits are provided to change the descriptions accordingly.
