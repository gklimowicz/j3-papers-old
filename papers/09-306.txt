1.1.13 Comments from members

   /INTERP report (from Stan Whitlock):

     The new 09-006Ar3 is the latest list of F2003 interps:

       + m189 interps: submitted 134..138; passed F95/98, 78, 90,
                       134..138

     There is one new interp and no new answers in the m190 pre-meeting:

       * Paper 09-296 is interp F03/0139

       * Paper 09-295 is the results of the interp letter ballot #19
         (09-292)

     Meeting 190 is the last meeting to accept interpretations against
     Fortran 2003;  starting at meeting 191, interps will be against
     Fortran 2008.

   Van Snyder attended the IFIP WG2.5 meeting.  They liase with
   IEEE/P1758 Interval Arithmetic.  WG2.5 is working on "complete
   arithmetic" that would allow no lose of accuracy for combined
   multiply/add operations.

   Craig Rasmussen says that Apple is pushing OpenCL as a language to
   unify GPU and multi-core programs.

   has been involved with Fortran.
