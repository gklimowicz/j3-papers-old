QUESTION:

The Fortran 95 standard [53:13-17] says
"Constraint: A dummy argument with the INTENT(IN) attribute, or a subobject
of
             such a dummy argument, shall not appear as
             ...
             (2) The <pointer-object> of a <pointer-assignment-stmt>,
             ..."

Consider:

  TYPE t
    REAL,POINTER :: value
  END TYPE
  ...
  SUBROUTINE s(x)
    TYPE(t),INTENT(IN) :: x
    IF (.FALSE.) x%value => NULL()                   ! (1)
    IF (.FALSE.) NULLIFY(x%value)                    ! (2)

According to the constraint above, line (1) is illegal.
However, there is no corresponding constraint for the NULLIFY statement,
implying that line (2) is legal.

Should subobjects of INTENT(IN) dummies also be constrained against
appearing as the <pointer-object> of a NULLIFY statement?
