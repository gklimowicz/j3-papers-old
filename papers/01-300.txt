From:    WG5 members
Subject: Interpretation JP-17 (Multiple occurrence of namelist group
         object in namelist group)

follows. The current version is attached for your convenience.

                                  ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5  N1464

Suggested answer for JP-17

Preferred Answer to Interpretation JP-17

It is recommended that the interpretation should be processed as it
stands.  It is clear from the text that the possibility (of a variable
name appearing more than once in a single namelist) simply was not
considered.  Allowing this would not appear to offer functionality,
merely a chance for the user to make a mistake.

Alternative Answer to Interpretation JP-17

If the preferred answer to JP-17 is rejected, it was noted that there
were no clear semantics for the multiple occurrence situation.  Here is
the alternative answer in that situation.

ANSWER:

It is permissible for a variable to appear twice in a single namelist.
An edit is supplied to clarify the semantics in this situation.

EDIT:

[66:10+] Append new sentence

"If a variable appears more than once in a namelist group its value is
written once for each appearance, in the order of each appearance."
