Discussion
----------

We propose here several independent changes to the collectives.

The principal argument of no collective should be permitted to be
coindexed. It was not intended to allow this.

It was not intended that the existence of defined assignment for the
type and type parameters of the argument A of CO_REDUCE should have
any bearing on the result of CO_REDUCE.

Reasonable limitations should be imposed on the arguments of the
OPERATOR function to limit the variants of CO_REDUCE that an
implementation needs to provide.

Edit are provided to clarify these issues.
