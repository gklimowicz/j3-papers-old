Introduction
------------

The DIS often breaks paragraphs at the end of a list.  I found
cases where the paragraph breaks seem inappropriate.  In one
case, a sentence is split across two paragraphs.  In another
case, the antecedent of a reference is made ambiguous by a
paragraph break.  Other breaks appear to be inappropriate, but
do not affect the clarity of the DIS.  The serious breakage is
called out in the edits proposed below.
