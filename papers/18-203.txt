From: John Reid
Subject: Response to JP060 and JP064
Date: 2018-June-12

1. JP060

JP060 asks about the restriction on the formal parameter dv of
CFI_establish that "It shall not have the same value as either a C
formal parameter that corresponds to a Fortran actual argument or a C
actual argument that corresponds to a Fortran dummy argument."  It
says that it should be clearly described that a pointer to a C
descriptor established by CFI_establish can be a C actual argument
associated with a Fortran dummy.

2. Response to JP060
The restriction is in the present tense and does not refer to possible
uses during later execution. No change is needed.


3. JP064
JP064 makes the same point with respect to the formal parameter result
of CFI_section and the response is the same.
