1. Papers from Tuesday.

159r1 Done.
150r1 Done.
151 Done.
153r1 Done with modification:
  Did the first edit as per the instructions, which do not end up with the
  result claimed (it has "with it" not "with the initial-data-target"; I
  think that "with it" is fine).
157r1 Done.
162 Done.
165 alternative wording for first edit, Done with modification:
  Also de-indexed everything in Annex A, as that is just a recapitulation
  of normative requirements elsewhere (most hyperlinks in Annex A were
  already non-indexed).
167 Done.
168 Done.
169 Done.
170 Done.
152r1 Done.
166 Done.
172 Done with modification:
  Also changed the reference for the term "established coarray" from
  "5.4.7 Coarray" to "5.4.8 Established coarrays".
173 Done with modification:
  Did some extra hyperlinking.
174 Done.
175 Done.
147 Done, hyperlinking the table names; the table number references are
    now automatically generated.
149 Done.
171 Done with modifications.
  [xvii] Added comma before inserting "and".
  [62:34] Inserted comma that was missing from this 3-item list.
  [409:12] Ditto for MAXLOC at [406:2].

2. Papers from Wednesday

177r1 Done with modifications:
  [278:15] Inserted space after 0X.
  [538:39+] semicolon not full stop.
155r2 Done with modification:
  Improved (I hope) the wording in the intro.
179 Done.
142r1 Done.
146r2 Done.
154r2 Done with modification.
  Reworded the result value paragraph to be more like our usual phrasing.
163r1 Done.
164r1 Done.
178 Done.

3. Papers from Thursday

180r1 Done with modification:
  Put the new constraint after C1138 to which it is relevant, rather than
  after C1139 which is about IEEE.

161r2 Done with complete rewriting of the paragraph
  - made more similar to other similar situations' text
  - specify that "failed image" is an error condition thus when STAT is
    absent error termination will be initiated.
i.e. instead of
  "If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of an atomic
   subroutine and an error condition occurs, it is assigned a positive
   value, and any other argument that is not INTENT (IN) becomes
   undefined. If the ATOM argument is on a failed image, the value is
   STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. If any other error condition
   occurs, the value is processor dependent and different from
   STAT_FAILED_IMAGE."
it now reads
  "If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of an atomic
   subroutine and an error condition occurs, any other argument that is
   not INTENT (IN) becomes undefined. If the ATOM argument is on a failed
   image, an error condition occurs and the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from
   the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is assigned to the STAT argument.
   If any other error condition occurs, the STAT argument is assigned a
   processor-dependent positive value that is different from the value of
   STAT_FAILED_IMAGE."

148r3 Done with modification:
  Instead of "current when the CHANGE TEAM construct began execution"
  Inserted   "current when the CHANGE TEAM statement was executed"
  which I think is less ambiguous as to what team is intended
  (paper version sounds like it might mean the new team not the
   original team, which is what I think was intended).

4. Final changes

(a) Changed the wording in the constraints on EVENT_TYPE and LOCK_TYPE
    to remove an ambiguity, viz changed
        "A component of such a type..."
    to
        "A component that is of such a type..."
    (Otherwise one could mis-read it as constraining the components within
     EVENT_TYPE and LOCK_TYPE instead of components whose type is one of
     the previously mentioned ones.)

(b) Changed the wording in the NOTE for OUT_OF_RANGE, so it now reads
        "on many processors"
    instead of
        "on many modern processors"
    ("modern" was not contributing anything here, and is an unfortunate
     thing to say in a dated standard.)
