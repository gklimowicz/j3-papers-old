1. Introduction

The final sentence of subclause 8.5.9 EXTERNAL attribute states

      A procedure that has both the EXTERNAL and POINTER
      attributes is a procedure pointer.

The statement is true, but it could be misleading.  A procedure
that has both the EXTERNAL and POINTER attributes is a
procedure pointer, but a procedure that does not have the
EXTERNAL attribute but does have the POINTER attribute is also
a procedure pointer.  Dropping the words "both" and "EXTERNAL
and" eliminates the possible confusion, but it makes the
sentence seem out-of-place, because it no longer refers to
the EXTERNAL attribute.  I propose deleting the sentence as it
adds nothing but possible confusion to the standard.  An edit
is supplied.

2. Edit

[8.5.9 EXTERNAL attribute, p3, [104:14]] Delete the sentence
 "A procedure that ... procedure pointer."
