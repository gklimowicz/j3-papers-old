Discussion

The relaxed rules for segment ordering concerning referencing of
VOLATILE scalars is meant to facilitate certain low-level but common
constructions (like spin loops). This permission should be kept to a
minimum to avoid semantic and implementation difficulties.  We
therefore recommend that only references to named scalar co-arrays be
excluded from segment ordering rules.

While reviewing the terminology used in this section we noticed that
the first bullet point does not adequately cover non-co-array TARGETs
accessed by other images via pointer components of co-arrays.

Edits to J3/07-007r2

[212:1] In 8.5.1 Image control statements, paragraph 6, line 1,
replace "co-array" by "named scalar co-array".

[212:4] In 8.5.1 Image control statements, paragraph 6, line 4,
replace "co-array" by "variable".
