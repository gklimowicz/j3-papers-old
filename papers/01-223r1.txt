Subject: Issues 295, 314, 124 & NOT_A_UNIT & Miscellany

Other papers have addressed Unresolved Issues 127 & 314,
so this paper no longer pretends to do so.

While reading Ch 9 in pursuit of Issue 127, I found
the following which resulted in comments, some of which
spilled over into other chapters:

Edits:

In Chapter 1:  Alert the reader to changes.

3:22 Change "neither be" to "be neither"

3:23+ Add paragraph to warn of possible change:

"Earlier standards did not allow a logical unit number
to have a negative value.  This standard allows the values
of the preconnected input, output, and error units to be
negative.  Therefore, a program which relied upon
negative unit numbers to signal a condition may have
a different interpretation under this standard.  Earlier standards
specified that NUMBER= to INQUIRE returns -1
if the file is not connected.
This standard specifies the value of the constant NOT_A_UNIT
defined in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV,
which need not equal -1."

In Chapter 9:  Add NOT_A_UNIT, eliminate IO_MODE, and cetera.

165:18 Delete "a sequence of"

168:23 Add "There may be a last file storage unit."

168:41 Add "There may be a last file storage unit."

192:4 Change "met,"
to "met (10.6.5, 12.3.2),"

196:16-19 Delete Issue 314

203:43 Change "-1"
to "the value of NOT_A_UNIT named constant
of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module (13.12)"

208:28-33 Delete Issue 124

In Chapter 13:
Add definition of NOT_A_UNIT to and
delete ISO_IO_MODE from ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

338:30+ Add Section

NOT_A_UNIT

The value of the default integer scalar constant NOT_A_UNIT
is assigned to the variable specified in a NUMBER= specifier
if an INQUIRE statement finds a file to be not connected to any
unit.  The value shall be negative and different from any of
INPUT_UNIT, OUTPUT_UNIT, and ERROR_UNIT.

Delete the definition of ISO_IO_MODE.

338:31-41 Delete

Miscellaneous Edits (Spelling & Grammar)

194:15 Change "hoever" to "however"

290:27 Change "a allowable" to "allowed"
