Subject:	Issue 13 and Interpretation 84

1. Issue 13
-----------

Issue 13 says:
  "the default initialization stuff for INTENT(OUT) is not handled"

This is in fact handled by 14.7.5 item (22).

It further says:
  "an interp ... Pending such an interp, this is a placeholder ..."

Since this paper raises the interpretation question, the issue can be deleted.

2. Edits to 00-007
------------------

[357:4-8] Delete the J3 note.

3. Interpretation Request
-------------------------

NUMBER: 000084
TITLE: Events that cause variables to be defined
KEYWORDS: Definition status, INTENT(OUT)
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress
QUESTION:

Item (6) of 14.7.5 says
  "A reference to a procedure causes the entire dummy argument to become
   defined if the entire corresponding actual argument is defined with a value
   that is not a statement label.
   A reference to a procedure causes a subobject of a dummy argument to become
   defined if the corresponding subobject of the corresponding actual argument
   is defined."

For an INTENT(OUT) dummy this appears to conflict with 14.7.6 item (13)(b)
  "When a procedure is invoked ...
   (b) A dummy argument with INTENT(OUT) is undefined except for any nonpointer
       direct components of the argument for which default initialization is
       specified."

So in

    X = 3
    CALL S(X)
    ...
    SUBROUTINE S(A)
    INTENT(OUT) A
    ...

Is A defined (with the value 3) in accordance with 14.7.5, or undefined in
accordance with 14.7.6?

Similarly, for subobjects of INTENT(OUT) dummies, does 14.7.5 take precedence
or 14.7.6?

ANSWER:

A is undefined in accordance with 14.7.6.  An edit is supplied to remove the
conflict.  Similarly, 14.7.6 takes precedence for subobjects.

EDITS:

To Fortran 95:

[289:9] Before "entire"
        insert "dummy argument does not have INTENT(OUT) and the".
[289:12] Before "corresponding"
         insert "dummy argument does not have INTENT(OUT) and the".

To draft Fortran 2002:

No edits required (above fixes already incorporated).
