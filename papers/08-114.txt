Discussion:

As noted in UTI 150, page 362, examples are required for the new
intrinsic functions BGE, BGT, BLE, BLT.

Edits to J3/08-007:

[362:22+] At the end of 13.7.20 BGE (I, J), add an Example paragraph:

"Example. BGE (z"ffffffff", I) has the value true for any value of the
integer I for which BIT_SIZE(I) is 32. For an implementation that uses
the two's complement representation of default integer values, BGE(-1,
1) has the value true."


[363:5+]  At the end of 13.7.21 BGT (I, J), add an Example paragraph:

"Example. BGT (z"ffffffff", z"ffffcfff") has the value true.  For an
implementation that uses the two's complement representation of
default integer values, BGT(-1, 1) has the value true."


[363:17+] At the end of 13.7.22 BLE (I, J), add an Example paragraph:

"Example. BLE (z"00000000", I) has the value true for any value of the
integer I. For an implementation that uses the two's complement
representation of default integer values, BLE(1, -1) has the value
true."


[363:29+] At the end of 13.7.23 BLT (I, J), add an Example paragraph:

"Example. BLT (z"feedface", z"deadbeef") has the value false. For an
implementation that uses the two's complement representation of
default integer values, BLT(1, -1) has the value true."
