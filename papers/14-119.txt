NUMBER: F08/xxxx
TITLE:  MOVE_ALLOC for a remote array
KEYWORDS: allocation, coindexed
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Was it intended that MOVE_ALLOC can affect the allocation status of an
array on an image other than the executing image? An example is
     CALL MOVE_ALLOC(A,B[I]%A)

ANSWER:

No, it was not intended that the executing image can affect the
allocation status of an array on an image other than the executing
image. Edits are provided to correct this.

EDITS to 10-007r1:
