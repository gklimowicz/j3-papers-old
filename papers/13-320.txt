Subject: UK-10.2d Obsolescenting enddo labels
Date: 2013 September 23

Reference: N1975, N1982

Specification: A label on an enddo is obsolescent

Syntax: A label on an enddo is obsolescent

Edits:

{change constraint C815 to reflect the obsolescence}

[175:5] Change "corresponding <<end-do>> shall"
to "corresponding <<end-do-stmt>> or <<continue-stmt>> shall"
with "<<end-do-stmt>> or" in small font

{add to list of obsolescent features in B.2}
{note that several features may be added to the obsolescent list
 it is the editor's choice which order they appear}

[465:26+] add

"B2.9+ Labels on ENDDO Statements
The label on the ENDDO ststement is redundant
with the block name.  Further, the label allows
unrestricted branches and, for its main purpose,
(the target of a conditional branch to skip the rest
of the current iteration)
is redundant with the CYCLE statement.
The CYCLE statement is more clear."
