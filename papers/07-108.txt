Subject: Constraintifying subclause 12.4.3.3.4
Date: 2007 January 22

Subclause 12.4.3.4.5 was moved from clause 16 to clause 12 by 06-193r1.
Processors are required to report violations of provisions in clause 16 in
the same way as they are required to report violations of constraints.
Conversion of the ordinary normative text to constraints was postponed
when the subclause was moved.

Editor: Make the paragraph a constraint on syntax rule number R1202.  In
the last sentence, replace "with" by "from".

Editor: Make the paragraph a constraint on syntax rule number R1202.
Does Kurt's perl program to collect constraints into Annex D also include
the list in the collection?
