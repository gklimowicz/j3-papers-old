Subject: Unresolved issues 205, 206, 207

1. Introduction

These issues are all about expression classification (initialization vs.
constant, etc.) and the IEEE modules.

2. Issue 205

This says essentially nothing that is not adequately covered by issue 132.
The issue with IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND is a red herring - there are other
cases where initialization expressions are not constant expressions (e.g.
parameterised derived types with kind type parameters).

3. Issue 206

This says
  "Why just IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND and not anything else from the IEEE
   modules..."

Because the whole purpose of IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND is for it to be used in
kind specifiers i.e. in initialization expressions.  Omitting this
functionality was an inadvertant oversight in the first edition of the TR.
There is, I believe, no controversy about allowing IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND in
an initialization expression: it was an obvious mistake to make the function
completely useless in the first edition.

It is to be included in the next edition of the TR.

The next edition of the TR does not allow anything else from the IEEE modules
in initialization expressions.

4. Issue 207

This says
  "... all the functions in the IEEE modules are specification functions.
   This might be worth mentioning in a note..."

I disagree.  The functions in the IEEE modules are not the sort of function
one is particularly likely to want to invoke in order to calculate an array
bound.  It is only worth noting this sort of thing if it is likely that a
significant number of users will want to do it.
