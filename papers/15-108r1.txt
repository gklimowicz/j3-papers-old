Subject:   Allow mixed-kind in SIGN functions

1. Introduction
===============

In the SIGN function, the only interesting part of the value of the
second argument is its sign.  It therefore doesn't seem necessary that
the arguments are required to have the same kind.  Indeed, the second
argument could be either real or integer, and of any kind.

2. Proposal
===========

The arguments of SIGN are not required to have the same type or kind.

3. Draft Edits
==============

[Introduction, under "Intrinsic Functions"] Insert list item

"-- The B argument to the SIGN function is not required to be of the
    same type or kind as the A argument.
"

{Compare to 13.7.49p4 ( DOT_PRODUCT).}

[396:15 13.7.158p3] Replace "the same ... A" with "type integer or
real".
