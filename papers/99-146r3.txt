Subject: Unresolved issue 9


1. Introduction

In issue 9 Richard Maine makes 2 suggestions:
(1) allowing initialisation of objects containing allocatable components
    (at least to NULL()) and
(2) allowing PARAMETERs of these types.

I concur.

Since this makes

  TYPE T2
    REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: X
    INTEGER ANSWER
  END TYPE
  TYPE(T2) :: V = T(NULL(),42)

legal, perhaps

  TYPE T
    REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: X => NULL()
  END TYPE

should be legal also (for consistency)?  On the other hand, this adds no
functionality at all and is an entirely redundant initialization, so I
propose
NOT adding it.  If it is required, edits are required to [43:30-34] at
least.

2. A related issue

This was just unresolved issue 10, so it is already in the document.
