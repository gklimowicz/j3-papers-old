Subject: J3 Fortran interp F03/0099: Clause 16 does not account for
         volatile variable

NUMBER: F03/0099
TITLE: Clause 16 does not account for volatile variable
KEYWORDS: volatile, defined, undefined
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS:


QUESTION:

Should the various lists in clause 16 that describe definition and
association be modified to include the effects of volatile variables?

In particular, 16.4.2.1.1 through 16.4.2.1.2 do not mention the fact
that pointer association status can be volatile and change by other
means.

16.5.4 says "all other variables are initially undefined.?  Can a
volatile variable be initially defined by other means?

16.5 (26) says volatile variables "become defined", but they also can
become undefined, by other means.

Allocatable volatile variables can become allocated or unallocated by
other means also.

ANSWER:

Yes, the lists in clause 16 should be modified to include the effects of 
volatility.  In addition, the effects of volatile on pointer objects 
are not completely specified in clause 5.  The effect on allocatable 
objects is not complete in clause 6.

EDITS:

[85:10] In the paragraph between note 5.21 and note 5.22, change 
"association status and array bounds" to "association status, dynamic 
type and type parameters, and array bounds"

[415:27]  Add a new paragraph at the end of 16.4.2.1.4

"The association status of a pointer object with the VOLATILE attribute
may change by means not specified by the program. If the association
status of such an object changes, its array bounds or deferred type
parameters may change.  If in addition it is polymorphic, its dynamic type
and additional type parameters not specified in its declaration may also
change."

[421:42-43] In 16.5.5 Replace list item (26) with (as text, not a list
item)
"In addition, an object with the VOLATILE attribute (5.1.2.16) might
become defined by means not specified by the program."

[423:28+] In 16.5.6 after the last list item insert (as text, not a list
item)
"In addition, an object with the VOLATILE attribute (5.1.2.16) might
become undefined by means not specified by the program."
