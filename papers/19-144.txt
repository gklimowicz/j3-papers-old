1. Introduction

The definition of a procedure pointer (3.108.2) is "procedure
with the EXTERNAL and POINTER attributes".  A procedure pointer
component (7.5.4.1 Component definition statement) does not
have the EXTERNAL attribute, and so it does not satisfy the
definition of a procedure pointer.  An edit to extend the
definition of procedure pointers to include procedure pointer
components is supplied.


2.  Edit

[15:25, 3.108.2 "procedure pointer"]  Insert

"procedure pointer component (7.5.4.1) or "

before

"procedure with the EXTERNAL and POINTER attributes".
