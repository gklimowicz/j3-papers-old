1. Introduction
===============

The cause of UTI 13 and UTI 14 is suboptimal description of the new
"module accessibility" feature.

Instead of describing it in terms of "accessibility of the module" it
should be described in terms of "accessibility of identifiers accessed
from the module."  The description of the default accessibility of an
identifier accessed by use association and for which default
accessibility is specified indirectly by the name of a module from which
it is accessed appearing as the <access-name> in an <access-stmt> should
appear in 5.6.1, the only place where that form of access control is
described.

Alternatively, the new feature could be deleted, since it has very
narrow usefulness.

2. Edits
========

[xvii:5 Introduction under "Program units and procedures] Replace "that
of" with "the default accessibility of".

[92:12-15 5.5.2p3] Replace "An identifier ... otherwise" with "An
identifier whose accessibility is not explicitly specified has default
accessibility."

{The concept the replaced material attempts to describe should be
described in 5.6.1, where the only way to declare it appears."

[106:33-34 5.6.1p1] Delete "Appearance of a module ... from that
module."

[106:42+ 5.6.1p1+] Insert a paragraph:

"If an identifier is accessed by use association, and the name of any
module from which it is accessed appears [as the <access-name>](?) in an
<access-stmt>, its default accessibility is PRIVATE if the <access-spec>
in every such <access-stmt> is PRIVATE, or PUBLIC if the <access-spec>
in any such <access-stmt> is PUBLIC.  [For such an identifier, this
overrides the default accessibility for the module in which it is
accessed.](?)"

{In light of "entities accessed from a module whose name does not appear
in any <access-stmt> in the module" at [106:35-36], the last sentence
might not be needed.}

Delete UTI 13 and UTI 14 if this adequately addresses the problem they
describe.

3. Alternative edits
====================

[xvii:4-6 Introduction under "Program units and procedures] Delete "In a
module ... using module."

[92:12-15 5.5.2p3] Replace "An identifier ... otherwise" with "An
identifier whose accessibility is not explicitly specified has default
accessibility."

[106:27 C569] Delete "module,"

[106:29-30 C570] Delete C570.

[106:29-31 C571] Delete C571.

[106:33 5.6.1p1] Delete "that is not a module name".

[106:33-34 5.6.1p1] Delete "Appearance of a module ... from that
module."

[106:36 5.6.1p1] Replace "a module" with "other modules".  Delete
"whose name ... in the module".

[107 NOTE 5.26] Delete NOTE 5.26.

Delete UTI 13 and UTI 14 if this adequately addresses the problem they
describe.
