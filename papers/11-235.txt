Discussion

Comment GB3 in WG5/N1881 asks for a note in 2.4.2 "with an explanation
of asynchronous communication and an example illustrating it". Here is
a suggestion for that note.

At the end of 2.4.2 of WG5/N1869 (page 5) add

NOTE 2.5
Asynchronous communication can be used for nonblocking MPI calls such
as MPI_IRECV and MPI_ISEND.  For example,
    REAL :: BUF(100,100)
       ... ! Code that involves BUF
    CALL MPI_IRECV(BUF,...REQ,...)
       ... ! Code that does not involve BUF
    CALL MPI_WAIT(REQ,...)
       ... ! Code that involves BUF
In this example, there is asynchronous input communication and BUF is
a pending communication affector between the two calls. It must not be
used there in any way. MPI_IRECV may return while the communication
(reading values into BUF) is still underway.  The intention is that
the code between MPI_IRECV and MPI_WAIT executes without waiting for
this communication to complete. This is just like asynchronous data
transfer input and the rules are similar.

Similar code with the call of MPI_IRECV replaced by a call of MPI_ISEND
is asynchronous output communication. It is just like asynchronous data
transfer output and the value of BUF is permitted to be referenced
between the calls.
