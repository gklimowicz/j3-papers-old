1. Introduction

The example that the existing constraint fails to prevent is:
  REAL,TARGET :: x[*]
  REAL,POINTER :: p
  REAL,VOLATILE,POINTER :: q
  p => x
  q => p

This achieves the association of a volatile pointer with a coarray.
Similar shenanigans will result in the association of a nonvolatile
pointer with a volatile coarray.


2. Edits to 09-007r1

[102:14] 5.3.19p2
  Change "7.2.2.1" (Pointer assignment:General)
  to "7.2.2.3" (Data pointer assignment).
{We are about to add a paragraph there to do this.}

[102:19+0] Delete UTI 163.

[161:19+] 7.2.2.3p7+, insert new paragraph
  "If the target of a pointer is a coarray, the pointer shall have the
   VOLATILE attribute if and only if the coarray has the VOLATILE
   attribute."
{Added paragraph describing the relationship between coarrays and
 VOLATILE re pointer association.}
