Subject:  More purely editorial stuff

After Richard's letter about purely editorial/typo fixes, I did

  grep -e ' - ' -e ' -$' -e '^- ' [ac]*tex

and found the following places where hyphens (-) ought to be em-dashes (--).

aa.tex:\tdef{construct} (\ref{D7:Masked array assignment - WHERE},
aa.tex:\tdef{control mask} (\ref{D7:Masked array assignment - WHERE}) : In a
ac.tex:\subsubsection{WHERE statement (\ref{D7:Masked array assignment -
WHERE})}
c07.tex:\divn\subsection{Masked array assignment - WHERE}
c07.tex:- WHERE}) within a \si{forall-construct} is executed in sequence.
When a
c16.tex: (\ref{D7:Masked array assignment - WHERE}, \ref{D7:FORALL},
c16.tex:  statement to become defined (\ref{D7:Masked array assignment -
WHERE}).
c16.tex:    no other active scoping unit is referencing the module -
following

There are also some "Element array assignment - FORALL", but they are only
in a
\label and its \ref's, so there's no need to fix them.

There are also a few places where hyphens ought to be minus signs, i.e.
inside of math mode:

aa.tex:nearest, towards zero, up (towards $\infty$), and down (towards -
$\infty$).
c06.tex:  & 1) $d_{i}$~=~max~($k_{i}$ - $j_{i}$ + 1, 0) is the size of the
$i$th
c07.tex:\kw*{-}  & Subtraction    & $x_1$ - $x_2$    & Subtract $x_2$ from
$x_1$\\
c07.tex:-        & Negation       & - $x_2$          & Negate $x_2$\\

If anybody really needs line numbers instead of source text, I can provide
them.
I suspect, however, that the Editor is the only interested party, and the
source
text is probably more useful for him.
