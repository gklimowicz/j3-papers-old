1. Requirements from 13-244r1
-----------------------------

  "Processors are required to have the ability to report the appearance
   of an intrinsic procedure not described in the standard.  Fortran
   2003 added intrinsic modules.  Processors are not required to report
   the use of non-standard intrinsic modules, nor of non-standard
   entities from standard intrinsic modules, or of non-standard use of
   standard intrinsic procedures.  Doing so would aid
   standards-conformance checking of programs."

2. Edits to 10-007r1
--------------------

[xv Introduction p2+]

In the new list of new features, add

" o Intrinsic procedures and modules:
    A processor is required to report
    - use of an intrinsic procedure if the name is defined in Clause 13
      but reference is inconsistent with requirements in Clause 13,
    - use of intrinsic modules whose names are not defined in Clause 13,
      14 or 15,
    - use of a procedure from an intrinsic module, if the procedure name
      is not defined in Clause 13, 14 or 15, or reference is
      inconsistent with requirements in Clause 13, 14 or 15.
"

[23:27 1.5.2p2(7)] Replace "intrinsic procedures whose names are not
defined in Clause; and" with "an intrinsic procedure if the name is not
defined in Clause 13 or reference is inconsistent with requirements
specified in Clause 13;"

[23:27+ 1.5.2p2(7+)] Insert list items

" (7a) it contains the capability to detect and report the use within a
       submitted program unit of intrinsic modules whose names are not
       defined in Clause 13, 14 or 15;

  (7b) it contains the capability to detect and report the use within a
       submitted program unit of a procedure from an intrinsic module,
       if the procedure name is not defined in Clause 13, 14 or 15, or
       reference is inconsistent with requirements specified in Clause
       13, 14 or 15; and
"
