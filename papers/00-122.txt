Unresolved issue 149 [259:18-21] is a place holder to allow sequence assocation
that involves a change in character length for characters of kind C_CHAR.
Currently, sequence association involving a change in character length is only
permitted for characters of default kind, and C_CHAR isn't necessarily the same
as the default kind.

To remedy this, we'll specify that characters of kind C_CHAR occupy contiguous
unspecified storage units and generalize the description of sequence
association involving characters.

  After "of type default character"
  add   ", of type character with the C character kind (16.1),"

[261:7]
  Change "or a scalar of type default character"
  to     "a scalar of type default character, or a scalar of type character
          with the C character kind (16.1)"

[261:11]
  After "default character"
  add   "or of type character with the C character kind,"

[261:12]
  Change "character storage units"
  to     "storage units"

[261:14]
  Change "character storage units"
  to     "storage units"

[261:15]
  Change "character storage units"
  to     "storage units"

[261:17]
  After "default character"
  add   "or of type character with the C character kind,"

[261:18]
  Change "character storage units"
  to     "storage units"

[353:38]
  After "nondefault character"
  add   ", other than character with the C character kind (16.1),"

[353:40]
  Before ";"
  insert ", and that is different from the unspecified storage units of (x)"
  [[Editor:  Please note that (x) here refers to the list item added by the
             next edit.]]

[353:40+]
  Insert a new list item after (5), and renumber the items that follow:
    "(x) A nonpointer scalar object of type character with the C character
         kind of length <len> occupies <len> contiguous unspecified
         storage units;"

[386:6]
  Add a new sentence
    "The value of C_CHAR is known as the <<C character kind>>."

[386:38+]
  Add new paragraph to Note 16.3
    "For example, given a C function with a prototype like the following

       void copy(char in[], char out[]);

     it can be declared and used in a Fortran program as follows.

       USE ISO_C_BINDING
       INTERFACE
         BIND(C) SUBROUTINE COPY(IN, OUT)
           USE ISO_C_BINDING
           CHARACTER(KIND=C_CHAR), DIMENSION(*) :: IN, OUT
         END SUBROUTINE COPY
       END INTERFACE

       CHARACTER(LEN=10, KIND=C_CHAR) :: DIGIT_STRING = C_CHAR_'123456789'
       CHARACTER(KIND=C_CHAR) :: DIGIT_ARR(10)

       CALL COPY(DIGIT_STRING, DIGIT_ARR)
       PRINT '(1X, A1)', DIGIT_ARR
       END"


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unresolved issue 120 [387:1-10] points out that there is no restriction on the
length parameter of a character dummy that prevents it from being assumed.

[386:29-30] Replace the sentence that begins

     "In the case of character type, . . . ."

   with

     "Futhermore, a Fortran entity of type character with a nonconstant length
      parameter or with a length parameter that is not equal to one does not
      interoperate with any C entity."
