Discussion

While not incorrect, the words that describe the effect of a SYNC IMAGES 
statement do not make clear when a SYNC IMAGES statement on one image
corresponds to a SYNC IMAGES statement on another and that segments that 
executed before the SYNC IMAGES statement on either image precede the 
segments that execute after the corresponding SYNC IMAGES statement on 
the other image.


Edit to J3/07-007

[202:3-7] In the fourth paragraph of 8.5.4 SYNC IMAGES statement,
replace all but the first sentence with

"Executions of SYNC IMAGES statements on images M and T correspond if the 
number of times image M has executed a SYNC IMAGES statement with T in its 
image set is the same as the number of times image T has executed a 
SYNC IMAGES statement with M in its image set. The segments that executed 
before the SYNC IMAGES statement on either image precede the segments that 
execute after the corresponding SYNC IMAGES statement on the other image."
