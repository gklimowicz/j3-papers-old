General: For the arithmetic functions with two arguments, e.g.,
IEEE_REM, are arguments with different radices supported?  It should
either be stated explicitly, or denied explicitly.

/JOR: The two and three argument IEEE arithmetic functions that are
new in Fortran 2015 require homogeneous operands.  The IEEE
arithmetic functions carried over from Fortran 2008, other than
IEEE_REM, have well-defined semantics for arguments with different
radices.  IEEE_REM does not have well-defined semantics for some
combinations of arguments of different radices.  The definition of
IEEE_REM given in 16-007 requires the result to be exact.  For some
combinations of mixed radix arguments, no exact result is possible.
ISO/IEC 60559:2011 requires the operands of the remainder operation
to be homogeneous.

Although we envisaged supporting non-binary radices for IEEE kinds
in Fortran 2008, we did not actually manage to permit them; so
technically, there is no incompatibility.

Edits are provided to require the arguments of IEEE_REM to have the
same radix.


Edits to 16-007
---------------

[xvii, Introduction] Insert in the item that lists changes to the
IEEE modules:

"The function IEEE_REM now requires its arguments to have the
 same radix."

[443:3, 14.11.31p4] Replace "the value false." with

"the value false, or if RADIX(X) is not equal to RADIX(Y)."
