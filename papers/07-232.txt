TITLE:    Array components cannot depend on length type parameters
KEYWORDS: length parameter, specification expression, component

STATUS:   J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

  MODULE m
    TYPE t(n)
      INTEGER,LEN :: n
      REAL v(n)
    END TYPE
  END

According to C542 at [78:21-22], the bounds in that <explicit-shape-spec>
are required to be initialization expressions.  That seems to prevent the
intended use of length type parameters.

Is the example intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, the example was intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is provided to correct this.

EDITS:

[78:21-22] After "a function result," insert "a component,".
