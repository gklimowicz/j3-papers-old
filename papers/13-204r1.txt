NUMBER: F08/0087
TITLE: Mixed-kind character assignment
KEYWORDS: Mixed kind, character assignment
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Under J3 consideration

QUESTION:

For a processor that supports both ASCII and ISO 10646 UCS-4
character kinds, assuming without loss of generality that
Selected_Char_Kind('ASCII') is equal to 1 and that
Selected_Char_Kind('ISO_10646') is equal to 10646,
consider the following program:

  Module charkinds
    Integer,Parameter :: ascii = 1
    Integer,Parameter :: ucs4 = 10646
  End Module
  Module overload
    Use charkinds
    Interface Assignment(=)
      Module Procedure char_asg
    End Interface
  Contains
    Subroutine char_asg(a,b)
      Character(*,ascii),Intent(Out) :: a
      Character(*,ucs4),Intent(In) :: b
      Do i=1,Min(Len(a),Len(b))
        a(i:i) = Achar(Mod(Iachar(b(i:i))+1,127))
      End Do
      a(i:) = Repeat('*',Len(a)-Len(b))
    End Subroutine
  End Module
  Program test
    Use overload
    Character(10,ascii) x
    x = ucs4_'Hello'
    Print *,'"',x,'"'
  End Program

This program conforms to Fortran 95, which permitted user-defined
assignment betweeen all characters with different kinds.

However, Fortran 2008 provides intrinsic assignment between
ISO 10646 characters and ASCII characters, so user-defined assignment
is not permitted (12.4.3.4.3 and Table 7.8).

Thus there seems to be a contradiction between the Fortran 95
compatibility description in 1.6.3 and 12.4.3.4.3.

Is the program intended to conform to Fortran 2008?
And if it does, does it print
 "Hello     "
(intrinsic assignment)
 "Ifmmp*****"
(user-defined assignment)?

ANSWER:

The program was not intended to conform to the standard.
An edit is provided to remove the contradiction.

EDITS:

[24:14] 1.6.3p1, "Any"
        -> "Except as identified in this subclause, any".
{No longer true.}

[24:15] Split the sentence "The ..." introducing the list into a
        separate paragraph (which will be the third paragraph), and
        insert a new paragraph (as the second paragraph) as follows:
  "Fortran 95 permitted defined assignment between character strings
   of the same rank and different kinds.  This part of ISO/IEC 1539
   does not permit that if both of the different kinds are ASCII,
   ISO 10646, or default kind."
{Describe the incompatibility.}
   
[25:2+] 1.6.4, after p2, insert a new paragraph.
  "Fortran 90 permitted defined assignment between character strings
   of the same rank and different kinds.  This part of ISO/IEC 1539
   does not permit that if both of the different kinds are ASCII,
   ISO 10646, or default kind."
{Describe the incompatibility.}
