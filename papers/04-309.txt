NUMBER: F90/000096
TITLE: Definition of "Declaration"
KEYWORDS: declaration, specification
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:  "Declaration" is a significant concept of Fortran 90.

Section 5 is titled "Data object declarations and specifications" and
what were in FORTRAN 77 "type statements" are now "type declaration
statements".  5.1.1 states

    "A type specifier specifies the type of all entities declared in
     an entity declaration list."

Nowhere, though, is there a definition of "declaration".

What does it mean, in Fortran 90, to "declare" something?

ANSWER:

That is correct, the standard does not define the term "declaration".  It is
used both in the sense of explicit specification, and of implicit declaration
via usage or context.  Both of these meanings fall within the normal English
meaning of the term.

The suggestion that the standard should define the term "declaration" may be
considered for a future revision of the standard.

EDIT: None.
