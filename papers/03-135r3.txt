Subject: Edits for US 2.14 Intrinsic and nonintrinsic modules

One item in n1510 asks whether an Intrinsic module
and a nonintrinsic module can have the same name
in the same program.

Pursuiant to Tuesday's straw votes, this paper
attempt to allow an intrinsic module and a nonintrinsic
module to have the same name in the same program.
An intrinsic module and a nonintrinsic module
may not have the same name in the same scope.

"C11xx (R1109) A scoping unit shall not access
an intrinsic module and a nonintrinsic module
of the same name."

395:20 Change "." to ", except that an intrinsic module
and a nonintrinsic module may have the same name
in the same program."
