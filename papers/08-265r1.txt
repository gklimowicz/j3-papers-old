NOTE: This paper supersedes and entirely replaces J3/08-148r1 passed
at Meeting 184.

Discussion:

We did not intend to allow coarray dummy arguments or coarray components
to have the VALUE attribute. An edit is provided to make this clear.

Edit to J3/08-007r2:

[99: 5.3.18p1 C556] In the first constraint in 5.3.18 "VALUE
attribute":

Insert "that is not a coarray and does not have a coarray
ultimate component" at the end of the sentence.
