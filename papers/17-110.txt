Subject: command lines on image >1 no longer PD

Reference: 17-007

In Annex Annex A, Processor Dependencies, reference
to COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, GET_COMMAND, and GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT
on other than image 1 is listed.  This is no longer so,
as remarked in the Introduction, and as not stated
in the individual procedure descriptions in Clause 16.

This oversight should be corrected.

Edits to 17-007:

{in Annex A.2 processor Dependencies}

At [539:12-13] delete the bullet item
"the effects of calling COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE,
GET_COMMAND, and GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT on any image other than image 1
in the initial team (16.7);"

{remove outdated claims}
