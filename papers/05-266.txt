Subject: C_LOC and contiguous arrays

References: J3/05-235r3

Specification:

The proposed edits for the CONTIGUOUS attribute (see J3/05-235r3)
introduce the concept of a contiguous array but do not complete the
integration process. There are a couple of situations where contiguity
matters in the standard:

1) (Run time) Contiguity is necessary for certain operations to make
sense. Examples are arguments to C_LOC (C does not have strided arrays!)
or rank mismatch for array arguments (see 272:19,26).
2) During argument association if the dummy is contiguous and the actual
is not copy in/out can take place which makes array temporaries.
Examples are pointer association status preservation across calls and
ASYNCHRONOUS/VOLATILE attribute (see 271:6 C1232/C1233).

CONTIGUOUS affects both of these situations. Some arrays which could
previously be noncontiguous and thus had to be excluded from, for
example, C_LOC, can now be specified to be contiguous and should no
longer be excluded. Additionally there are now new ways to guarantee
that copy in/out won't take place. We need to consider all the places in
the standard where these two situations are explicitly or implicitly
operating, and consider modifying to account for contiguous arrays. I
give a proposed edit concerning C_LOC below. I include the
ASYNCHRONOUS/VOLATILE edits as well so they are included in discussion.

Edits:

C_LOC
395: 10
Replace item (b) "an allocated allocatable variable that has the TARGET
attribute and is not an array of zero size, or" with new item
(b) "A contiguous object that has the TARGET attribute and is not an
array of zero size, or"
OR (to be decided)
(b) "A variable that has the CONTIGUOUS and TARGET attributes and is not an
array of zero size, or"

ASYNCHRONOUS/VOLATILE:
Delete C1232 at 271:6
271:9 C1233 Replace "If an actual argument is a pointer array"
with
"If an actual argument does not have the CONTIGUOUS attribute"
