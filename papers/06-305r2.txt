Comment: Surely, the associating entity assumes the type parameter
values of the selector even if the associating entity is not

Reply: This is covered by the text at [176:32-33].

Question: There is no mention in 8.1.4 or in 16.5 of how a BLOCK
construct accesses its containing environment.  How do declarations
within the construct override ones of the same name from the
containing environment?

Answer: This covered by the text at [486:26-30].

[488:11-12] After "a module procedure interface body," add " a BLOCK
construct,"
