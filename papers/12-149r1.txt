TITLE: Pointer function reference as variable in assignment
KEYWORDS: Pointer function, assignment, defined operator
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following

  module Funcs

    interface operator ( .op. )
      module procedure Unary, Binary
    end interface

  contains

    function Unary ( Arg )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg
      integer, pointer :: Unary
    ...
    end function Unary

    function Binary ( Arg1, Arg2 )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg1, Arg2
      integer, pointer :: Binary
    ...
    end function Binary

  end module Funcs

  program What

    use Funcs
    integer :: X, Y = 42

    10 .op. x = y

  end program What

Is the "10" in "10 .op. x = y" an operand, and therefore an argument of
a reference to Binary, or is .op. a reference to Unary and "10" a
statement label?

ANSWER:

It was an oversight that this ambiguous program conforms to the syntax
and constraints in two different ways.  Since the standard does not
establish an unique interpretation, it is not a conforming program.
An edit is supplied to clarify.
