1. Introduction
===============

Discussion of various topics regarding asynchronous transfers
and INQUIRE statements brought to subgroup's attention that
a value returned by a SIZE= specifier might change during execution
of an INQUIRE during an asynchronous transfer.

The same cure cribbed from NEXTREC= and applied to POS=
is applied to SIZE=.

2. Edits
========

The SIZE= specifier in INQUIRE is 9.10.2.30 [245:19-26].
The edit is applied to p3.

At [245:26] after the last sentence, add a new sentence:

"If there are pending data transfer operations for the specified unit,
the value assigned is computed as if all the pending data transfers
had already completed."

{The processor may usefully report size when transfers are pending.}
