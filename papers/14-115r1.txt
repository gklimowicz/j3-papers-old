1. Edits for UTI 001
====================

Malcolm suggested two edits to address UTI 001.  Robert Corbett
later suggested a third possible edit.  All edits are against
14-007.

1.1 First alternative
=====================

[107:9] In the first production in R538, replace "<variable>" by
"<variable-designator>".

[107:20-21] Simplify C570.  Delete "A <data-stmt-object> ...
<designator>."  Replace "the variable" by "the <variable-designator>."

[107:26] Revise C572 to correspond to revised R538: Replace "<variable>"
by "<variable-designator>".

[119:15+] Introduce the syntax term <variable-designator> and an
associated constraint.

"R602a <variable-designator> <<is>> <designator>"

"C602a (R602a) <variable-designator> shall designate a variable."

[160:22] In the first production in R737, replace "<variable>" by
"<variable-designator>".

[160:24-25] Replace C725

"C725 (R737) <variable-designator> shall designate a variable that has
      either the POINTER or TARGET attribute, and shall not be an array
      section with a vector subscript."

1.2 Second alternative
======================

[160:26] Replace C726

"C726 (R737) An <expr> shall be a reference to a function that returns a
      data pointer, and shall not have the form of a
      <function-reference>."

1.3 Third alternative
=====================

The syntax change suggested in the first alternative replaces one
syntactic ambiguity with another.  One form of <expr> is a <primary>
that is a <designator>.  A <variable-designator> is also a
<designator>.  Therefore, there are two ways to derive a <designator>
from a <data-target>.

The proposed constraints resolve the ambiguity, but similar
constraints can be used to define a <data-target> with no
syntactic ambiguity.  Simply replace the definition of a
<data-target> with

        <data-target> <<is>>  <expr>

and add a constraint that requires <expr> to be a designator or a
reference to a function, together with the restrictions needed for
the two cases.

Edits
-----

[160:22-23] Replace R737 with

"R737  <data-target> <<is>> <expr>"

[160:24-26] Replace C725 and C726 with

"C725 (R737) The <expr> shall be a designator that designates a
      variable with either the TARGET or POINTER attribute and is
      not an array section with a vector subscript, or it shall be
      a reference to a function that returns a data pointer."
